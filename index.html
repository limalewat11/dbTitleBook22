Also, since some people are just not that hungry first thing, the not-yet-awakened appetite is none too ambitious. It's unfortunate that the first hour of the day is rush hour, but for most of us, that's the reality.<br><br>My sons have always liked a fairly hearty breakfast, so for us, the morning meal is a given. We try to decide the night before what to have for breakfast on school days, so that if the choice is waffles or a hot cooked cereal, I know to allow a little extra time. And because time is so short in the morning, one of my strategies has been to compile a list of possibilities so we're not scrambling for ideas. Speaking of scrambling, you'll note that eggs play a small role in this chapter, with a suggestion or two in the simple breakfast ideas and breakfast sandwiches list; that's because most people who eat eggs already have a set of simple ways to fix them to their family's liking. Instead, you'll find many ideas and easy recipes based on whole grains--these complex carb foods are perfect for getting revved in the morning yet are easy on the palate. Smoothies and other fruit-augmented recipes round out the selections.<br><br>A Basic Breakfast Pantry<br><br>One way to mitigate the breakfast rut is to have an array of good-quality breakfast foods on hand. Go through some of the recipes and ideas in this chapter and jot down the basic ingredients to shop for. See if you can clear a portion of a pantry (or at least a couple of shelves) to keep together all your nonperishable breakfast items--such as hot and cold cereals, granolas, and pancake mixes.<br><br>Here is a list of what you might consider keeping in your pantry. Of course, you need not buy everything on this list, only what appeals to your family. Once you have a basic breakfast repertoire, you may enjoy adding new items from time to time or changing some items seasonally.<br><br>* Good-quality cold breakfast cereals: Have an assortment of organic, whole-grain varieties on hand.<br><br>* Granolas: These are good on their own or mixed with other cold cereals.<br><br>* Hot cereals: See the listing of possibilities.<br><br>* Embellishments for hot and cold cereals: Dried fruits, nuts, and seeds.<br><br>* Flour tortillas: These are great for roll-ups and breakfast quesadillas.<br><br>* Fresh fruits in season: Bananas are welcome all year around, berries are good for summer, and oranges and mangoes are delicious in winter. Serve as is or use for making juices and smoothies or topping cereals.<br><br>* Whole-grain flours for pancakes and waffles: Whole-wheat pastry flour, spelt flour, and cornmeal are especially useful. You might also like to stock good-quality prepared pancake and waffle mixes if you can't see starting from scratch on weekday mornings.<br><br>* Whole-grain frozen waffles: If you're not inclined to make fresh ones in the morning, there are some excellent organic toaster waffles available.<br><br>* Maple syrup and/or honey or other natural sweeteners: Use sweeteners, even natural ones, sparingly in the morning!<br><br>* Fresh whole-grain breads, rolls, bagels, and English muffins: Mix and match for variety; keep some in the freezer.<br><br>* Spreads for bread: All-fruit preserves, nonhydrogenated margarine, dairy or nondairy cream cheese, peanut and other nut butters.<br><br>* Yogurts: Organic low-fat dairy or nondairy varieties; aside from eating on their own, yogurt is useful in homemade pancake and waffle batters, and for making biscuits and other baked goods (see Chapter 10).<br><br>* Organic dairy or nondairy cheeses and cottage cheese<br><br>* Organic cage-free eggs<br><br>* Soy-based faux breakfast meats: This one is entirely optional, but if you like this type of product, you can keep "sausages" and "bacon" in your freezer to use from time to time as a side dish or in breakfast sandwiches.<br>Some Simple Breakfast Ideas<br><br>Breakfast Burritos: Wrap a flour tortilla around a scrambled egg or a small portion of the basic recipe for Tofu Scrambles Galore; Sprinkle with grated dairy or nondairy cheese if desired. Roll up snugly. Serve with orange slices in the winter and strawberries in the summer.<br><br>Breakfast Quesadillas: For each serving, place a 6- to 7-inch flour tortilla in a dry skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle the entire surface lightly with dairy or nondairy cheese and cover. When the cheese is melted, fold over to a half-circle. Continue to cook on both sides, uncovered, until the tortilla begins to turn golden and crisp. Cut in half to form two wedges to serve. Serve with a fruit smoothie (see page 000) or a breakfast fruit salad (see below) for a lively way to start the day.<br><br>Peanut Butter and Banana Roll-ups: For each serving, heat 1 flour tortilla in the microwave until warm and flexible, about 20 seconds. Spread the entire surface with peanut butter (or other nut butter) and place thin banana slices here and there (you'll need about 1/2 medium banana). Roll up snugly; cut in half crosswise to serve.<br><br>Cream Cheese and Berry Roll-ups: For each serving, heat 1 flour tortilla in the microwave until warm and flexible, about 20 seconds. Spread the entire surface with dairy or nondairy cream cheese. Place thinly sliced strawberries over most of the surface or sprinkle with small wild blueberries (or use a little of each). Roll up snugly; cut in half crosswise to serve.<br><br>Pasta for Breakfast: I'm always happy to find plain leftover noodles in the refrigerator in the morning. Angel hair or any small pasta shape (tiny shells, elbow macaroni, ditalini, and such) seem more palatable for breakfast than large, chunky shapes. I like mine with a bit of nonhydrogenated margarine and a little salt, generously topped with wheat germ and ground flaxseed. My husband likes his mixed with nonhydrogenated margarine, cinnamon, and natural granulated sugar, then topped as I do mine. I haven't yet convinced my sons to try pasta for breakfast, but maybe they'll learn eventually. This meal is nicely completed by a fruit smoothie.<br><br>Breakfast Fruit Salad with Cottage Cheese or Yogurt: For a refreshing start to the day, consider fruit salad. To make it more feasible, make your fruit salad the night before and pack it in an airtight container. Summer is easy, with its abundant offering of melons and grapes; strawberries, blueberries, and other berries; peaches and nectarines; and more. Winter fruits are more limited, but you can still get creative with bananas, pears, mangoes, orange slices, and canned pineapple; embellish with some dried fruit if you'd like, such as apricots or pitted prunes. Top your breakfast fruit salad with a mound of cottage cheese or a scoop of low-fat vanilla yogurt or soy yogurt. If you'd like, sprinkle with chopped nuts or granola. Serve with a slice of whole-grain toast or an English muffin.<br><br>Cottage Cheese Salad: For those who are open to veggies in the morning, this is a tasty way to start the day. Simply mix some finely diced tomato, cucumber, and bell pepper into a scoop of cottage cheese. If you'd like, sprinkle with toasted sunflower seeds and fresh dill. Serve with a slice of whole-wheat toast.<br><br>Morning Parfaits: I always thought of parfaits as dessert, even if they were made with yogurt rather than ice cream, until a reader gave me a new view of this treat. Layer low-fat vanilla yogurt or soy yogurt with seasonal fruits in a tall glass or parfait dish, and top with toasted walnuts, almonds, or a sprinkling of granola. Serve with a toasted English muffin or whole-grain bagel.<br><br>Dressed-up Cold Cereal: There are all kinds of ways to make cold cereals more exciting. First of all, make sure the cold cereals you choose are whole grain and all-natural. If they're organic, so much the better. Top cold cereals with any of the following or with any combination that appeals to you:<br>* Fresh fruit (berries and diced peaches in summer, sliced bananas in cold weather)<br><br>* Dried fruit (raisins, cranberries, chopped apricots, dates)<br><br>* A sprinkling of chopped nuts (toasted slivered almonds or chopped walnuts are particularly good on cereal)<br><br>* A sprinkling of granola<br><br>* Wheat germ<br><br>* Ground flaxseeds<br><br>* Toasted sesame or sunflower seeds<br>Breakfast Sandwiches<br>Spreading something nourishing between two slices of bread is an easy and sensible way to start the day. But in the morning, most appetites dictate lighter choices than those you might crave for lunch or dinner. You don't need recipes for making breakfast sandwiches, just a cache of good ideas. Here are some to get you going, and remember, if using dairy cheeses or cream cheese, choose organic whenever possible.<br><br>* Nut butter (try almond, cashew, or soy nut butter as alternatives to peanut butter) and banana on whole-grain bread<br><br>* Any nut butter or fruit butter or all-fruit preserves on whole-grain bread or a roll (apple butter, pear butter, or orange marmalade offer a change of pace from all-fruit preserves)<br><br>* Grilled cheese (using dairy or nondairy cheese of your choice; try sliced rice cheese, which is low in fat and high in calcium) on whole-grain bread; add sliced tomato, if desired<br><br>* Cream cheese (dairy or nondairy) on good-quality cinnamon-raisin bread or Quick Cinnamon-Raisin Bread (page 000)<br><br>* Cream cheese (dairy or nondairy) and sun-dried tomatoes or cured olives on a whole-grain English muffin or bagel<br><br>* Scrambled or fried egg and a slice of organic dairy or nondairy cheese or sauteed soy Canadian bacon on a whole-grain roll<br><br>* Sauteed soy Canadian bacon and a slice of dairy or nondairy cheese on a whole-grain English muffin<br><br>* Sauteed soy Canadian bacon, tomato, and mayonnaise on a whole-grain roll for the heartier appetite<br><br>* Grated organic Cheddar or Cheddar-style soy cheese melted over thinly sliced apple, avocado, or tomato on open-faced English muffins<br><br>dairy/vegan option<br><br>4 to 6 servings<br><br>2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour<br><br>11/2 teaspoons baking powder<br><br>1 teaspoon baking soda<br><br>2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds, optional<br><br>11/2 cups low-fat yogurt or soy yogurt<br><br>11/4 to 11/2 cups low-fat milk or rice milk<br><br>2 tablespoons nonhydrogenated margarine<br><br>Pure maple syrup, all-fruit preserves, or one Quick Fresh Fruit Sauce (page 000)<br>Dairy option<br><br>Calories: 270<br><br>Total fat: 6 g<br><br>Protein: 13 g<br><br>Fiber: 5.9 g<br><br>Carbohydrates: 44 g<br><br>Cholesterol: 7 g<br><br>Sodium: 485 mg<br>Vegan option<br><br>Calories: 266<br><br>Total fat: 6 g<br><br>Protein: 8 g<br><br>Fiber: 6.5 g<br><br>Carbohydrates: 49 g<br><br>Cholesterol: 0 g<br><br>Sodium: 444 mg<br><br>Basic Yogurt Pancakes<br><br>This recipe is wonderful as is, or it can be used as a starting point for variations. Buttermilk is the traditional base for pancakes, but for me, this raised several dilemmas: One, even the largest supermarkets were often out of stock, and two, even when I did find it, it was never organic. I discovered that yogurt is an excellent base for pancake batter, producing tender, golden results. Once we went vegan, I found that soy yogurt works just as well.<br><br>1Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and flaxseeds, if using, in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the yogurt and milk. Stir with a whisk until the batter is just smooth; it should have an easy-to-pour consistency, but not too thin. Add more milk as needed. Don't overbeat.<br><br>2Heat a nonstick griddle or a large nonstick skillet that has been lightly coated with some of the margarine. Ladle on the batter to form 3- to 4-inch pancakes. Cook on both sides over medium heat until golden brown. Serve hot with maple syrup.<br><br>Variations<br><br>Multigrain: Substitute 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the flour with another type of flour such as spelt, kamut, buckwheat, cornmeal, or rye, or use a combination of two different types of flour equaling 1/2 to 3/4 cup.<br><br>Fruity pancakes: Add a cup or so of thinly sliced fruits--one kind or a combination--to the batter. Try pears, peaches, nectarines, strawberries, wild blueberries, or other berries.<br><br>Cinnamon-apple pancakes: Add 1 heaping cup very thinly sliced, peeled apple (any soft cooking variety such as Cortland, McIntosh, or Golden Delicious) and ground cinnamon to taste to the batter.<br><br>Banana-nut: Add 1 medium thinly sliced banana, 1/4 to 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans, and a pinch of ground nutmeg to the batter.<br><br>the basic pancake recipe (page 00) makes a good waffle batter if you reduce the amount of milk to 1 cup, or just a bit more if needed. You can use the multigrain variation, but the fruity variations may be too chunky and/or sticky for your waffle iron (waffles are delicious, however, topped with any of the Quick Fresh Fruit Sauces, below). Before cooking the waffles, I like to lightly spray the waffle iron with cooking oil spray (light olive oil spray is a good choice). On weekday mornings, I don't consider it a big job to prepare waffles, if I cut the Basic Yogurt Pancakes recipe in half to yield 4 large Belgian-style waffles.<br><br>Quick Fresh Fruit Sauces<br><br>for yogurt, pancakes, and waffles<br><br>These nifty combinations of finely diced fruit and all-fruit preserves create nearly instant sauces. Each combination makes enough for four to six 1/3- to 1/2-cup servings as a topping.<br><br>Peach or Nectarine Sauce: Combine 2 cups finely diced peaches or nectarines with 2 to 3 teaspoons all-fruit peach or apricot preserves. Stir together well.<br><br>Strawberry or Strawberry-Blueberry Sauce: Combine 1 pint thinly sliced strawberries (or 1 cup each blueberries and sliced strawberries) with 2 to 3 teaspoons strawberry jam. Stir together well.<br><br>Pear and Mango: Perfect for winter! Combine 1 cup diced, peeled pear and 1 cup diced mango with 2 to 3 teaspoons peach or apricot all-fruit preserves. Stir together well.<br><br>Purely Mango: Combine 2 cups diced mango with 2 to 3 teaspoons mango, peach, or apricot all-fruit preserves.

Cities all around the world are suddenly overwhelmed by epidemics, droughts, famines, floods, and worse.<br>As terrifying forces of light and darkness begin to gather, Kathleen and Colleen find themselves at the center of the final battle for the very soul of humanity. Each of the girls must convince a young detective that she is the true mother of God . . . and that the other is carrying the devil.<br>The stakes couldn't be higher in this page-turning thriller. You won't be able to put it down until the final reveal: which baby is the miracle . . . and which the monster?</p><p>James Patterson's <i>Cradle and All</i> pits the intensity of faith against the certainties of science within an arena of Millennial tensions. A reworking of his 1980 apocalyptic thriller <i>Virgin</i>, this remodeled version boasts a genuinely unnerving premise, amplified with Patterson's fast-paced, uncluttered prose.<p> In the midst of a series of unexplained plagues and famines, two teenage girls are heavily pregnant, despite being virgins. According to the sacred prophecies of Fatima, one will bear the child of Christ and the other, the spawn of Satan. Both Anne Fitzgerald, a former nun turned private detective, and the Vatican's Father Rosetti are sent to investigate. But which girl carries which child? The possibility of a miracle will be tainted with great suffering before the awful, unexpected truth is revealed. As the action moves speedily from the hallowed halls of the Vatican to the media frenzy of America to the small-town hysteria of Ireland, Patterson divines considerable suspense from the novel's central premise, tackling issues of faith with admirable aplomb: </p><p> "All over the world, after all the years of difficulty, decades of diminishing spirituality, so many people still believed.... Everywhere, people talked of the Apocalypse, perhaps the end of the world. Which explained why so many people were suddenly going to church." </p><p> A relentless pace culminating in a superbly twisted ending won't disappoint Patterson's faithful followers, and may even convert some new members. <i>--Danny Graydon</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>My Name is Hope: Anxiety, depression, and life after melancholy</h2><p>For years, John Mark Comer thought he was the only man on the planet who struggled with anxiety and depression. He was dead wrong.<br> <br> Staggering numbers of modern Americans fight anxiety and depression on a daily basis. In 2010, there were 253 million prescriptions for antidepressants in the U.S. alone. That's in a nation of 311 million people. And the battle is nothing new. My Name is Hope is the story of one follower of Jesus who went through the horrors of anxiety and depression and came out the other side. It is his ruthlessly authentic and scripturally authoritative account of prophets and poets, mothers and fathers, and even a Messiah who all came up against anxiety and depression.<br> <br> "With obvious relevance and prophetic resonance," My Name is Hope "speaks needed truth into the over-stressed, over-medicated reality of our lives and culture. It is a book that will awaken and guide many towards a return home to the hope that is ours in Jesus."</p><p>John Mark Comer serves as the lead pastor of Solid Rock Church in Portland, Oregon, a city voted as the most depressed in America by a recent nationwide study. Coffee, food, culture, indie bands, and lots of depressed people. He fits right in.<br> <br> Prior to planting Solid Rock in 2003, John Mark was the college pastor at a large Calvary Chapel church and played in a band signed to BEC recordings. John Mark is married to Tammy and they have two boys, Jude and Moses. They are in the process of adopting a little girl from Uganda.

For so many caught in the web of anxiety and depression, My Name is Hope provides welcome perspective and presents a path toward healing that keeps Jesus at the center. Many will be set free from the shame that comes from the struggle and begin the journey toward renewal by this book." -- Mike Erre | Author of <i> The Jesus of Suburbia <i></i> <br> <br> "With millions of individuals suffering from what David Foster Wallace called 'a peculiar American loneliness,' My Name is Hope has come at a crucial time and has given us a biblical understanding of the stark reality of depression." -- Josh White | Singer/Songwriter/Pastor <br> <br> "John Mark has written an important and needed book of extremely raw, honest, vulnerable sharing about dealing with the times of darkness and depression. As you read this book, you gain hope. Not an artificial, self-oriented or quick fix type of hope, but a hope that comes from God alone. John Mark guides us into how to truly understand this incredible truth. I m very thankful to God for My Name is Hope. We all deal with dark times to some degree or another and we all need to hear about this God-focused hope." ---- Dan Kimball | Author of <i> They Like Jesus But Not The Church <i></i><br><br>"With obvious relevance and prophetic resonance, each chapter speaks needed truth into the over-stressed, over-medicated reality of our lives and culture. Steeped in ruthless authenticity and scriptural authority, John Mark Comer has written a book that will awaken and guide many toward a return home to the hope that is ours in Jesus." ---- Todd Proctor | Lead pastor, Rock Harbor (Orange County, CA)<br><br>"Drawing from personal experience, John Mark speaks out hope and healing to the hurting and broken soul. I can t wait to pass this book along to others." -- Phil Wickham | Singer/Songwriter <br> <br> "Depression is an awful place to be and a worse place to live. Finding God s hope when there is nothing but drabness is a personal journey that John Mark Comer went on. My Name is Hope will enable people who are lost in darkness find the light Jesus wants to bring. Read hopefully." ---- Gerry Breshears, PhD | Professor of Theology, Western Seminary</i></i></p><h2>Art of War</h2><p>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

Born in Birkhamsted, England, he lived in Paris and Antibes before his death in April 1991.</p><h2>Nohow On: Company, Ill Seen Ill Said, Worstward Ho: Three Novels</h2><p>Now compiled in one volume, these three novels, which are among the most beautiful and disquieting of Samuel Beckett&#39;s later prose works, work together with the powerful resonance of his famous Three Novels: Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable. In Company, a voice comes to &#34;one on his back in the dark&#34; and speaks to him. Ill Seen Ill Said focuses attention on an old woman in a cabin who is part of the objects, landscape, rhythms, and movements of an incomprehensible universe. And in Worstward Ho, Beckett explores a tentative, uncertain existence in a world devoid of rational meaning and purpose. Here is language pared down to its most expressive, confirming Beckett&#39;s position as one of the great writers of our time.</p><p>Beckett has few imitators these days, when story is all to most novelists, but he remains a writer of unquestionable stature. <i>Nohow On: Company, Ill Seen Ill Said, Worstward Ho: Three Novels</i> and its companion volume <i>Samuel Beckett: The Complete Short Prose, 1929-1989</i> assemble virtually all of Beckett's prose work outside his sequence of major novels: Molloy, <i>Malone Dies</i>, and <i>The Unnamable</i>.In Beckett's fiction, every other word serves to snap the reader back to consciousness. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s</h2><p>A magisterial, unprecedented overview of the clouded and turbulent years before World War II.<br><br>It was a decade dominated worldwide by the Great Depression, by unemployment and hardship; a time when human achievement was matched by pervasive fear; when the great neon metaphors of hope that rose up after World War I--Broadway, Piccadilly Circus, the Kurf�rstendamm, the Ginza--grew dim both literally and figuratively. It was a decade during which darkness often masqueraded as light--Hitler's abolition of unemployment in Germany; Stalin's plans for progress and social equality in Russia; Mussolini's "revival" of Italy--while governments established and maintained control through brutal physical repression and the more nsidious, lasting repressions of truth: sanctioned deception and relentless propaganda. It was a decade during which a diffuse economic and social crisis condensed into a massive political and military storm. <br><br>Focusing individually on each of the primary staging grounds for history during the 1930s--the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Japan, Russia and Spain--Piers Brendon traces the particular and diverse experiences of the decade. Political and economic circumstances form the framework of this breathtaking work of scholarship, but it is also the story of people: both of crucial figures--Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Roosevelt, Franco, Chiang Kai-Shek and Mussolini, to name a few--and of a secondary, but no less fascinating, cast of characters, including George Orwell, Leni Riefenstahl and Ernest Hemingway. Brendon vividly conjures the texture and tone of life in places as far-flung as Paris and Kyoto, Vienna and Shanghai, Magnitogorsk in the Ural Mountains and Norris in the Tennessee Valley. He depicts the circumstances of the Ukrainian famine and the American Dust Bowl, the Night of the Long Knives and the conquest of Ethiopia, the bombing of Guernica, the <i>Anschluss</i> and the great Soviet purges. He describes the clothes people wore, the food they ate, the books and newspapers they read, the work they did or lacked, the beliefs they held, the pleasures they enjoyed, the sufferings they endured. <br><br>The public sphere and the personal realm, the collective lives of nations and the details of individual lives--each element of the book contributes to its brilliant elucidation of the ways in which, during the 1930s, political power obscured knowledge, economic catastrophe darkened understanding and the foundation was laid for the most profound and far-reaching crisis of modern times.<br><br><b>The Dark Valley</b> is a revelation of the ten years that set the course for the remainder of the twentieth <br>century.</p><p>"Dark Valley" as a phrase was coined first by the Japanese to refer to the desperate years of chaotic depression that followed the 1929 slump. But, as Piers Brendon's epic history of the same name vividly demonstrates, it was apt to describe any of the world's leading nations of the time--the crippled, traumatized European powers, a moody, solitary U.S., Stalin's outcast Soviet Union, and volatile, upstart Japan--with varying degrees of severity and fascinatingly contrasting outcomes. With no dishonor to those who endured the unspeakable traumas of the First World War, reading Brendon's scholarly tome leaves little scope to argue with the assertion, made by Leon Blum, among others, that the economic crisis and its effects were as traumatic as the "war to end all wars." Worse was to come, for sure, but the events that led to the "chasm" of the Second World War still boggle the mind--from our safe distance it is difficult to comprehend that this actually came to pass, yet at the same time the whole era seems to be engulfed by a fatalistic air of inevitability. In many ways, the insane dance of rampant ideological forces and economic desperation unleashed across the sphere make for the more gripping history, and in Brendon's hands, the cast of thousands is skillfully evoked, while the facts are judiciously evaluated, in a rolling narrative through the tribulations of the era. This is first-class historical writing, but certainly not for the faint-hearted. <i>--Alisdair Bowles, Amazon.co.uk</i>"The story of the 1930s has been told many times, but Brendon succeeds magnificently in breathing fresh life into the narrative . . . His text is a delight to read, a literary triumph sparkling with moments of real humour and compassion, sombre where it needs to be. Brendon is a master of the swift pen portrait, the telling anecdote, the curious footnotes to history that tell us more than a page of dusty scholarship."<br> -- <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i><br><br>"Piers Brendon's long book has such brilliance and narrative power, and contains so much fascinating detail that reading it has all the excitement of novelty." <br>-- <i>Evening Standard</i><br><br>"Historians are seldom thought of as elegant stylists, let alone as comic writers of the first rank. Piers Brendon is both . . . [He has] an eye for the telling detail that puts most novelists to shame."<br>-- <i>Sunday Express</i><br><br>"Piers Brendon's book, let's say it at once, is a tour de force . . . The book could hardly be better."<br>-- <i>The Scotsman</i><br><br>"Lively, fascinating . . . In telling his tale of the Thirties, Brendon paints a vivid and vigorous canvas . . . His character sketches of the principal players are sharp, perceptive, and often very funny."<br>-- <i>The Observer</i><br><br>"Distinctive and enthralling . . . Brendon's sweep and range are breathtakingly global. His story takes in everything and everywhere that matters between the 20th century's two world wars, moving with knowledge, insight, and wit . . .

I loved reading about a rabbi solving crimes. When I went to temple while studying for my Bar Mitzvah, during the rabbi's sermons I'd try to imagine him catching the myriad murderers in Barnard's Crossing; somehow, he just wasn't quite Rabbi David Small. And it was more than just the Jewish protagonist that drew me to the writing of Harry Kemelman; it was the spirit with which he told the story. When I came to Ballantine, I was so happy to be able to work on these terrific books. Unfortunately, Mr. Kemelman passed away shortly after THAT DAY THE RABBI LEFT TOWN was published. There may be no more new Rabbi David Small mysteries coming, but that won't prevent me from revisiting an old friend, time and time again.<br><br>Mark Rifkin, Managing EditorialKemelman's 1964 mystery launched the Rabbi David Small series and snagged an Edgar for best first novel. The plot finds the rabbi investigating the murder of a nanny no more than a stone's throw from his synagogue.

When his cousin, Aelmarkin, tries to prove that Kyrtian is unfit to run his estate, the plan backfires, and soon Kyrtian, who doesn't share the venal, greedy nature of his cousin, finds himself with more power than he ever wanted.<br><br>Like his father before him, Kyrtian has always treated the humans on his estate like servants, instead of enslaving them as other elvenlords do. His father's legacy also leads Kyrtian to learn ancient military skills long since lost to elvenkind through the carelessness of the elvenlords. Kyrtian's rediscovered knowledge piques the interest of the current elvenlords, and soon Kyrtian finds himself appointed the new commander of the army, to the relief of his ruling peers.<br><br>For the sons of the most powerful elvenlords, the Young Lords, have rebelled against their fathers and are waging war.

Since her first SF novels were published in the 1940s, her adventure SF has enthralled readers young and old. With series such as<i> Time Traders, Solar Queen, Forerunner, Beast Master, Crosstime, </i>and <i>Janus</i>, as well as many stand-alone novels, her tales of action and adventure throughout the galaxy have drawn countless readers to science fiction. <br><br>Her fantasy, including the best-selling <i>Witch World</i> series, her "Magic" series, and many other unrelated novels, has been popular with readers for decades. Lauded as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, she is the recipient of a Life Achievement Award from the World Fantasy Convention. Not only have her books been enormously popular; she also has inspired several generations of SF and fantasy writers, especially many talented women writers who have followed in her footsteps. In the past two decades she has worked with other writers on a number of novels. Most notable among these are collaborations with Mercedes Lackey, the <i>Halfblood Chronicles,</i> as well as collaborations with A.C. Crispin (in the <i>Witch World</i> series) and Sherwood Smith (in the <i>Time Traders </i>and <i>Solar Queen </i>series). An Ohio native, Ms. Norton lived for a number of years in Winter Park, Florida, and now makes her home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where she continues to write, and presides over High Hallack, a writers' resource and retreat.<br><br>Mercedes Lackey began writing fiction while working for American Airlines. In addition to her many novels, she has written lyrics for and recorded several albums of fiction folk songs, which have been distributed through Firebird Arts &amp; Music. Lackey's longest-running series, beginning with A<i>rrows of the Queen</i>, details the adventures of the Heralds of Valdemar. Lackey's other series include <i>Bardic Voices; the Elementals; the Halfblood Chronicles</i> (first volume: <i>The Elvenbane</i>);<i> Elves on the Road</i>, which includes Tor's <i>Burning Water</i> and its 0sequels; and the <i>Obsidian Trilogy</i>, also published by Tor, which begins with T<i>he Outstretched Shadow.</i><br><br>Lackey often teams up with both her fellow masters of fantasy, such as Andre Norton and Anne McCaffrey, and talented newer writers Rosemary Edghill. Married to artist and sometime co-author Larry Dixon, Lackey, who was born in Chicago, lives near Tulsa, Oklahoma. <br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>V'kel Aelmarkin er-Lord Tornal smiled down at the slave who rested her pale-tressed head on his knee. She was his current personal favorite, a young human female nestled trustingly against his leg. Her thin, fine-boned face and porcelain complexion pleased him with their flawless symmetry and perfection. She returned his smile shyly, yet with a touch of the coquette, her round, blue eyes reflecting her callow, unsophisticated nature. No rebellious thoughts dwelling in <i>that</i> narrow skull--in fact, he would be surprised if she managed to conjure up more than one or two thoughts of any kind in an average day! Her pedigree was immaculate, out of a long line of carefully chosen slaves famed for their beauty and delicacy to be nothing more complicated than any other ornamental object.<br>He sighed with contentment, and smoothed the pale gold, silken hair away from her brow with a gentle caress. She was exquisite; lovely, eager to please, pliant, graceful, innocent and incredibly easy to manipulate. Exactly the sort of slave that gave him the most pleasure. He carefully cultivated that innocence, and none of his other slaves would dare his wrath by spoiling that naivete. No tales of floggings or more extreme punishments, no harem-stories of his other "favorites" and what had become of them--nothing to hint that he had aspects she had never experienced. So far as she was concerned, he was the gentle, loving, ever-kind master that she believed him to be.<br>He turned his attention back to his most important guest. "There, you see?" he said, gesturing expansively to the hall before them and its raucous occupants. "Did I not promise you would be far more amused here than in dancing attendance on all the dull, hopeful maidens at your father's fete?"<br>Elvenlord Aelmarkin did not possess enough magic to create a fanciful illusion in his Great Hall, so the luxurious surroundings here were all quite real; guests at his entertainments would always find themselves in the same opulent room that they had graced at the last entertainment, rather than a new and exotic setting vastly different from their last. He made up for the lack of novel surroundings by the lavishness of his entertaining, which had begun to earn him something of a reputation.<br>Take this room, for example: fortunately it had been beautifully constructed in the first place, and he had only needed to embellish it when it came into his possession. The north and south walls were mostly of glass--northwards lay a natural lake, artfully landscaped, and southwards were the pleasure-gardens. The east and west walls, paneled in wood bleached to silver, held silver-rimmed doors that led to the rest of the manor. The ceiling with its bleached-wood beams from which hung great silver fantasies of lights, crystals, tiny glass sculptures and silver filigree, also boasted vast transparent skylights; just now the reflection of the myriad lights made it impossible to see anything of the outside world, but later, when the lights were dimmed, the stars would shine impassively down on the celebrants. The black carpet of the floor was kind to the bare feet of the slaves, but Aelmarkin had selected black carpeting largely because it was easy to clean after one of his entertainments and was far more forgiving a surface for a drunken reveler to fall on than marble or wood. The east and west walls were hung with silver draperies, and the silver dining-couches were upholstered in black to match the carpet. Between each couch and the next stood an enormous silver censer, from which came sensuous and intoxicating incense-smokes. Silver tables stood before each couch, and the guests provided the only touch of color in the room. The couches themselves each held two occupants, an invited guest and a companion of his (or her) choosing--either a fellow guest or one of Aelmarkin's harem-slaves dressed in silver gossamer and matching silver collar. Picturesque wine-slaves, dressed in abbreviated silver tunics, stood at each couch with their silver pitchers, and more slaves dressed in silver tunics and gossamer skirts or trews served the guests with plates of dainties. Enough wine had been drunk by this time that the guests were starting to raise their voices in less-than-delicate jests, and lose what few inhibitions they had when they arrived here.<br>V'sher Tennith er-Lord Kalumel raised one long, silver eyebrow sardonically as he surveyed the occupants of the dining couches before and below him. "I must admit," he drawled, "that seeing Varcaleme making a fool of himself is far more entertaining than fending off would-be brides and their anxious fathers."<br>Aelmarkin laughed and continued to caress the platinum tresses of his slave, chosen out of all the possible candidates presented to him, because she most resembled a delicate Elven maiden. He dressed her like an elven girl, too, in flowing gowns of delicate pastel silks with huge, butterfly sleeves and long embroidered trains, ordering her attendants to weave strings of pearls in her silver-blond hair--and to arrange her hair so that it covered the round tips of her ears. So long as one didn't look too deeply into her eyes, the illusion was complete; and he <i>could</i> use his magic to change her blue eyes to Elven-green if he chose. Her name had been "Kindre" until he ordered it changed to the Elven "Synterrathe."<br>The aforementioned Varcaleme was chasing one of the wine-girls around his couch; the flower-wreath she had bound around his brows had slipped sideways and was obscuring one eye, and the fact that he had drunk most of the wine in her now-empty flask was not aiding his ability to catch her. She had cast one look at her master when she began eluding those clutching hands, to see if he objected to her evasions; he had nodded slightly, and she needed no further encouragement to keep dodging his advances. Varcaleme's couch-companion, one of his personal concubines, a tall, dark-haired wench gowned in brilliant emerald that matched the beryl of her controlling collar, seemed relieved that she no longer had to entertain him, and was nibbling on spiced fruit, wearing a bored, but wary, expression.<br>Now the rest of the guests had taken an interest in the proceedings, calling out encouragement to Varcaleme or the slave, taking bets on whether or not he would catch her, as she dodged his outstretched hands and outpaced his stumbling feet. Most of Aelmarkin's guests were male, with a scant pair of Elven ladies. One of the ladies, clad in pearly silks that revealed scarcely less than the slaves' costumes, had brought her own couch-companion, a muscle-bound human gladiator; the other Elven lady, swathed from nape to ankle in skin-tight black satin, had come with another of the Elvenlords--who was <i>not</i> her affianced. Of the remaining twenty guests, half had brought their own concubines, and half had made a selection from the slaves offered to them by Aelmarkin.<br>All of the Elvenlords present, with the exception of Aelmarkin and the lady who had brought her own male concubine, were the sons of ruling Elvenlords--but had <i>not</i> joined the Young Lords' Rebellion. Most of them saw themselves as losing far more than they would gain by rebelling, and the rest were cynically hoping for the rebellion to eliminate their fathers for them.<br>Aelmarkin and V'dann Triana Lord Falcion--who, despite being female, was Lord of the Falcion holdings in her own right, and thus (it recently had been ruled) was entitled to the title of Lord rather than Lady or er-Lord--were the only Elvenlords in the room with their own estates and property. Aelmarkin, however, was hardly a Great Lord--his property was a fraction of the size of any of those with real power; most of his wealth came from the sale of the exquisitely bred and trained concubines who were literally worth their weight in gems. That gave him a certain status, but no real power. As for Triana, her standing had plummeted after her involvement in the debacle of the Second Wizard War, and she was no longer a desirable ally to anyone on the Great Council. She generally kept to herself on her own estate. He suspected that she was biding her time, waiting to see which way the wind blew in the Young Lords' Uprising, before she tried to worm her way back into the good graces of the powerful.<br>As a party guest, however, she was still of value; an acid wit and a reputation for depravity gave her all the fascination of a captivating serpent, and people enjoyed seeing what she would say or do next. Any time Aelmarkin invited her to one of his entertainments, he knew he would have full participation, and her own parties continued to be extremely popular among the younger sons, those who did not possess great power, and those who did not have a Council seat.<br>Aelmarkin was by no means as certain as the Great Lords that Triana would remain out of power for the foreseeable future. She was clever, resourceful, and learned from her mistakes. The Wizard Wars and the Rebellion were changing everything; it was always possible that Triana would prove to be a potent ally at some point. It was even possible that she would somehow claw her way to power entirely on her own. The extent of her boldness was demonstrated in her dress tonight; gowned in transparent silks like a concubine, she knew very well that however tempting she might be, there was no one here with sufficient power to dare touch her without her consent--and so she taunted them with her very appearance.<br>Besides, she had no scruples to speak of; he liked that in a woman--provided he didn't have to marry her.<br>"Have you heard anything more from the Council about your petition?" Triana called to him from across the room with a half smile. Her gladiator offered her a choice tidbit with a servile gesture; she allowed him to feed it to her, nibbling at it with white, sharp teeth. He was new to Aelmarkin, but that was hardly surprising; Triana went through male slaves at an astonishing rate.<br>He concealed a wince; Triana had a vested interest in the outcome of that petition, and it was one quite opposite to his. She <i>would</i> bring up the subject; he'd cherished the notion, when he'd scheduled this entertainment, that it might be a victory celebration. Since it wasn't, he had hoped no one would bring up the subject.<br>"They denied it," he said, trying to sound as if he didn't care about the outcome, even though his defeat ate at him.<br>Triana made a little pout of sympathy, and Tennith turned his head to gaze at Aelmarkin with astonishment. "No, really? I should have thought that your cousin had proved himself mentally unbalanced a hundred times over by now!"<br>About half of the guests looked puzzled; they didn't know who Aelmarkin's cousin was and he really didn't wish to enlighten them.<br>"Really!" chimed in another, sending away a server with a flick of an impatient hand, "Your cousin is quite a piece of work, Aelmarkin. Playing soldier with human slaves as if he was still an infant playing with toys! It's ridiculous! If he was going to have an obsession, it at least ought to be a dignified obsession!"<br>"Oh, I don't know," purred Triana, running her finger along the arm of her gladiator. "Some of us <i>like</i> to play with soldiers." The slave blushed from the top of his head to well past his waist.<br>"On what grounds did they deny you?" Tennith asked, and Aelmarkin wondered if he detected a certain malicious enjoyment in Tennith's tone. Tennith might not be a lord in his own right, but he outranked Aelmarkin, and he wasn't above flaunting that fact and embarrassing Aelmarkin at the same time.<br>But Tennith would find out for himself what the Council had said if he simply bothered to ask his father. Aelmarkin's best protection lay in pretending the decision meant very little to him. "They did a very tiresome thing; they had the production records from the estate for the last fifty years brought out, and nothing there shows that cousin Kyrtian is neglecting his estate or his duties. They decided that he isn't unbalanced, merely eccentric, and that eccentricity is hardly grounds for taking his inheritance and giving it to the next male heir."<br>"Next <i>male</i> heir?" Triana asked significantly, with a little frown. "Isn't his mother still alive? Wouldn't she be the appropriate heir even if he was disinherited on the grounds of insanity?" That was Triana's interest; anything that barred another female from inheriting could eventually be used against her.<br>"His mother is not <i>my</i> sister," Aelmarkin replied. "She's not the next heir of blood-descent, as you so clearly were for clan Falcion. If Kyrtian were removed, the estate would come to me, naturally and legally."<br>"She's probably the one running things, then," Tennith pointed out. "If she doesn't want to be sent back to live in her father's household, she has to make it look as if your cousin is competent."<br>"That may be, but I've no hope of proving it," Aelmarkin growled, wishing that Lady Lydiell had resembled the child at his feet rather than the clever creature she was. He recalled his intended pose, and forced a laugh. "Well, I suppose the Council had to rule the way that they did. Lord Jaspireth told me rather tartly that if fitness to hold title and property was to be judged on the basis of unusual hobbies, half the Council would lose their seats."<br>"Half?" Tennith laughed. "More like three-quarters! Looked at in that light, it's obvious you are a victim of necessity."<br>Aelmarkin signaled to his wench to refill his goblet, and sipped at the vintage with deliberation. "Much as I would like to see the lands of my clan administered properly, I suspect they will come to me in time, anyway. Kyrtian shows no sign of marrying, which in itself ought to prove his unfitness, and it's entirely possible he'll manage to break his neck, or do something equally foolish to himself, as he careens around the countryside."<br>"Break his neck?" queried the second lady, looking puzzled, as did her escort. "I'm afraid I'm rather lost, Aelmarkin. I don't know anything about your cousin. Who is he? Is he doing something dangerous?"<br>That triggered laughter among some of the others, who were more familiar with Aelmarkin's cousin than she was. Triana took pity on her--probably because the lady's escort was neither clever nor outstandingly handsome--and explained.<br>"We've been discussing Kyrtian V'dyll Lord Prastaran," Triana said, giving Aelmarkin's cousin his full name and title. "Surely you've heard something about him?"<br>The lady shook her head. "Not really," she confessed, then realized that Triana was patronizing her, and put on a cool air as she tried to save the situation. "But I don't pay much attention to the provincials."<br>Aelmarkin snorted. "He's certainly <i>provincial</i>, I'll grant you that, Lady Brynnire. He never leaves the estate unless he absolutely has to. He <i>could</i> get a seat on the Great Council if he only worked at it, but he won't even try! Instead, he spends all of his time collecting books and studying--of all the nonsensical subjects--military tactics!"<br>"Military tactics!" Triana erupted in peals of laughter. "Oh, Aelmarkin, even if he is serious and not seriously unbalanced, just who does he think he's going to <i>use</i> military tactics on? Everyone knows the humans and the half-bloods don't have <i>real</i> armies! They don't fight proper battles! And as for the Young Lords--"<br>She stopped, because it was entirely possible that this was a touchy subject for some of Aelmarkin's other guests. But Tennith, whose father was highly placed in the Great Council and thus was the highest-ranked Elvenlord present, finished her sentence for her.<br>"The Young Lords are a disorganized pack of rabble," he said loftily. "Once a solution is found that negates their ability to nullify magic, they'...</p><h2>Age of the Democratic Revolution, Vol. 1: The Challenge</h2><p><p>For the Western world as a whole, the period from about 1760 to 1800 was the great revolutionary era in which the outlines of the modern democratic state came into being.

Yet two years later, the country had ceased to exist, and devastating local wars were being waged to create new states. Between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the start of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in March 1992, the country moved toward disintegration at astonishing speed.</p><br><p>The collapse of Yugoslavia into nationalist regimes led not only to horrendous cruelty and destruction, but also to a crisis of Western security regimes. Coming at the height of euphoria over the end of the cold war and the promise of a "new world order," the conflict presented Western governments and the international community with an unwelcome and unexpected set of tasks. Their initial assessment that the conflict was of little strategic significance or national interest could not be sustained in light of its consequences. By 1994 the conflict had emerged as the most challenging threat to existing norms and institutions that Western leaders faced. And by the end of 1994, more than three years after the international community explicitly intervened to mediate the conflict, there had been no progress on any of the issues raised by the country's dissolution.</p><br><p>In this book, Susan Woodward explains what happened to Yugoslavia and what can be learned from the response of outsiders to its crisis. She argues that focusing on ancient ethnic hatreds and military aggression was a way to avoid the problem and misunderstood nationalism in post-communist states. The real origin of the Yugoslav conflict, Woodward explains, is the disintegration of governmental authority and the breakdown of a political and civil order, a process that occurred over a prolonged period. The Yugoslav conflict is inseparable from international change and interdependence, and it is not confined to the Balkans but is part of a more widespread phenomenon of political disintegration.</p><br><p>Woodward's analysis is based on her first-hand experience before the country's collapse and then during the later stages of the Bosnian war as a member of the UN operation sent to monitor cease-fires and provide humanitarian assistance. She argues that Western action not only failed to prevent the spread of violence or to negotiate peace, but actually exacerbated the conflict. Woodward attempts to explain why these challenges will not cease or the Yugoslav conflicts end until the actual causes of the conflict, the goals of combatants, and the fundamental issues they pose for international order are better understood and addressed.</p><br></p><p>Explains what happened to Yugoslavia and what can be learned from the response of outsiders to its crisis.

In the course of doing so, they became wealthy beyond any measure&#x2013;&#x2013;and to sustain their power, they lied, bribed, wheedled, and, when necessary, arranged for obstacles, both human and legal, to disappear. Their names were Collis Huntington, Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, and Mark Hopkins, and they were known as &#x201c;The Big Four&#x201d; or &#x201c;The Associates.&#x201d; Their drive for money&#x2013;&#x2013;nothing more, nothing less&#x2013;&#x2013;was epic. Their legacy is a university, public gardens, museums, mansions, banks, and libraries&#x2013;&#x2013;and to a large degree California itself, a state that even today owes its aura of &#x201c;can-do&#x201d; and limitless possibilities to <em>The Associates</em>.</p><p>Richard Rayner is the author of two works of nonfiction and five novels. His work appears in The New Yorker and other publications. He lives in Los Angeles, California.Novelist and nonfiction author Rayner (The Devil's Wind) provides a first-rate look at the little-known story behind the creation of America's first continental railroad&#x2014;the story of Collis Huntington, Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins and Leland Stanford, founder of the university that bears his name. The associates were unscrupulous, savvy profiteers, whose motives were driven solely by a lust for riches and whose success usually came at the expense of others. After usurping engineer Theodore Judah's campaign to connect the Atlantic with the Pacific, the foursome capitalized on anti-Chinese sentiment, hiring desperate Chinese to do hazardous work in inhumane conditions for substandard wages. They later sanctioned murder yet successfully painted themselves as philanthropists thanks to the journalists and historians in their pockets. Amid a story of greed and ruthlessness, Rayner offers a fascinating glimpse into the growth of the U.S., illustrating how these determined if ruthless men revolutionized transportation and greatly influenced the expansion of California. The author claims their business acumen defined the nature of the modern corporation, and their legacies live on in a library, a university, art galleries and museums. Entertaining and well written, Rayner's book will appeal to readers interested in history as well as business. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until Power, feminist art has been conspicuously absent from standard academic narratives. . . . Now, no critic or historian, conservative or not, can argue that feminist art is insignificant.&#34;--Elizabeth Hess, Village Voice. 270 illustrations, 118 in full color.</p><p>Available in paperback for the first time, this landmark volume is the only comprehensive history of American feminist art available. Exhaustively researched, this book is encyclopedic in its documentation of the feminist art movement, which began more than 25 years ago in the United States, and that ultimately transformed the art world. The editors have brought together 18 influential art historians, critics, and artists to explore every aspect of feminist art. There are more than 270 illustrations (118 in full color) that feature the work of women painters, sculptors, photographers, and performance artists, and a fold-out, illustrated timeline presenting a selective chronology of important events in and surrounding the movement, from its earliest roots in the 1940s to the mid-1990s.Dead white male George Santayana finds himself quoted more than once in this comprehensive record of feminist art and politics since the '70s. Painfully aware that feminism as an idea has arisen periodically since the Middle Ages but has until now never managed to last for more than a generation, the authors hope that, armed with a knowledge of feminist ``herstory,'' future artists will expand on rather than repeat the work of their predecessors. Representing a wide spectrum of feminist artists and thinkers, the 18 contributors to this impressive historical reference book include prominent women such as art historians Linda Nochlin and Arlene Raven and painter Miriam Schapiro. The book, edited by Broude and Garrard (both Art History/American Univ.), covers both art and politics, discussing such internationally famous projects as the CalArts student installation Womanhouse, as well as the contemporary activist groups WAC (the Women's Action Coalition) and the Guerrilla Girls. The authors analyze art ranging from Judy Chicago's ``central core'' imagery to lesbian performance pieces, ``great goddess'' imagery, and the pattern and decoration movement. (Le Corbusier once stated, ``There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art at the bottom, human form at the top. Because we are men.'') While the work represented here varies greatly in content and quality, all of it stems from what the artists often describe as ``coming to consciousness'' about their oppressed condition. For some artists this seems to have been a powerful, almost ``born again'' experience; for others it was a gradual reorientation of perspective. As this book makes clear, the collective impact of feminist thought on contemporary society has also been significant- -in the early '70s, young art historians studying past women artists discovered that slides of their work did not even exist. However, discrimination still exists: As the Guerrilla Girls' posters reproduced here show, despite a roughly equal gender mix in art schools over the past 20 years, most major galleries still show mostly men. Essential reading for any woman in the arts. (245 illustrations, 118 in color) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Just as she meets and falls in love with the wildly inappropriate Joaqu�n Andieta, a lowly clerk who works for Jeremy, gold is discovered in the hills of northern California. By 1849, Chileans of every stripe have fallen prey to feverish dreams of wealth. Joaqu�n takes off for San Francisco to seek his fortune, and Eliza, pregnant with his child, decides to follow him. </p><p>As Eliza embarks on her perilous journey north in the hold of a ship and arrives in the rough-and-tumble world of San Francisco, she must navigate a society dominated by greedy men. But Eliza soon catches on with the help of her natural spirit and a good friend, the Chinese doctor Tao Chi&#x2019;en. What began as a search for love ends up as the conquest of personal freedom. </p><p>A marvel of storytelling, <em>Daughter of Fortune</em> confirms once again Isabel Allende's extraordinary gift for fiction and her place as one of the world's leading writers.</p></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, February 2000:</b> Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut, <i>The House of the Spirits</i>, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys' club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa. But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction, <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep. <blockquote> "You have English blood, like us," Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. "Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language." </blockquote> The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: "You, English? Don't get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine." And certainly Eliza's almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side. <p> As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for. Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chi'en's past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all in <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p><p>An orphan raised in Valparaiso, Chile, by a Victorian spinster and her rigid brother, vivacious young Eliza Sommers follows her lover to California during the Gold Rush of 1849.

California opens the door to a new life of freedom and independence for the young Chilean, and her search for her elusive lover gradually turns into another kind of journey. By the time she finally hears news of him, Eliza must decide who her true love really is.</p></p><h2>Daily Meditations for Calming Your Anxious Mind</h2><p><p>Trying to control your anxious thoughts can backfire, making them more prevalent, not less.

At first, she thought it was folly to consider a book on such a subject and it seems that her publishers thought so too. But the book became a historical, archaeological and political analysis of the country, as well as a conversation and an account of folklore, prophecy, and a record of landscape. The book also includes the author&#39;s views on religion, ethics, art, myth and gender. The book was completed as Yugoslavia was plunged into political turmoil, followed by invasion and four years of merciless civil and partisan warfare. It is being re-published half a century later during equally critical times for the people of the Balkans. Rebecca West is the author of nonfiction works such as &#34;The Meaning of Treason&#34; and &#34;A Train of Powder&#34;, and works of fiction including &#34;The Thinking Reed&#34;, &#34;The Fountain Overflows&#34; and &#34;The Birds Fall Down&#34;.</p><p>Part travelogue, part history, part love letter on a thousand-page scale, Rebecca West's <i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i> is a genre-bending masterwork written in elegant prose. But what makes it so unlikely to be confused with any other book of history, politics, or culture--with, in fact, any other book--is its unashamed depth of feeling: think <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> crossed with <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>. West visited Yugoslavia for the first time in 1936. What she saw there affected her so much that she had to return--partly, she writes, because it most resembled "the country I have always seen between sleeping and waking," and partly because "it was like picking up a strand of wool that would lead me out of a labyrinth in which, to my surprise, I had found myself immured." <i>Black Lamb</i> is the chronicle of her travels, but above all it is West following that strand of wool: through countless historical digressions; through winding narratives of battles, slavery, and assassinations; through Shakespeare and Augustine and into the very heart of human frailty. <p> West wrote on the brink of World War II, when she was "already convinced of the inevitability of the second Anglo-German war." The resulting book is colored by that impending conflict, and by West's search for universals amid the complex particulars of Balkan history. In the end, she saw the region's doom--and our own--in a double infatuation with sacrifice, the "black lamb and grey falcon" of her title. It's the story of Abraham and Isaac without the last-minute reprieve: those who hate are all too ready to martyr the innocent in order to procure their own advantage, and the innocent themselves are all too eager to be martyred. To West, in 1941, "the whole world is a vast Kossovo, an abominable blood-logged plain." Unfortunately, little has happened since then to prove her wrong. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><p>'Impossible to put down, both timeless and of its time - a travel book and epic narrative history brimming with passion, anger, scholarship and intuition, hatred and love.' <i>Observer</i></p><p>First published in 1942, Rebecca West's epic masterpiece is widely regarded as the most illuminating book to have been written on what was once Yugoslavia, essential for anyone attempting to understand the enigmatic history of the Balkan states.</p><p>'Such incandescent writing - you find yourself wanting to mark every sentence in order to go back and relish it again.' Brian Eno</p><p>'One of the supreme masterpieces of the twentieth century . . . As a book about Yugoslavia it's a kind of metaphysical <i>Lonely Planet </i>that never requires updating . . . this is history as it might have been written by Ryszard Kapuscinski or Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez'. Geoff Dyer, from his introduction</p><p>'It is hard to convey the flavour of a book so rich in observation, history, philosophy, political ideas and ironic humour. West is full of digressions which are extraordinary, but never boring.' <i>The Times</i></p><p>'The sheer quality and depth of the writing make it one of the great books of the century.' <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p></p><h2>The Passion</h2><p>Passion consumes Henri, a chef with Napoleon&#39;s army, and Villanelle, who has lost her heart to a married noblewoman, until the two meet at the gates of Moscow and form a bond based on bitter loss</p><p>In 1985 Jeanette Winterson won the Whitbread Award for best first fiction for the semi-autobiographical <i>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit,</i> an often wry exploration of lesbian possibility bumping up against evangelical fanaticism. She was 25. Two years later, <i>The Passion,</i> her third novel, appeared, the fantastical tale of Henri--Napoleon's cook--and Villanelle, a Venetian gondolier's daughter who has webbed feet (previously an all-male attribute), works as a croupier, picks pockets, cross-dresses, and literally loses her heart to a beautiful woman. Written in a lyrical and jolting combination of fairy tale diction and rhythm and the staccato, the book would be a risky proposition in lesser hands. Winterson has said that she wanted to look at people's need to worship and examine what happens to young men in militaristic societies. The question was, how to do so without being polemical and didactic? Only she could have come up with such an exquisite answer. In the end, Henri, incarcerated on an island of madmen, becomes aware that his passion, "even though she could never return it, showed me the difference between inventing a lover and falling in love. The one is about you, the other about someone else.""An explosively imaginative writer." &#x2014; <i>The London Free Press<br><br></i>"A historical novel quite different from any other...written with a living passion, an eyewitness immediacy.... Winterson is a master of her material, a writer in whom great talent deeply abides." &#x2014; <i> Vanity Fair<br><br></i>"Recalls Garcia Marquez.... Magical touches dance like highlights over the brilliance of this fairy tale about passion, gambling, madness, and androgynous ecstasy." &#x2014; Edmund White <br> <br>"The overwhelming impression of her work is one of remarkable self-confidence, and she evidently thrives on risk....

Into the feverous landscape of the city, he introduces the Cuban mayor, the black police chief, a wanna-go-muckraking young journalist and his Yale-marinated editor; an Anglo sex-addiction psychiatrist and his Latina nurse by day, loin lock by night-until lately, the love of Nestor's life; a refined, and oh-so-light-skinned young woman from Haiti and her Creole-spouting, black-gang-banger-stylin' little brother; a billionaire porn addict, crack dealers in the 'hoods, "de-skilled" conceptual artists at the Miami Art Basel Fair, "spectators" at the annual Biscayne Bay regatta looking only for that night's orgy, yenta-heavy ex-New Yorkers at an "Active Adult" condo, and a nest of shady Russians. Based on the same sort of detailed, on-scene, high-energy reporting that powered Tom Wolfe's previous bestselling novels, BACK TO BLOOD is another brilliant, spot-on, scrupulous, and often hilarious reckoning with our times.</p><p>A writer like Tom Wolfe probably shouldn&#x2019;t have to stage a comeback, but there will doubtless be reviewers of his new novel, <em>Back to Blood</em>, who describe it that way. In Wolfe's career of great books, his last novel, published in 2004, was considered by many to be a stumble--but <em>Back to Blood</em> is a return to form, a work that solidifies Wolfe&#x2019;s stature as one of the best. Using his incisive journalistic skills, his flair for the cinematic moment, and his laugh-out-loud sense of humor, Wolfe takes the disparate types in and around Miami to create a tapestry of memorable scenes and characters. The result is entertaining, revealing, and perhaps even bigger than the sum of its parts. This is a book that will do for Miami what Wolfe's mega-hit <em>The Bonfire of the Vanities </em> did for New York. --<em>Chris Schluep</em>Tom Wolfe is the author of more than a dozen books, among them such bestselling contemporary classics as <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, The Right Stuff, The Bonfire of the Vanities, A Man in Full, </em>and <em>I Am Charlotte Simmons. </em>A native of Richmond, Virginia, he earned his B.A. at Washington and Lee University and a Ph.D. in American studies at Yale.

It is also a tale about the blurring of racial boundaries: great-grandmother Elisabeth notices an unmistakable "bleaching of the line" as first her daughter Suzette, then her granddaughter Philomene, and finally her great-granddaughter Emily choose (or are forcibly persuaded) to bear the illegitimate offspring of the area's white French planters. In many cases these children are loved by their fathers, and their paternity is widely acknowledged. However, neither state law nor local custom allows them to inherit wealth or property, a fact that gives <i>Cane River</i> much of its narrative drive. <p> The author makes it clear exactly where these prohibitions came from. Plantation society was rigidly hierarchical, after all, particularly on the heels of the Civil War and the economic hardships that came with Reconstruction. The only permissible path upward for hard-working, ambitious African Americans was indirect. A meteoric rise, or too obvious an appearance of prosperity, would be swiftly punished. To enable the slow but steady advance of their clan, the black women of <i>Cane River</i> plot, plead, deceive, and manipulate their way through history, extracting crucial gifts of money and property along the way. In the wake of a visit from the 1880 census taker, the aged Elisabeth reflects on how far they had come. </p><blockquote> When the census taker looked at them, he saw colored first, asking questions like single or married, trying to introduce shame where there was none. He took what he saw and foolishly put those things down on a list for others to study. Could he even understand the pride in being able to say that Emily could read and write? They could ask whatever they wanted, but what he should have been marking in the book was family, and landholder, and educated, each generation gathering momentum, adding something special to the brew. </blockquote> In her introduction, Tademy explains that as a young woman, she failed to appreciate the love and reverence with which her mother and her four uncles spoke of their lively Grandma 'Tite (short for "Mademoiselle Petite"). She resented her great-grandmother's skin-color biases, which were as much a part of Tademy's memory as were her great-grandmother's trademark dance moves. But the old stories haunted the author, and armed with a couple of pages of history compiled by a distant Louisiana cousin, she began to piece together a genealogy. The result? Tademy eventually left her position as vice president of a Fortune 500 company and set to work on <i>Cane River</i>, in which she has deftly and movingly reconstructed the world of her ancestors. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Lalita Tademy lives in Menlo Park, California.</p><h2>The Clowns of God</h2><p>After the reigning Pope, Gregory XVII, claims to have received a private revelation, the Cardinals declare he must resign or be declared insane and whether Gregory is a mystic, a lunatic, or an ambitious fanatic remains in question</p><p>Morris West was one of the great storytellers of the twentieth century.

It contains millions of neurons - as many as you would find in the brain of a cat - and is home to the microbiome, an army of microbes that influences your mood, weight and immune system. In this groundbreaking book, Dr Mosley takes us on a revelatory journey through the gut, showing how junk food and overuse of antibiotics have wiped out many &#34;good&#34; gut bacteria, leading to a modern plague of allergies, food intolerances and obesity. Setting the record straight on everything from prebiotics to probiotics, fermented foods to fasting, Dr Mosley provides scientifically proven ways to control your appetite and boost your mood.

He is married with four children.The Clever Gut Diet Introduction<p></p> <br>Although this book has &#x201c;diet&#x201d; in its title, it is not really about losing weight. That may well happen, if you eat the foods and do the things I recommend, but that&#x2019;s not its primary purpose. The Clever Gut Diet is a &#x201c;diet&#x201d; in the same way you might talk about being on a vegetarian diet or a Mediterranean diet. It&#x2019;s not about calories or restriction; it&#x2019;s about the sort of food and lifestyle changes you should make if you have gut problems, or simply want to keep yours in good condition.<br> <br>The gut is not a glamorous organ. When I was at medical school many of my fellow students wanted to study the brain, as neurosurgeons, or become cardiologists, experts in the heart. I never heard anyone say they wanted to dedicate their life to the gut. And yet it is extraordinary&#x2014;a part of the body, hitherto relatively unexplored, with which I have recently become rather obsessed. Thanks to a huge amount of new research, probing the world within our guts is changing our understanding of the way our bodies work.<br> <br>As well as extracting energy from our food, the gut accounts for most of our immune system and produces more than two dozen hormones that influence everything from our appetite to our mood.<br> <br>I also love the fact that, buried in our intestines, deep inside its tissue, is a very thin layer of brain. It&#x2019;s called the enteric system and it is made up of the same cells, neurons, which are found in the brain. There are over one hundred million neurons in the gut, as many as you would find in the brain of a cat. Except, instead of being in one big lump, like the brain on top of your neck, the neurons in your gut are spread out in a thin mesh that extends all the way from your throat to your rectum. This &#x201c;second brain&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t do much geometry or worry about tax returns, but it does orchestrate digestion and moderate gut pain.<br> <br>When we talk about having &#x201c;gut feelings&#x201d; or &#x201c;gut instincts&#x201d; we are reflecting the reality of how closely our guts and brains are entwined. In this book I am going to be talking a lot about the &#x201c;gut-brain axis&#x201d; and the new science that surrounds it.<br> <br>Your gut is a wonderful piece of engineering and I hope, after you have read this, you will share my enthusiasm for it. But in many ways the star of the digestive show is not actually part of the human body at all&#x2014;it is the 2 to 4 pounds of microbes that live in your gut and make up the microbiome.<br> <br>Until recently the world of the microbiome was a dark, dank, and private one. Down there live creatures that have never seen the light of day, more than fifty trillion of them, at least one thousand different species, a richer diversity of life than you would find in a rain forest.<br> <br>As is often the case with new scientific discoveries, a lot of genuine research has been misinterpreted and findings have been exaggerated. And, just as these microbes were previously ignored, now they are in danger of being seriously overhyped. Recent research shows that we are not &#x201c;90 percent bacteria&#x201d; and &#x201c;10 percent human,&#x201d; as many books and articles have claimed, but more like 50:50.1<br> <br>In fact, according to one of the researchers who helped explode this myth, the proportions are so similar that &#x201c;each defecation may flip the ratio to favor human cells over bacteria.&#x201d;<br> <br>More important, while there are foods that will help your microbiome thrive (and that&#x2019;s why this book contains recipes), few of the products that are sold on this basis have credible science behind them. When it comes to prebiotics, probiotics, and supplements, I will show you what works and what doesn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Our widespread ignorance about the microbiome arises from the fact that, until quite recently, its inhabitants, microbes, were impossible to study. We knew they helped protect the gut from dangerous invaders, that they synthesized a few vitamins, and that they gobbled up fiber that our bodies couldn&#x2019;t digest.<br> <br>Now we know they do far more than that:<br> <br>1. They help regulate our body weight. As we&#x2019;ll see in later chapters, the microbes in your gut can decide how much energy your body extracts from the food you eat; they control hunger signals, they help decide which foods you crave, and they determine how much your blood sugar spikes in response to a meal. Can your microbiome make you fat? It certainly can. Can you change your microbiome so it works with you rather than against you? You certainly can, and I will show you how.<br> <br>2. The microbiome not only protects our guts from invaders, it teaches and regulates our entire immune system. Over the last half century we have seen a massive rise in allergic diseases, such as asthma and eczema, caused by an overactive immune system. We have also seen a huge surge in autoimmune diseases, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to type 1 diabetes, which again are primarily caused by an immune system that has gotten out of control. I will show you how changing the mix of bacteria in your gut can reduce the impact of these diseases.<br> <br>3. The microbiome takes the bits of food our body can&#x2019;t digest and converts them into a wide range of hormones and chemicals. These, it seems, can control our mood, as well as our appetite and general health. Changing your biome may reduce anxiety and lessen depression.<br> <br>The tragedy is that, in our ignorance, we have been laying waste to our microbiome and its population of microbes, or &#x201c;Old Friends.&#x201d; They&#x2019;ve been given that name because they have evolved with us over millions of years, and also because so many of them are essential to our health. Just as we have ravaged the rain forests and consigned numerous animal species to oblivion, so we have decimated the populations that live inside us. Fortunately we can help these Old Friends bounce back. I will show you how.<br> <br>I will also be looking into the latest treatments for a number of gut problems, ranging from gluten intolerance to irritable bowel syndrome. These are diseases that many people struggle with, in part because doctors are often bad at both diagnosing and treating them. They are frequently dismissed as &#x201c;psychosomatic&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, the product of anxiety or depression.<br> <br>The same used to be said of stomach ulcers. Also known as gastric ulcers, these are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach and small intestine.<br> <br>Back in 1994, when I made a television program about ulcers (which I unimaginatively called Ulcer Wars), they were common and considered incurable. It was widely believed that they were caused by stress, which made your stomach produce too much acid, and that was what did the damage. The standard medical advice was to eat bland food, change your stressful lifestyle, and take a drug to reduce acid production. If that didn&#x2019;t work, and it often didn&#x2019;t, you might find yourself in the hands of surgeons having parts of your stomach and small bowel removed.<br> <br>But in Perth, Western Australia, there were a couple of doctors who did not think that stress was the real cause of ulcers. They argued that most ulcers were the result of infection by a previously unknown bacterium that they had identified and named Helicobacter pylori.<br> <br>To make his point, in 1984 one of the scientists, Dr. Barry Marshall, brewed up a flask of Helicobacter and swallowed it. A few days later, as he smilingly told me, he started vomiting. He had himself endoscoped; a small tube was passed down his throat and into his stomach. Samples of his now inflamed stomach lining were removed. These showed that his stomach had been colonized by Helicobacter.<br> <br>Barry&#x2019;s wife, Adrienne, who worried that he would become seriously ill, insisted that he stop the experiment. So Barry took a handful of antibiotics, which he had previously shown could kill Helicobacter, and soon his stomach was back to normal.<br> <br>Ten years later, and despite extensive research showing that a short course of antibiotics could cure stomach ulcers, most of the experts I interviewed for my film dismissed Barry&#x2019;s work out of hand. One told me he refused to believe a major breakthrough could have come out of an &#x201c;academic backwater like Perth.&#x201d; A gut expert who reviewed my film in the British Medical Journal described it as &#x201c;one-sided and tendentious.&#x201d;<br> <br>Normally you make a documentary, it goes out, and that is that. Not with Ulcer Wars. I received tens of thousands of letters (these were the days before the internet or email) from people in terrible pain, who had not responded to standard treatments. I ended up sending out thousands of fact sheets, describing the science and Barry&#x2019;s antibiotics protocol.<br> <br>I still have some of the letters I got back, including one from a guy called Brian whose ulcer was not responding to standard treatment and who had been told to give up the high-powered job he loved and have most of his stomach removed. He took my fact sheet to his doctor, and begged for a course of antibiotics. His doctor reluctantly agreed and within a couple of weeks he was completely cured. He wrote to me regularly afterward to say he was still going strong.<br> <br>The tide slowly turned and I was delighted when Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work in 2005. Looking for and treating Helicobacter infection when people have gastric ulcers is now completely standard practice.<br> <br>The point I&#x2019;m making is not that antibiotics are the solution to everything. They aren&#x2019;t and their overuse has created other serious gut problems. Nor am I suggesting that stress doesn&#x2019;t matter. It does, and I will show you proven ways to de-stress.<br> <br>The point is that many diseases have been dismissed as psychosomatic simply because doctors haven&#x2019;t had the right tools to investigate them properly. In the 1930s asthma was treated by psychotherapy because of the mistaken belief that it was &#x201c;all in the mind.&#x201d; Autism and schizophrenia were once blamed on poor parenting.<br> <br>One reason I&#x2019;ve written this book is that I&#x2019;m convinced that many common gut conditions are better treated by a change in diet than by drugs or antidepressants.<br> <br>The initial chapters provide an overview of the gut, which I have written in the form of a journey through my own intestines. These chapters include not only what the gut does, but also what happens when it goes wrong.<br> <br>Chapter 3 introduces us to the wonderful world of the microbiome and some of the more influential tribes that you will find down there.<br> <br>Subsequent chapters look at the unexpected ways in which our microbiome influences us, before moving on to scientifically tested ways to keep it in good shape. And finally there is a section of recipes from nutritional therapist Tanya Borowski and general practitioner Clare Bailey.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve learned a great deal that has surprised me, and gotten a lot of practical benefit from researching this book. I now eat a much wider range of foods, including fermented foods I&#x2019;d never tried before. I&#x2019;ve thoroughly enjoyed the journey. I hope you do, too.</p><h2>LIFE 70 Years of Extraordinary Photography: The Platinum Anniversary Collection</h2><p>Honoring seven decades of outstanding work, a superlative assemblage of photographic images offers unforgettable moments from the past seventy years, capturing each era&#39;s greatest celebrities, horrific battlefield sequences, and everyday American life.</p><p>The brainchild of Henry Luce, owner of Time and Fortune, Life magazine was formed in 1936 and quickly became one of the most influential publications of the 20th century. Its original mandate, in the words of Luce, was "to see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events," and as such it brought extraordinary images from around the world into American households. This collection, a 70-year retrospective, presents a history in photos, highlighting the most famous, moving and beautiful pictures from the magazine, including classics by Alfred Eisenstaedt, Dorothea Lange, Margaret Bourke-White, and Irving Penn. Divided into sections covering the presidency, Hollywood, war, science and nature, culture, sport and "fun," this volume packs in a huge assortment of subjects and emotions. Of particular interest is the chapter of "Photo Essays," a pioneering Life feature that revolutionized the field of photojournalism, capturing stories through image sequences and small blurbs; included are provocative stories such as the plight of German refugees in 1945, Heroin use in the '60s and Larry Burrows' intimate portrait of the Vietnam war, which has been called "the greatest photo essay ever made." In honor of its legacy, the Platinum Anniversary Collection closes with a short annex of every magazine cover from the magazine's long, illustrious life.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The November 23, 1936, first issue contained a sterling example (well sampled herein) by Margaret Bourke-White of what would become a <i>Life</i> staple, the photo-essay. The magazine really caught on when World War II began. At its 1940s-early 1960s acme, <i>Life</i> may have been read by one-third of all American households; the distinction of its photos ensured that many more would see its wares reproduced in books, exhibitions, and other media. This survey cherry-picks <i>Life</i>'s seven decades for chapters on the presidency, the photo-essay, Hollywood, war, science and nature, sports, "Our Culture, Our World," and people having fun. If many of the photographers' names are famous, several of the pictures are so well known that they have become icons of their times and events, such as "The Picture" (sailor kisses girl in Times Square on V-J Day). No matter how many times they are repackaged--indispensable images. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this explosive book, Peter Schweizer provides the riveting details of how the Reagan administration undermined the Soviet economy and its dwindling resource base while subverting the Kremlin's hold on its global empire. Using secret diplomacy, the administration dramatically reduced Soviet income while at the same time driving Moscow to expend an increasing amount of precious assets. On another level, the administration provided covert aid to indigenous forces in Poland and Afghanistan to roll back Soviet power. <p>The development and execution of these policies was limited to a few members of the Reagan inner circle. Based on exclusive interviews with key participants, including Caspar Weinberger, George Shultz, John Poindexter, Robert McFarlane, William Clark, and others, Victory chronicles the drama as it unfolded. From the secret trips of CIA director Bill Casey to National Security Council plans to damage the Soviet economy, the complete American strategy is revealed for the first time. Interviews with senior Soviet officials from the KGB, Politburo, and Communist Party Central Committee offer Kremlin perspectives on these American initiatives, and secret government documents-both Soviet and American-offer a conclusive paper trail on this world-turning period. </p><p>For the first time, read about the plan from several top-secret National Security Decision Directives (NSDDs) signed by President Reagan early in his administration: </p><p>NSDD-32, which stated that it was U.S. policy to "neutralize" Soviet power in Eastern Europe </p><p>NSDD-56, the first shot in the economic war that helped bankrupt the Kremlin </p><p>NSDD-75, which declared that it was U.S. strategy to attack Soviet weakness and "roll back" Soviet power </p><p>No singular event of policy pushed the Kremlin over the brink. The power of the Reagan administration's strategy was in its cumulative effect on the Soviet system. Learn why and how Ronald Reagan helped bring down the Soviet Union. </p><p>"Americans need evaluations of their country's Cold War strategy that go beyond sloganeering....

The author revived the idea after Onassis died in 1975. The Smyrna-born man, who was to become universally notorious as "Ari," started early to distort facts to suit himself, for instance updating his birthdate from 1900. As a youth, he was already a daunting competitor, making the money on which he built his fortune. Apparently, the driving forces in the Greek magnate's life were acquiring money and women. Dwelling on Onassis's intricate business deals and entanglements with the law, the author tells little more than is already well known about his subject's relationships with public figures. The writing is rather dull, showing diligent research but not the flair that could vivify Ari as a phenomenal character. There are, however, sufficient notes about his wives, children, Maria Callas and other mistresses to intrigue if not satisfy readers. Photos not seen by PW.

Court astrologer to Elizabeth I, he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy, divination and Hermetic philosophy. Dee considered all his activities to be different facets of the same quest for an understanding of the divine forms he saw as underlying the visible world, and which showed themselves as oracles--words of wisdom from angelic sources. Now best-selling author John Matthews and award-winning artists Wil Kinghan have transformed Dee's studies into <i>The Oracle of Dr. John Dee</i>. Drawing together the interrelated aspects of Dee's work, this oracle offers guidance on key life areas in your own quest or life journey. Based on Dee's own Golden Talisman (currently held in the British Museum), the oracle is governed by the Four Towers of the talisman on which the cards are laid, each representing one of four key divisions of life: health, love, work and intention. Each tower is ruled over by a mighty archangel, who brings the appropriate wisdom, understanding, healing or insight to the issue at hand, helping you to find the way through the storms of life offering strength, support and inspiration.</p><p> With The Oracle of Dr. John Dee, you can now gain unique insight and guidance for your life journey from one of the greatest visionaries of all time.</p></p><p>John Matthews has produced a number of successful divinatory systems and author numerous books on Arturian and Celtic myths as well as the study of Western Esoteric beliefs.</p><h2>The Case of Peter Pan, or the Impossibility of Children&#39;s Fiction (New Cultural Studies)</h2><p><p>Peter Pan, Jacqueline Rose contends, forces us to question what it is we are doing in the endless production and dissemination of children's fiction. In a preface, written for this edition, Rose considers some of Peter Pan's new guises and their implications. From Spielberg's Hook, to the lesbian production of the play at the London Drill Hall in 1991, to debates in the English House of Lords, to a newly claimed status as the icon of transvestite culture, Peter Pan continues to demonstrate its bizarre renewability as a cultural fetish of our times.</p></p><p>What is the meaning of Peter Pan -- not for J. M. Barrie, but for the thousands who have continued to purchase for children version after version of the story and who have faithfully attended the productions of the play? What does Peter Pan have to say about our conception of childhood, about how we understand the child's and our own relationship to language, sexuality, and death? What can Peter Pan tell us about the theatrical, literary, and educational institutions of which it is a part?<p>These are some of the questions this book attempts to answer. Shifting attention away from J. M. Barrie, the originator of Peter Pan, it asks instead what is the nature of our own desire or investment in this phenomenon of our culture. In the course of her investigation, Jacqueline Rose identifies behind Peter Pan a fantasy of childhood which she traces back through the history of children's fiction, forward to modern critical commentaries on children's writing, and into some of the most contemporary writers of books for children today.</p><p>Originally published in 1984, The Case of Peter Pan is now widely available in the United States for the first time. Peter Pan, Rose contends, forces us to question what it is we are doing in the endless production and dissemination of children's fiction. In a new introductory essay written especially for this edition, Rose considers some of Peter Pan's new guises and their implications. From Spielberg's Hook, to the lesbian production of the play at the London Drill Hall in 1991, to debates in the English House of Lords, to a newly claimed status as the icon of a transvestite culture, Peter Pan continues to demonstrate its bizarre renewability as a cultural fetishof our times.</p><p>"Rose's searching arguments are complex and concentrated. This is the book children's literature has needed for some time. It combines scholarly examination of primary sources with historical commentary, the social history of childhood and critical theory derived from psychoanalysis. . . . It is a challenge to critics to examine the whole range of cultural practices attached to stories for children."&#x2014;<i>London Review of Books</i></p><br><br><p>"Everyone interested in the way in which the balance of power between adult and child in our society is expressed in the books offered by the former to the latter should read Rose's study of Peter Pan."&#x2014;<i>Times Education Supplement</i></p></p><h2>Princess of the Silver Woods (Twelve Dancing Princesses)</h2><p><p>When Petunia, the youngest of King Gregor's twelve dancing daughters, is invited to visit an elderly friend in the neighboring country of Westfalin, she welcomes the change of scenery. But in order to reach Westfalin, Petunia must pass through a forest where strange two-legged wolves are rumored to exist. Wolves intent on redistributing the wealth of the noble citizens who have entered their territory. But the bandit-wolves prove more rakishly handsome than truly dangerous, and it's not until Petunia reaches her destination that she realizes the kindly grandmother she has been summoned to visit is really an enemy bent on restoring an age-old curse. </p><p>The stories of Red Riding Hood and Robin Hood get a twist as Petunia and her many sisters take on bandits, grannies, and the new King Under Stone to end their family curse once and for all.</p></p><p><p><b>JESSICA DAY GEORGE </b>is the author of <i>Princess of Glass </i>and <i>Princess of the Midnight Ball </i>as well as three novels in the Dragon Slippers series, and <i>Tuesdays at the Castle</i>.

Freese speaks to dozens of major corporations annually.Use People's Curiosity to Make the Sale<br><br>Excerpted from Secrets of Question-Based Selling by Thomas Freese � 2000<br><br>The newly hired salesperson, trying to rationalize his lack of production during the first month on the job, explains to his boss, "Sir, I can lead the 'horses' to water, but I can't always make 'em drink."<br><br>"Make 'em drink?" the sales manager sputters. "Making customers drink is not your job. Your job is to make them thirsty!"<br><br>The sales manager in this anecdote makes an interesting point. It's not a salesperson's job to make people buy. Rather, the salesperson's function is to uncover new opportunities, and then pique the prospect's interest, so they will want to know more about the products and services being offered.<br><br>In Question Based Selling, we want prospective customers to become curious. We want them to ask questions, and we want them to be "thirsty" for more information about the value we provide. But this requires a change in strategy. Rather than launching right into a litany of features and benefits, in an attempt to pique your prospect's interest, QBS recommends piquing the prospect's interest first in order to create new opportunities to uncover needs and present solutions. <br><br>If you want to engage new prospects in productive sales conversation, you essentially have two choices. You can be aggressive and try to force your way in, or you can make prospects curious enough to want more information about the value you provide-so they will invite you in. Not surprisingly, most of us would rather be invited in than to try and use brute force. <br><br>The Conversational Layering model (from chapter 6) shows us that curiosity is the key that unlocks the rest of the sales process. If a prospective buyer is not the least bit interested in who you are, or what you can do for them, then you will not get their time or attention. Fortunately, the opposite is true. As prospective buyers become more and more curious about how you can offer value, it becomes much easier to create new opportunities to sell. This is actually good news for salespeople because it simplifies the sales process. It also puts you in control of your own destiny. In other words, if you can make prospects curious, then you will have many more opportunities to establish credibility, build relationships, uncover needs, present solutions, and secure the commitments necessary to move forward with a sale. <br><br>Now, the question is, what makes people curious?<br><br>The Easiest Way to Make Someone Curious<br>There are lots of ways to make people curious. You can make someone curious by saying something that piques their interest. You can also leverage curiosity with provocative voice-mail messages or by sending intriguing emails. We will analyze each of these as the chapter unfolds, but for starters, let's begin by talking about the easiest way to pique someone's curiosity. <br><br>Making people curious doesn't have to be difficult. In fact, the easiest way to pique someone's curiosity is to simply say, "Guess what?" Virtually everyone you say this to will stop what they're doing and say, "What?" That was easy. Now, at least for the moment, you have their complete and undivided attention. <br><br>You can produce a similar result by saying, "Can I ask you a question?" That's another easy yes. Test it out for yourself. Simply walk up to the next person you see and say, "Can I ask you a question?" This question usually stops people in their tracks because they instinctively begin to wonder what you are about to ask. <br><br>Both of these questions are designed to create what we call a mini-forum for engagement. We said earlier that you must first have a prospect's time and attention in order to position the value of your product or service. In the Conversational Layering Model, we characterized this as having a forum for selling. But sometimes (especially in sales) you have to walk before you can run. <br><br>At the very beginning of the sales process, sellers haven't yet earned the right to ask for several hours of the prospect's time. It's more likely that we are just trying to get through the first few minutes of the call. By asking for smaller commitments, you make it easier for prospects to engage-at least initially. Then, what you do to pique the prospect's interest further, will ultimately determine whether the sales process moves forward or stalls. <br><br>This is important because the larger sale is usually an accumulation of smaller successes; and if you can consistently secure the prospect's attention, you will create many more opportunities to expand your sales conversations. For example, I don't start probing for needs without first saying, "Can I ask a couple specifics about your current _________ environment?" Likewise, I rarely offer a suggestion without asking, "Would you like to hear some feedback?" We use this technique throughout QBS to garner the prospect's time and attention, which is much more effective than just trying to bully your way in. <br><br>I would like to add that leveraging curiosity in the strategic sales process is not a manipulation strategy. Quite the contrary. Asking questions to make sure it's OK to proceed is not only good manners, it demonstrates that you are sensitive to the prospect's situation and you are also very respectful of their needs. Let me ask you, do customers appreciate it when someone is respectful of their time and space?<br><br>Voice Mail: Friend or Foe?<br>For many sellers, voice mail is the enemy. It's the gatekeeper that stands in the way of a salesperson talking directly with the prospect they are trying to reach. As we said in chapter 1, thousands of voice-mail messages are being left every day, but only a small fraction of these calls are ever returned. <br><br>Prospects, on the other hand, think voice mail is terrific. Automated messaging systems have given them the flexibility to be out of the office and away from their desks, yet they can still receive important messages. Voice mail also enables key decision makers to screen incoming calls, so they can focus on their business rather than be interrupted by constant solicitations. <br><br>Some sales trainers teach salespeople to hang up when they get a prospect's voice mail and not leave a message. Instead, they would rather you keep calling and calling until the person you're trying to reach actually picks up the phone. The busier the prospect, or the more averse they are to receiving sales calls, the less productive this strategy is, however. <br><br>Other sales trainers suggest that you should leave increasingly forceful voice-mail messages so prospects will feel a sense of obligation to call you back. The problem is, these messages often fall victim to Charlie Brown's Teacher Syndrome (chapter 6), because salespeople end up leaving the same old worn-out messages over and over. <br><br>In QBS, we want to differentiate ourselves from the typical sales caller, but not just for the sake of being different. We want to differentiate ourselves for the sake of being more effective. This means leveraging curiosity on voice-mail messages to get more call backs and, ultimately, engage more prospects in productive sales conversation. <br><br>Once I learned how to make people curious, voice mail became a terrific asset and a good friend. In fact, one of the secrets to my success in selling was that I had a very high engagement rate-95 percent of the voice-mail messages I left generated a return call. Let me say that again: 95 percent of the people I called, called me back. Why did they call back? It's because when I left a voicemail message, I didn't think about features, benefits, solutions, needs, or relationships. I only thought about one thing-what could I say that will cause this person to become curious enough to call me back. <br><br>Leveraging curiosity does require some thought and creativity. There are no magical scripts that will guarantee your success on each and every call. But there are many ways that you can pique someone's interest (when leaving voice mail) in order to engage potential customers in a mutually productive sales conversation. Here are a few ideas to get you started. <br><br>A Question That Only You Can Answer <br>Salespeople aren't always calling new prospects. Sometimes we're calling people where there is already a relationship-for example, existing customers, business partners, or other contacts in our industry. Calling someone who is familiar can be much easier than making cold calls, but you still have to compete with everything else that's vying for that person's time and attention. So rather than leave the same old generic-sounding message, you might leave a voice-mail message that says: <br><br>Salesperson: "Hi Susan, this is (your name and affiliation). I was hoping to catch you for a minute because I have a question...that only you can answer. If you could please call me back, I'll be in my office this afternoon until around 4:30 P.M." <br><br>Will Susan return the call? If your voice-mail message makes her curious, she will. This technique is particularly effective because it's personal without being offensive. It also conveys a certain sense of urgency. After all, any question that "only you" can answer must be important. It's also very easy to implement. Before you dial the phone, just think of a question that only your prospect can answer. Examples include: "Susan, how do you feel about ______?" or "What is your opinion on ______?" These are questions that only Susan can answer (by definition) because you are soliciting her thoughts, feelings, and/or opinions. By the way, most people (that you have some familiarity with) love to give their opinions, and they will likely be flattered that you asked. <br><br>Something Made Me Think of You <br>Using a similar approach, you can make existing contacts curious, so they will respond to your call, by leaving a voice-mail message that says, "Hi Richard, I decided to pick up the telephone and call...because something happened earlier today that made me think of you. If you get a minute, I'll be in the office until around 6:15 P.M. this evening. My telephone number is (770) 840-7640." If you were Richard, would you return the call? Most people will, especially if they receive the message before 6:15 P.M. They would want to know what had happened that made you think of them. Note: when they do return your call, be ready with a story or anecdote that will lead the conversation into your business reason for calling. <br></p><h2>KJV Life Application Study Bible, Second Edition, Large Print (Red Letter, Hardcover)</h2><p>The <i>Life Application Study Bible</i> is today&#x2019;s #1&#x2013;selling study Bible.

After their earlier forced removal from traditional lands in the southeastern states--culminating in the devastating 'trail of tears' march of the Cherokees--these five so-called Civilized Tribes held federal land grants in perpetuity, or "as long as the waters run, as long as the grass grows." Yet after passage of the Dawes Act in 1887, the land was purchased back from the tribes, whose members were then systematically swindled out of their private parcels.</p><p> The publication of Debo's book fundamentally changed the way historians viewed, and wrote about, American Indian history. Writers from Oliver LaFarge, who characterized it as "a work of art," to Vine Deloria, Jr., and Larry McMurtry acknowledge debts to Angie Debo. Fifty years after the book's publication, McMurtry praised Debo's work in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>: "The reader," he wrote, "is pulled along by her strength of mind and power of sympathy." </p><p>Because the book's findings implicated prominent state politicians and supporters of the University of Oklahoma, the university press there was forced to reject the book in .... for fear of libel suits and backlash against the university.

But such a picture of Jesus is far from accurate, according to John Howard Yoder. This watershed work in New Testament ethics leads us to a Savior who was deeply concerned with the agenda of politics and the related issues of power, status, and right relations. By canvassing Luke&#39;s Gospel, Yoder argues convincingly that the true impact of Jesus&#39; life and ministry on his disciples&#39; social behavior points to a specific kind of Christian pacifism in which &#34;the cross of Christ is the model of Christian social efficacy.&#34; This second edition of The Politics of Jesus provides up-to-date interaction with recent publications that touch on Yoder&#39;s timely topic. Following most of the chapters are new &#34;epilogues&#34; summarizing research conducted during the last two decades - research that continues to support the outstanding insights set forth in Yoder&#39;s original work.</p><p><b>Christianity Today</b>,&nbsp;<i>Top 10 Books of the 20th Century</i>&nbsp;(2000)<br><br><b>Stanley Hauwerwas in Christian Century</b><br> "I am convinced that when Christians look back on this century of theology in America,&nbsp;<i>The Politics of Jesus</i>&nbsp;will be seen as a new beginning."<br><br><b>Dennis P.

Yoder presses beyond the question of whether Jesus was political to ask what sort of politics is the mark of Christian discipleship."<br><br><b>Max L.

Filled with photographs and drawings and written in clear, direct prose, it's basic enough to demystify the ABC's of a complex sport and sophisticated enough to remain useful as a ready reference and constant refresher no matter what your angling skills. "The book," Rosenbauer admits up front, "is the bare bones of fly fishing; it does not set out to tell everything." The opening chapter answers the most important question for beginners: What <i>is</i> fly-fishing? "Fly casting," he explains, "makes it possible to deliver a relatively weightless lure or imitation of a living creature on target, using line weight to develop momentum. That's a fairly dry way of saying that, using a fly rod, you can catch fish with an artificial lure that can't be presented by any other method." Rosenbauer goes on to cover rods and line sizes, reels, leaders, casting technique, flies, fly selection, fish behavior, tactics, and accessories. He even provides an essential reading list. That's a lot, sure, but it's not <i>everything</i>, and that's the <i>Guide</i>'s strength. It doesn't tie you up in knots (even if it does unravel the necessary knots you'll need to know to succeed). Instead, it works with basic principles, encouraging you to just get out there and cast your line--and lot--with enough confidence and skill to begin a relationship that should take you the rest of your life to really understand. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>Here is a complete, down-to-earth, and highly practical introduction to the exciting sport of fly fishing. All the important elements and types of fly fishing are presented: tackle selection, casting, presentation, flies and their special uses; successful techniques on stream, pond, or ocean; tackle, flies, and special methods of fishing for every major gamefish in fresh and saltwater, from bluegill to tarpon.Whether you want a complete basic "course" in fly fishing or simply to refresh yourself on special aspects of the sport, The Orvis Fly-Fishing Guide will prove invaluable. As Silvio Calabi, Editor of Rod &amp; Reel, has said: "This Guide may be the single most valuable item a novice angler can buy . . . and most of us would do well to reread the section on flies, fly selection and stream tactics every spring before pulling on our waders for the first time."

Teeming with danger as well as beauty, the vast marshland offers Elnora an unexpected way to build a better life.<br>Gene Stratton-Porter's <i>A Girl of the Limberlost</i> has captivated readers since its initial appearance in 1909. Its realistic characters are headed by an intelligent, independent heroine who has served as a positive role model for generations. Its portrait of Elnora's blossoming friendship with a young man who shares her joy in nature depicts a pure romance, rooted in shared interests and mutual respect. Written by a popular Midwestern author of the early twentieth century, this is a book to cherish.</p><p>A Girl of the Limberlost is unquestionably the most cherished books. It is the timeless story of an impoverished young girl, Elnora Comstock, growing up on the edge of the Limberlost swamp, and in order to pay for her education, she collects moths.Gene Stratton-Porter (August 17, 1863 &#x2013; December 6, 1924) was an American author, amateur naturalist, wildlife photographer, and one of the earliest women to form a movie studio and production company. She wrote some best-selling novels and well-received columns in national magazines, such as McCalls. Her works were translated into several languages, including Braille, and Stratton-Porter was estimated to have had 50 million readers around the world. She used her position and income as a well-known author to support conservation of Limberlost Swamp and other wetlands in the state of Indiana. Her novel A Girl of the Limberlost was adapted four times as a film, most recently in 1990 in a made-for-TV version.</p><h2>The Americano: Fighting with Castro for Cuba&#39;s Freedom</h2><p>"Why do I fight here in this land so foreign to my own? Why did I come here far from my home and family?...Is it because I seek adventure? No...I am here because I believe that the most important thing for free men to do is to protect the freedom of others."<br>&#x2015;William Morgan, in a letter to Herbert Matthews at the <i>New York Times</i><br><br>When William Morgan was twenty-two years old, he was working as a high school janitor in Toledo Ohio. Seven years later, in 1958, he walked into a Rebel camp in the Cuban Jungle to join the revolutionaries in their fight to overthrow the corrupt Cuban president, Fulgencio Batista. They were wary of the broad-shouldered, blond-haired, blue-eyed <i>americano</i> but Morgan's dedication and passion, his military skill and charisma, led him to become a chief comandante in Castro's army&#x2015;he was the only foreigner to hold such a rank, with the exception of Che Guevera.<br><br>Vicious battles in the jungles were followed by victorious revelry in the cities. Morgan married a Cuban beauty. He single-handedly thwarted the Dominican Republic's attempt to overthrow Castro. And he was chosen to work with Castro and other high ranking Rebels to improve the quality of life for <i>all</i> people. This man who had lived under the radar in America was now a Cuban hero on the watch lists of several governments, all of whom wondered whose side he was really on. <br><br>It all ended in 1961, when, at age thirty-two, Morgan was executed by firing squad, at the hands of Fidel Castro.<br><br>Journalist Aran Shetterly takes us back to an era when democracy <i>could</i> have flourished in Cuba. He interviewed Morgan's friends and family and former Cuban Rebels, and examined FBI and CIA documents in search of the truth. What emerged was the true story of a young man who had never fit in but finally found his place in the world by fighting another country's war.</p><p>At age twenty-nine, William Morgan left Toledo, Ohio, and traveled to Cuba to fight alongside Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in the revolution that would expel the corrupt president Batista from the Cuban government. At first, the Cubans were distrustful of el Americano, but Morgan's dedication and passion, his military skill and charisma, led him to become a chief comandante of the Revolution, the only foreigner to hold such a rank with the exception of Che.<br> <br> After working at first for Castro, and then perhaps against him when it became clear that Castro had no intention of setting up a democracy ,Morgan was executed by firing squad at the dictator's hands. To this day, Morgan is considered a traitor by some Cubans, a hero by others.<br> <br> By interviewing Morgan's friends and family and former Cuban Rebels, and examining FBI documents, what Aran Shetterly found were stories from an era when democracy could have flourished in Cuba and the true tale of how a young man who never fit in finally found his place in the world by fighting another country's war.Aran Shetterly attended Harvard College and the University of Southern Maine, where he completed a master's degree in American studies. He is on the board of the Americans Who Tell the Truth organization and the Union of Maine Visual Artists, for which he conceived, organized, and ran an exchange between artists from Maine and Cuba. He lives in Mexico, where he and his wife founded <i>Inside Mexico</i>, an English-language newspaper.</p><h2>Love, Skip, Jump: Start Living the Adventure of Yes</h2><p><p><b>Every significant event in the Bible happened because someone said <i>yes</i> to God.

Or was it&nbsp;<i>shirking?</i>&nbsp;Clearly, the adults in his life have no clue and can't help.<br><br>In the end, Treehorn figures it out on his own, and all is well. At least until he turns green.<br><br>A charming, imaginative classic that will appeal to any kid who feels they're not truly seen or heard by the grown-ups in their life. Works for adults, too.<br><br><i><b>An ALA Notable Children's Book<br></b></i><b><i>A New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year</i></b></p><p>Treehorn is clearly shrinking, and his parents aren't the least bit interested. His mother is obsessed with whether or not her cake will rise. His father, at one point addressing a son who can barely see over the table, states blindly, "Nobody shrinks." Treehorn doesn't seem all that bothered that his clothes are hanging over his extremities; he just feels someone should know. But the adults he tries to notify brush off his claim as either a ploy for attention or downright bad behavior.<p>Treehorn's parents, his teacher, and his principal respond (or fail to respond) to his drastically diminishing stature in ways that will ring true to any kid who has tried to convince adults of the existence of fairies, the Loch Ness Monster, or things that go bump in the night. Edward Gorey's stark, intricately patterned black-and-white drawings are simultaneously quaint and creepy, setting the perfect stage for Treehorn's tale--a story for any child who has ever felt ignored by grown-ups (in other words, a story for all). <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>Florence Parry Heide (1919 &#x2013; 2011) was born in Pittsburgh and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1939.

Had the thought actually crossed my mind, I would have immediately relegated it to that crowded portion of my brain where things <i>I should do someday but thankfully never will</i> are safely locked away to languish and die.</p><p>The idea was my daughter McKenna's. Three months before she graduated from high school, her sociology teacher, a graying, long-haired Haight-Ashbury throwback who had traded in his tie-dye T-shirts for tweed jackets with leather elbow patches presented to his class the opportunity to go to South America on a humanitarian mission. McKenna became obsessed with the idea and asked if I would accompany her on such an excursion -- kind of a daddy-daughter date in the Amazon.</p><p>I agreed. Not that I had any real desire or intention of going. I figured that she would soon graduate and her mind would be occupied with other concerns. I never believed it would really come about.</p><p>I should have known my daughter better. Four months later I found myself standing with her and a dozen of her former classmates in the Salt Lake City airport boarding a plane for Lima, Peru.</p><p>Unbeknownst to our little group, we had entrusted our lives to novices. We were the first group our expeditionary guides had actually led into the Amazon -- a fact we discovered twenty-four hours later deep in a jungle teeming with anacondas, jaguars and hand-sized spiders. Several times in the course of our expedition, our guide, an elderly Peruvian man, would suddenly stop, lay his machete at the foot of a tree, then climb above the jungle canopy for a look, each time descending with a somewhat perplexed expression.</p><p>After our third complete change of course I asked our guide (as tactfully as one being led through a jungle must) if he knew where he was going. In broken English the old man replied, "Yes, I have been here before..." then added, "when I was six."</p><p>During our hike we came upon the village of an Amazonian tribe, the Los Palmos. Overjoyed to learn that they were neither cannibals nor headhunters, we soon noticed that the population of the village included no young men, only women and the elderly. Our guide asked one of the natives where all the young men had gone.</p><p>"They have gone to town to kill the mayor," she replied.</p><p>"Why?" our guide asked.</p><p>"The mayor has said we can no longer cut the rainforest trees. We cannot live without the wood from the trees. So our men have gone to kill him."</p><p>"Do you think that's a good idea?" our guide asked.</p><p>The woman shrugged. "Probably not, but it's how things are done in the jungle."</p><p>There was something refreshing about her logic. I've never been overly fond of politics, and the image of painted tribesmen carrying spears and bows into town hall delighted me -- certainly something we don't see enough of in Salt Lake City. I still wonder how that all turned out.</p><p>Two days into our journey we ran out of food. For several days we lived on jungle fruit and the piranhas we caught in the river. (Piranha doesn't taste that bad -- kind of like chicken.)</p><p>I remember, as a boy, sitting spellbound through a Saturday afternoon matinee about a school of piranhas that terrorized a small jungle village. These Hollywood piranhas swam in conveniently slow-moving schools that cinematically frothed and bubbled on the surface, allowing the hero a chance to swim across the river and rescue a woman just inches ahead of the churning piranha death.</p><p>The piranhas we encountered in the jungle were nothing like that. First, Amazon piranhas are nearly as ubiquitous in the jungle as vegetation. Drop a fishing line in any jungle river and within seconds it will be bitten. Usually in half. Second, there are no warning bubbles.</p><p>Adding crocodiles, electric eels and leeches to the mix, we decided it best to just keep out of the water.</p><p>After several days of traveling we reached our destination, a small village where we established our clinic. The Quechuan natives were waiting for us.</p><p>The goal of our humanitarian mission was threefold: teach basic hygiene, fix teeth and correct vision. I was assigned to the latter. The optometrist who hiked in with us would conduct an eye examination, then hand me a written prescription for eyeglasses that I would attempt to fill from the bags of used eyewear we had packed into the jungle.</p><p>I remember one patient in particular. He was an elderly man, small featured and sun-baked, his skin as leathery as a baseball glove. And he had just one eye. As he was led from his exam to my station, the doctor handed me a blank prescription.</p><p>"What do I do with this?" I asked.</p><p>"Find the thickest lens you can find," he replied. "He's all but blind."</p><p>I knew the pair. Earlier, as I was organizing the glasses, I had come across a pair of lenses so thick I was certain they were bulletproof. I retrieved them and placed them on the little man's face. I soon learned that he had not just one eye, but also just one tooth as a broad smile blanketed his face. <i>"!Puedo ver!"</i> he exclaimed. <i>I can see!</i></p><p>It was my daughter's job to tend the children as the doctors treated their parents. Indelibly etched in my mind is a sweet mental picture of my daughter as I looked out to see her running and screaming in mock terror from a throng of bare-chested little boys, who were laughing so hard they would occasionally fall to the ground holding their stomachs.</p><p>As we left the village, the children gathered around her and she hugged each of them. We sat together in the back of the bus, and she grew very quiet. After a few minutes I asked her what she had learned from this experience. She thought about it a moment, then said, "We love those whom we serve."</p><p>We moved on by boat up the muddy Rio Madre de Dios past the camps of the illicit gold miners scarring the forest with their bulldozers and sluices, eventually coming to a small clearing in the jungle. An airfield. Boarding a cargo plane, we flew south to Cuzco, where we took buses up into the Andes Mountains to a rundown hacienda.</p><p>The hacienda had been magnificent once, with elaborate tiles and intricate woodwork. It had a stone courtyard, a balcony and a bell tower. But the opulence of centuries ago was gone now, and what remained, rotting and looted, provided barely adequate shelter for the orphan boys it now housed. The place was called El Girasol -- the Sunflower -- and it was in the business of saving street children.</p><p>Among all the people we encountered in this mystical land, it was here that we met the most memorable: an American by the name of Paul Cook.</p><p>I was told by one of our guides that Paul Cook had once been a successful emergency room physician. Up until one Christmas Day when everything changed.</p><p>One night, after we had completed our day's tasks, we sat around a fire recounting the day's events as darkness closed in around us. Gradually our group retired to their sleeping quarters and I found myself alone with this quiet, intriguing man. We talked mostly about America; about the NBA, current movies, the Oscars and whom I thought would win the next presidential election. When I had satisfied his curiosity about current events, I asked him what prompted him to come to Peru. He just stared into the fire. Then he said, without looking at me, "That's a long story."</p><p>"No clocks in the jungle," I said.</p><p>Still gazing into the fire, he smiled at the use of one of his own favorite phrases. After a moment he said, "I'll show you."</p><p>He led me through the labyrinth of the hacienda to a small windowless cell with a wooden floor and a high ceiling. The room was as austere as any I had seen in the orphanage and was lit by a single lightbulb hanging from a cord from the exposed rafters. There were a few simple pieces of furniture: a small tin washbasin, a crate for a desk with a wooden chair and a bed that was just a mattress on box springs set on wooden blocks.</p><p>And there were books. Lots of books, visibly well-read and stacked in sloppy piles against the wall. I scanned the titles. Classics and bestsellers, <i>Reader's Digest</i> compilations, medical journals and crossword puzzles, biographies and thrillers. Books in Spanish as well as English. There were a few love stories.</p><p>On the wall above the books were two framed photographs: one of an elderly couple I guessed to be his parents, the other of a beautiful young woman whom I was to learn was named Christine. The most peculiar adornment to the room was a movie poster: a moody, black and indigo poster of a man kissing a woman beneath a title written in Italian: <i>Cinema Paradiso.</i></p><p>Paul let me take in the surroundings for a moment before motioning for me to sit on the bed. I noticed that he had something in his hand -- a hand-sewn leather pouch. He untied its drawstrings and took from it a small toy soldier and handed it to me. Then he sat down next to me and commenced his tale. An hour or so later, when he was done, he looked weary and spent and I could sense the walls rising again in his demeanor, as if maybe he feared that he had shared too much. He restored the soldier to its pouch, hanging it by its drawstrings to a nail on the wall.</p><p>I asked if I could share his story. He showed little interest in my request but said he would sleep on it, a reply I also understood as my dismissal. Three days later, just a few hours before we were to fly back to Lima, he agreed.</p><p>It's been said, <i>Seek not your destiny for it is seeking you.</i> Paul Cook's story reveals, as well as any I suppose, that this is true. It was equally true for a young woman named Christine, who went to the jungle looking for anything but love.</p><p>This is their story.</p><p>Copyright � 2005 by Richard Paul Evans</p></p><h2>Beginning Wisely : Teacher&#39;s Manual by Inc.

But Newman was also an oddity in Hollywood: the rare box-office titan who cared about the craft of acting, the sexy leading man known for the staying power of his marriage, and the humble celebrity who made philanthropy his calling card long before it was cool. <br><br>The son of a successful entrepreneur, Newman grew up in a prosperous Cleveland suburb. Despite fears that he would fail to live up to his father&#x2019;s expectations, Newman bypassed the family sporting goods business to pursue an acting career. After struggling as a theater and television actor, Newman saw his star rise in a tragic twist of fate, landing the role of boxer Rocky Graziano in <i>Somebody Up There Likes Me</i> when James Dean was killed in a car accident. Though he would joke about instances of &#x201c;Newman&#x2019;s luck&#x201d; throughout his career, he refused to coast on his stunning boyish looks and impish charm. Part of the original Actors Studio generation, Newman demanded a high level of rigor and clarity from every project. The artistic battles that nearly derailed his early movie career would pay off handsomely at the box office and earn him critical acclaim. <br><br>He applied that tenacity to every endeavor both on and off the set. The outspoken Newman used his celebrity to call attention to political causes dear to his heart, including civil rights and nuclear proliferation. Taking up auto racing in midlife, Newman became the oldest driver to ever win a major professional auto race. A food enthusiast who would dress his own salads in restaurants, he launched the Newman&#x2019;s Own brand dedicated to fresh ingredients, a nonprofit juggernaut that has generated more than $250 million for charity.<br><br>In <i>Paul Newman: A Life</i>, film critic and pop culture historian Shawn Levy gives readers the ultimate behind-the-scenes examination of the actor&#x2019;s life, from his merry pranks on the set to his lasting romance with Joanne Woodward to the devastating impact of his son&#x2019;s death from a drug overdose. This definitive biography is a fascinating portrait of an extraordinarily gifted man who gave back as much as he got out of life and just happened to be one of the most celebrated movie stars of the twentieth century.</p><p>SHAWN LEVY is the film critic for <i>The Oregonian</i> and the author of <i>The Last Playboy, Ready, Steady, Go!, Rat Pack Confidential</i>, and <i>King of Comedy</i>.

The cracker-barrel homilies; the good-natured ironies; the snapshots of bygone ways; the razor-sharp observations couched in polite language; the hints of pain; the hesitance toward joy; the sneaky surges of emotion; the climax that brings a welling to your eyes despite yourself. It contains us, Thornton Wilder&#x2019;s chestnut.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why it can sometimes feel that if you&#x2019;ve seen one production of it, you&#x2019;ve seen &#x2019;em all.<br><br>Or maybe not.<br><br>Take this one&#x2014;in particular, take the male leads.<br><br>The Stage Manager is a hawkish fellow: slender, purposeful, knowing, vigilant. He dresses for comfort and doesn&#x2019;t care if his collar is straight or if his tie is askew. Disheveled, with his spectacles perched on the tip of his nose and a vaguely distracted air, he&#x2019;s still rakishly handsome; clearly he was a corker in his time. He appears to have lived every vicissitude of life, and while experience hasn&#x2019;t entirely softened him, it has provided him a store of indulgence to mete out, judiciously but amiably, as he sees fit. There&#x2019;s no doubt that he can size a body up in a few piercing measures, and there&#x2019;s no doubt, either, that his arithmetic is sure. But such is his air of decency and authority that you find yourself hoping he deems you worthy.<br><br>George Gibbs, the youthful hero, is another matter: an all-American boy with muscles in his shoulders and, you can&#x2019;t help but suspect, in his head. His heart is in the right place, heaven knows, even if he must occasionally be reminded of just where that place is. He&#x2019;s a handsome thing, and enthusiasms burble out of him infectiously. His gaze is open, and his springy mien belies a real zest for life. But when he takes the time to notice smaller things or surprises himself by stumbling upon a sincere emotion, he turns puppyish. He even, caught up in the swell of love, croons; you wouldn&#x2019;t tune a piano to it, but it&#x2019;s sincere.<br><br>Their interactions are brief but memorable. At one moment the Stage Manager assumes the aspect of a biddy and lashes out at poor, dim George for tossing a ball to himself in the middle of the road. &#x201c;You got no business playing baseball on Main Street,&#x201d; he cackles in an old lady&#x2019;s voice, cowing the boy, and you reckon he&#x2019;s getting a kick out of his charade as the lad dutifully scampers off.<br><br>Later, when George escorts his sweetheart, Emily, to the drugstore for an ice cream soda, the Stage Manager takes the persona of Mr. Morgan, proprietor and counterman. Precisely and warmly, he crafts the fountain treats for the youngsters, and when it turns out that George has forgotten his pocket money at home, he refuses to accept the boy&#x2019;s gold watch as collateral for the debt: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll trust you ten years, George&#x2014;not a day over.&#x201d;<br><br>You sense affection in the older man and, equally, respect in the younger; the mutuality is warming. And as is so often the case, the warmth arises not only from the material but from the actors themselves &#x2014;a real coup of casting, in fact.<br><br>The old man has acted for Leo McCarey, who directed the Marx Brothers, and Michael Curtiz, who made Casablanca, and he appeared many times on live television during that medium&#x2019;s golden age.

You think of Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, and James Stewart as his equals. The kid is making a big name for himself, but he keeps getting compared to other actors, often as a way of dismissing him or counting him short: Marlon Brando, most often, and James Dean.<br><br>One has just turned thirty, has been married for six years, and has three children, the oldest not quite five. The other is seventy-eight, with his forty-fifth anniversary coming up and five grown daughters and a pair of grandkids with whom to celebrate it.<br><br>Physically, they share some traits: wavy hair, icy blue eyes, a classical handsomeness that looks patrician on the old fellow and preppy on the kid, and a springy grace that makes the young man seem coltish and the old man seem spry.<br><br>But their personalities are pretty distinct. The old guy is serious, a World War II vet who attended Kenyon College and the Yale School of Drama on the GI Bill and dreamed of becoming a teacher and takes an active part in politics; he&#x2019;s raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity and served as president of the Actors Studio. The young guy is famous for his beer drinking and his practical jokes and his goofball sense of humor and his love of fast cars and motorcycles and his roles as antiauthoritarian rebels; he&#x2019;s already created a couple of parts on Broadway that have maintained a place in the national repertoire and made a few indelible TV dramas.<br><br>The older man you know: Paul Newman, playing the Stage Manager in the Westport County Playhouse production of Our Town as filmed at the Booth Theater on Broadway in early 2003.<br><br>And the younger man, well, you know him too: Paul Newman, playing George Gibbs in the same play, adapted as a musical for NBC television&#x2019;s Producers&#x2019; Showcase in September 1955.<br><br>Between those two performances sits an entire career and, indeed, an entire life&#x2014;not only of one man but of the culture in which he thrived.<br><br>The blind, impetuous vigor of youth; the wry, still acceptance of maturity; the progress of an artist in his craft; the maturation of a soul, a mind, a body; the life of a man and the half-century of history he lived and echoed and symbolized and even shaped: Paul Newman&#x2019;s story is all of it.<br><br>From a burgeoning Jazz Age suburb to a torpedo bomber in the Pacific, from the womb of academia to the free-for-all of Broadway and live TV, from the gilded cage of a Hollywood studio contract to the wild freedom of directing films for his own production company, from the filth and noise and danger of professional auto racing to the staid and venerable confines of the Philanthropy Hall of Fame, Paul Newman&#x2019;s life is a blazon of the American century, incorporating the very best national traits in a compact and comely package.<br><br>For fifty years, on-screen and off, Newman vividly embodied certain tendencies in the American male character: active and roguish and earnest and sly and determined and vulnerable and brave and humble and reliable and compassionate and fair. He was a man of his time, and that time ranged from World War II to the contemporary era of digitally animated feature films. He was equally at home on Hollywood soundstages, in theatrical workshops, in the pits of racetracks, and especially on the blessedly raucous fields and in the log cabins and swimming holes of the camps he built and maintained for seriously ill children. The world was his for the claiming&#x2014;and he claimed only the bit that he felt was reasonably due him, and he gave back more, by far, than he ever took.<br><br>He was ridiculously handsome and trim, with a face that belonged on an ancient coin, eyes that stunned and dazed even cynics, and an athlete&#x2019;s compact, lithe, and peppy body. Having fallen into acting as a profession, he would have been guaranteed at least minimal success by sheer virtue of his physical charms. If he&#x2019;d had no talent or tenacity or intellect or drive, he might still have enjoyed fame and riches. Put him in a dinner jacket, and he could sit confidently at table with presidents or poets or kings. He looked the part&#x2014;in fact, he looked any part, virtually, that he was asked to play.<br><br>But he was smart and cagey and suspicious of fortune too easily won, and he was scrupulous in distinguishing the things that came to him through luck from those he felt he&#x2019;d earned. He opted to live as far as reasonable from Hollywood, preferred barn coats and blue jeans to tuxedos, and chose the company of troupers and mechanics and beer- swillers over that of celebrities and swells and hobnobbers every time. There was crust and vinegar to him, and he relished the opportunity that his position in life afforded him to startle big shots with his sometimes downmarket tastes and preferences. And vice versa: he loved to sprinkle unexpected stardust in the humblest of contexts, just when he was taken for an ordinary joe.<br><br>He was, as he always insisted, a private man whose profession gave him a public face. And he grappled with the incongruity of that for a long time. If he was a cautious and shy fellow raised to a painfully puritanical ethos, he would learn to espouse his inner wildness by adapting personae&#x2014;in life and in art&#x2014;that camoflagued his insecurity and reticence in the cloth of exuberance and levity. If he was treated as a freak because of the inescapable fact that he was born beautiful, he would learn to turn that beauty into a tool of subterfuge, creating characters whose allure hid complex and painful depths. If his looks would make him a star, he would redirect that stardom into a benefit for others, slapping his face on labels for food products and creating staggering wealth&#x2014;then giving all the money away. If he was, regardless of his age, a sex symbol, he would work hard at being a good husband and father. If his personal wealth meant that he could take up motor sports at a high level, he would work as tenaciously at racing as he did at acting and earn acceptance in that world through sheer application and diligently acquired skill. If things came easily to him, he determined to share the benefit he accrued.<br><br>Few have lived fuller or richer lives than Paul Newman, and at the time of his death, the world seemed to take stock for the first time of all the Paul Newmans it had known: the actor, the driver, the public citizen, ...</p><h2>Fasting and Feasting: The Life of Visionary Food Writer Patience Gray</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book for 2017--Now in Paperback<br> </strong></p> <p>For more than thirty years, Patience Gray&#x2015;author of the celebrated cookbook <em>Honey from a Weed</em>&#x2015;lived in a remote area of Puglia in southernmost Italy. She lived without electricity, modern plumbing, or a telephone, grew much of her own food, and gathered and ate wild plants alongside her neighbors in this economically impoverished region. She was fond of saying that she wrote only for herself and her friends, yet her growing reputation brought a steady stream of international visitors to her door. This simple and isolated life she chose for herself may help explain her relative obscurity when compared to the other great food writers of her time: M. F. K. Fisher, Elizabeth David, and Julia Child.</p> <p>So it is not surprising that when Gray died in 2005, the BBC described her as an &#x201c;almost forgotten culinary star.&#x201d; Yet her influence, particularly among chefs and other food writers, has had a lasting and profound effect on the way we view and celebrate good food and regional cuisines. Gray&#x2019;s prescience was unrivaled: She wrote about what today we would call the Slow Food movement&#x2015;from foraging to eating locally&#x2015;long before it became part of the cultural mainstream. Imagine if Michael Pollan or Barbara Kingsolver had spent several decades living among Italian, Greek, and Catalan peasants, recording their recipes and the significance of food and food gathering to their way of life.</p> <p>In <em>Fasting and Feasting,</em> biographer Adam Federman tells the remarkable&#x2015;and until now untold&#x2015;life story of Patience Gray: from her privileged and intellectual upbringing in England, to her trials as a single mother during World War II, to her career working as a designer, editor, translator, and author, and describing her travels and culinary adventures in later years. A fascinating and spirited woman, Patience Gray was very much a part of her times but very clearly ahead of them.</p></p><p><p>Adam Federman is a reporting fellow with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute covering energy and the environment.

Struck by her mind, her vision and her prose, [Federman] went in search of [Gray's] past. The massive research he undertook is evident, but he handles it gracefully; and this richly textured material unfolds at a gentle pace. . . &nbsp;He&#x2019;s done the most important thing a biographer can do: He&#x2019;s created a fully formed character in these pages, honoring not only her brilliance but the rough edges that made her human.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Patience Gray is one of the most important food writers you&#x2019;ve never heard of. Long before she published 'Honey from a Weed' (1986), her most enduring work, Gray endured hunger in the margins of society in London, during the lean times of both World Wars, and consequently in the kitchen her methods were simple, yet beautifully tied to nature, poetry, and art. She traveled extensively, eventually making a life in the Italian countryside. Three decades were spent in rough, remote Puglia without running water, refrigeration, or other modern niceties. It was in this far-flung place that Gray would write that iconic piece of culinary history. The title was celebrated at the time, but for today&#x2019;s local food fanatics, it&#x2019;s venerated. Gray&#x2019;s work was cookbook poetry, steeped in Mediterranean lore, with recipes hearkening back to Virgil. Even her indexes became legendary. Her life made her as much a maverick as her culinary writing. Investigative environmental and food journalist Federman's biography will attract today's farm-to-table enthusiasts, and tells a little known story of someone who was eons ahead of her time."</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Foreword Reviews-</em></strong></p> <p>&#x201c;This deliberate and meticulous biography chronicles the life of a remarkable food writer whose self-sufficiency and love of nature placed her ahead of her time. Patience Gray, the author of the classic &#x2018;Honey from a Weed, lived off the grid in southern Italy from 1970 until her death in 2005. She grew almost all her own food, and wrote and made art primarily for her friends and family. &#x2018;Fasting and Feasting&#x2019; is broadly appealing as it explores her life and philosophy. A valuable resource on Gray&#x2019;s early life and career as a journalist, the book, incorporating meticulous research, bears much fruit. Descriptions of Gray&#x2019;s career, motivations, and personal life are extremely detailed. That this slows the pace of the book is in keeping with Gray&#x2019;s personal philosophy: speeding through conveniently is a poor substitute for taking time and savoring the process. Though it only rarely draws a strong connection between Gray&#x2019;s love of nature and modern awareness of sustainability, the book offers a valuable example of what a sustainable lifestyle can offer to the modern world. Aside from being a woman who stood on principle in an age when she was generally expected to behave herself, Gray is a captivating biographical subject and spokesperson for simple, slow living. Modern audiences, particularly those interested in eco-friendly alternative structures for their lives and careers, will find this book to be a worthy read."</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Federman's book is meticulously researched . . . .

No one before her or since has written with more first-hand experience or with the blunt, clear-eyed eloquence that she brought to her classic memoir of Mediterranean village life,&nbsp;<em>Honey from a Weed.</em>&nbsp;Federman illuminates her unlikely path from the post-war London newspaper world and translating&nbsp;<em>Larousse</em> <em>Gastronomique</em> to stone quarries across the northern Mediterranean and the remote, sculpture-studded corner of Apulia where she settled, wrote, and engaged with the growing community of food writers, sometimes contentiously. <em>Fasting and Feasting</em> is a timely celebration of a remarkable life.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Harold McGee, author of <em>On Food and Cooking</em><em>: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x2018;Patience Gray&#x2019;s <em>Honey from a Weed </em>is an anomaly in the world of cookbooks&#x2015;an inimitable, passionate, and reader-challenging account of her off-the-grid life in poverty-stricken rural areas of Catalonia, Tuscany, the Cyclades, and, most importantly, Apulia.</p> <p>&#x2018;Part acerbic diarist, part gifted ethnobotanist, part fervent environmentalist, part food writer whose recipes still spoke their rustic dialect, Patience Gray wove her life, thoughts, and experiences into an indisputable masterpiece.

Their trip together-to the grain elevator where the father works-is both a time for closeness ("Just me-no brothers-in the big front seat.") and a chance for the child to experience his surroundings in a fresh way. Shannon's writing style is simple yet graceful, with well-chosen details. The softly colored illustrations done in charcoal, pastel, and colored pencils have a textured look that works well with the nostalgic tone of the story. Allen's handling of color and light, his strategically designed compositions, and his imaginative sense of scale are all marks of his artistic skill.

Sam thinks the land looks like their tablecloth, "but with ribbons of road instead of red," and his house seems to be "hiding under trees like a sneaky cat." With homespun imagery and a laconic style, Shannon's ( Dancing the Breeze ) text emphasizes Sam's pleasure in "sharing time" alone with his father: "just me--no brothers--in the big front seat." Allen's ( In Coal Country ; Going West ) pastel illustrations are among his best and are particularly well suited to the text: the green patchwork countryside fairly shimmers in the hazy sunlight, while the heat at the dusty, small-town intersection is nearly palpable.

Dennis offers a pithy guide for those determined to attempt what he calls the getting of money-regardless of the consequences. His eighty-eight tips include: <br><br> ? Do not fall in love with any project. You may believe in it wholeheartedly, but must remain prepared to abandon it should it show signs of failing. <br> ? If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly and even catastrophically, you will never be rich. <br> ? You will never get rich working for your boss. <br><br> No one knows better than Dennis what it takes to get rich, and his battle-tested advice-delivered with his signature wit-will surely appeal to serious entrepreneurs.</p><p>Felix Dennis is the chairman of Dennis Publishing, which publishes <i>The Week</i> among many other magazines. He was the founder of <i>Maxim</i>, one of the most successful new magazines of the last decade. He has written several volumes of poetry that have been performed live onstage by the Royal Shakespeare Company. His other interests include breeding rare pigs, drinking French wine, collecting first edition books, and avoiding business meetings. He has homes in London, Stratford-upon-Avon, New York City, Connecticut, and the Caribbean island of Mustique.Dennis, founder of Maxim magazine, is one misunderstood mogul. He intended his previous book, How to Get Rich, to be ironic. Readers found it "inspirational," and he's back in the ring to make his point. Like the first book, this is another tongue-in-cheek "anti-self help manual, written to dissuade the majority of readers from making the attempt to acquire real wealth." He presents short meditations on motivation, rules of management, and conquering mental impediments. His wit is dry, and his advice ranges from thought provoking ("If you cannot treat your quest to get rich as a game&#x2014;a silly game with serious rules&#x2014;you will never be rich") to, more frequently, exceedingly silly ("You are a wild pig rooting for truffles. You are a weasel about to rip the throat out of a rabbit. You are an entrepreneur.")&#x2014;but the crabby tone becomes grating. And since some of the content was repurposed from the original book, this collection, for all its entertainment value, ends up feeling slim and unfulfilling. Maybe the third time really will be the charm. (Apr.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.</p><h2>The Survival Guide for Kids with ADD or ADHD</h2><p>What are ADD and ADHD?

A contemporary of Washington, Henry stood with John and Samuel Adams among the leaders of the colonial resistance to Great Britain that ultimately created the United States. The first governor of Virginia after independence, he was re-elected several times. After declining to attend the Constitutional Convention of 1787, Henry opposed the Constitution, arguing that it granted too much power to the central government. Although he denounced slavery as evil, like many other southern slave-owners he accepted its continuation. Henry pushed vigorously for the ten amendments to the new Constitution, and then supported Washington and national unity against the bitter party divisions of the 1790s. He was enormously influential in his time, but his accomplishments, other than his oratory, were subsequently all but forgotten. Kukla&#x2019;s biography restores Henry and his Virginia compatriots to the front rank of advocates for American independence.<br> <br>Jon Kukla has thoroughly researched Henry&#x2019;s life, even living on one of Henry&#x2019;s estates. He brings both newly discovered documents and new insights to the story of the patriot who played a central role in the movement to independence, the Revolution, the Constitutional era, and the early Republic. This book is an important contribution to our understanding of the nation&#x2019;s founding.</p><p>Jon Kukla is the author of&nbsp;<i>Patrick Henry</i>, <i>Mr. Jefferson&#x2019;s Women</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America</i>, as well as many scholarly articles and reviews.

As he pondered the blood congealing under his fingernails, Henry whispered words of comfort to his wife and children and waited for the mercury to cure him or kill him.<br> <br>Henry was sixty-three. He had been seriously ill since early April, when he described his symptoms to physician George Cabell, of Lynchburg, as something &#x201c;like the Gravel.&#x201d; Kidney stones large and small&#x2014;the stone and the gravel&#x2014;were common afflictions in the eighteenth century, painful or annoying but rarely fatal. Pharmacy ads in the Virginia Gazette touted cures and treatments such as tincture of goldenrod, Blackrie&#x2019;s Lixivium, and Swinsen&#x2019;s Electuary for the Stone and Gravel.<br> <br>By the first of June, Dr. Cabell&#x2019;s diagnosis was more grim. Henry was now suffering from a life-threatening intestinal obstruction called intussusception. Part of his intestine had telescoped into itself, blocking the digestive tract. Infection and death were imminent unless the blockage could be relieved. The remedy was risky. With luck the weight of a large dose of liquid mercury, which is 20 percent heavier than lead, might unravel the intestinal knot, pass through his bowels, and save Henry&#x2019;s life. If the blockage persisted, however, Henry&#x2019;s body would absorb the mercury, the muscles of his chest would fail, and he would die by suffocation.<br> <br>Family members who gathered at Red Hill that morning left a poignant record of the final conversation between the dying patriot and his physician.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose, doctor, this is your last resort,&#x201d; Henry said as he accepted the vial of mercury.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am sorry to say, governor, that it is,&#x201d; Dr. Cabell replied. &#x201c;Acute inflammation of the intestines has already taken place; and unless it is removed mortification will ensue, if it has not already commenced, which I fear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What will be the effect of this medicine?&#x201d; Henry asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It will give you immediate relief, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Cabell was unable to finish his sentence.<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean,&#x201d; Henry said, &#x201c;that it will give relief or will prove fatal immediately?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can only live a very short time without it,&#x201d; Cabell explained, &#x201c;and it may possibly relieve you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, doctor, for a few minutes,&#x201d; Henry replied, drawing his silk cap down over his eyes. Holding the vial of mercury in his hand, Henry prayed briefly for his family, his country, and himself. He swallowed the medicine and spoke quietly for a while with his family and physician. Finally he breathed &#x201c;very softly for some moments&#x201d; and died.<br> <br><br> <br>For half a dozen years Patrick Henry had regarded Red Hill, the last of the twelve places he had lived since his birth in Hanover County in 1736, as &#x201c;one of the garden spots of the world.&#x201d; Five hundred feet above sea level, the plantation&#x2019;s 2,900 acres straddled the line between Campbell and Charlotte counties. The southern vista from his house looked down on the ferry across the Staunton River and the wooded hills of Halifax County. Just beyond the southern horizon lay the Virginia&#x2013;North Carolina border, drawn in a 1728 feat of exploration celebrated in William Byrd II&#x2019;s History of the Dividing Line.<br> <br>To the north, through the window nearest the corner where he spent the last hours of his life, Henry could see a century-old osage-orange tree, which has since grown into the gnarled giant designated as an American champion for the species. Visible to his right were young figs ripening along the walkway that linked Henry&#x2019;s house and its adjacent kitchen, a small clapboard shed dominated by its massive brick fireplace and oven, with the two-room frame structure that served as his law office. There, on his desk, Patrick Henry had left two messages for posterity&#x2014;testaments both to his private religious faith and his hopes for America&#x2019;s future.<br> <br>Patrick Henry&#x2019;s will, written entirely in his own hand, provided his widow and his seventeen children with legacies sufficient to support them in comfort and independence. After disposing of his property&#x2014;including nearly eighty slaves&#x2014;Henry&#x2019;s will also conveyed a private assurance to his wife and children: &#x201c;This is all the inheritance I can give to my dear family,&#x201d; its final clause explained. &#x201c;The religion of Christ can give them one which will make them rich indeed.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the desk next to his will Henry had left a sealed envelope addressed to his executors. It contained a single sheet of paper. One side bore the text of his 1765 resolutions against the Stamp Act, which men and women of his day acknowledged as a starting point of the American Revolution. The other side offered a message to his fellow citizens that Henry knew could only be read after his death.<br> <br>Henry&#x2019;s message to posterity began with a short commentary about the past. His Stamp Act Resolutions had spread an alarm &#x201c;throughout America with astonishing Quickness,&#x201d; Henry recalled. They had successfully united the thirteen colonies behind &#x201c;the great point of resistance to British taxation&#x201d; that &#x201c;brought on the War which finally separated the two Countrys and gave Independence to ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Henry turned his thoughts toward the future&#x2014;on a subject he had been thinking about since 1765 or 1766. &#x201c;Whether [independence] will prove a Blessing or a Curse,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;will depend on the Use our people make of the Blessings which a gracious God hath bestowed on us.&#x201d; If American citizens act with wisdom, he believed, &#x201c;they will be great and happy.&#x201d; If not, he warned, &#x201c;they will be miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a Nation.&#x201d; The message closed with a final admonition:<br> <br>Reader! whoever thou art, remember this, and in thy Sphere, practice Virtue thyself, and encourage it in others.<br> <br>P. HENRY<br> <br>At his death as through his life, Patrick Henry affirmed the interaction of personal faith and civic responsibility&#x2014;Christian virtue and classical-republican virt�&#x2014;that sustained many eighteenth-century Americans.<br> <br>Patrick Henry was only sixty-three when he died, but he had outlived virtually all the leaders who had challenged Parliament and the crown in the early 1760s. John Dickinson, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, and James Otis, Jr., were dead&#x2014;as were such Virginia comrades as Richard Bland, Landon Carter, George Mason, Richard Henry Lee, and Peyton Randolph. Only three other prominent men from the very earliest controversy over the Stamp Act were still alive when Patrick Henry died: George Washington, George Wythe, and George III. Hundreds of younger American participants in the American Revolution, such as Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Gouverneur Morris, and even John Adams, were relative latecomers to the struggle against England&#x2014;as were such living Virginians as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Marshall, Edmund Pendleton, and Edmund Randolph.<br> <br>The Patrick Henry that most people remember today was the eloquent slaveholder who defied George III and Great Britain with his call for liberty or death in 1775. The spellbinding orator who insisted&#x2014;a few weeks before the patriots at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, fired the shots heard round the world&#x2014;that &#x201c;the war is actually begun!&#x201d; The man who called Virginians to arm themselves in defiance of Parliament and king by predicting that the next gale that swept from the north would &#x201c;bring to their ears the clash of resounding arms!&#x201d;<br> <br>Students of the Constitution and its ratification by the states also remember Patrick Henry, a dozen years later, as the critic whose thundering arguments nearly kept Virginia from ratifying the plan&#x2014;and whose political clout kept James Madison out of the new Senate and forced him to promise the voters a Bill of Rights and push it through Congress. The great debates of 1787&#x2013;1788 remind us again of Henry&#x2019;s long career on the center stage of American history. Of all the major participants in the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, only Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, and Benjamin Franklin had been prominent in the opposition to the Stamp Act a quarter of a century earlier.<br> <br>Throughout his life, Patrick Henry adhered to a cluster of five tactical ideas that drove him and his neighbors first to resist and then to declare themselves independent of Great Britain. He believed that the burgesses and councilors who comprised Virginia&#x2019;s legislative assembly spoke for the people of Virginia just as members of the House of Lords and House of Commons served as the constitutional legislature for the people of England, Scotland, and Wales&#x2014;and that Parliament had no legitimate authority in Virginia&#x2019;s internal government. Second, he acknowledged allegiance to the British monarch based on the compact, enshrined in the coronation oath, by which kings promised to protect their subjects in exchange for their allegiance&#x2014;and by which, as John Locke had written, a monarch who broke that promise forfeited his subjects&#x2019; allegiance and degenerated from a king into a tyrant. Third, Henry believed that the protection of American liberty demanded unanimity between the people of Virginia and their compatriots in the other colonies or states. Fourth, Henry recognized the necessity of invoking sanctions against enemies of the community in defense of liberty and the common good. And finally, Henry genuinely respected the will of the people when expressed fairly through democratic institutions.<br> <br>None of these ideas was unique to Henry, and many other ideas figured prominently in his life and career (including concepts of liberty, equality, rule of law, freedom of conscience, religious toleration, representation, federalism, separation of powers, and the list of republican virtues he enshrined in the Virginia Declaration of Rights: justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, virtue, and a &#x201c;frequent recurrence to fundamental principles&#x201d;). In support of these and other civic principles, nevertheless, the five tactical elements sustained Patrick Henry&#x2019;s course during Virginia&#x2019;s transition from the oldest and largest of Great Britain&#x2019;s American colonies when he was born in 1736 to the largest and arguably still most influential of the American states when he died in 1799.<br> <br>When Patrick Henry left the copy of his 1765 resolutions in his law office at Red Hill he was reasonably confident that his contemporaries remembered their back story and recognized their significance. Henry saw no need to explain how his words (or the five concepts behind them) had eventually &#x201c;brought on the War which finally separated the two Countrys,&#x201d; for countless Americans equated Virginia&#x2019;s resistance to the Stamp Act with the beginning of the American Revolution. Typical was the Harvard-educated author Jeremy Belknap, a founder of the Massachusetts Historical Society, who believed that his two-volume chronicle, History of New Hampshire, required this grateful nod toward Patrick Henry and the Old Dominion: &#x201c;The first proposal [for a union of the colonies] came from Virginia,&#x201d; Belknap declared, &#x201c;where American liberty was first publicly asserted when it was flagrantly violated by the stamp-act&#x201d;&#x2014;a contribution to the destiny of the Granite State for which Belknap believed &#x201c;the name of Patrick Henry will ever be illustrious.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Dorothea Dandridge Henry buried her husband at the edge of a garden east of the house and law office at Red Hill. &#x201c;Virginia has sustained a very serious loss,&#x201d; wrote John Marshall, the future chief justice, when he conveyed news of Henry&#x2019;s death to George Washington. &#x201c;Not only Virginia,&#x201d; Washington replied, &#x201c;but our country at large has sustained a very serious loss. I sincerely lament his death as a friend, and the loss of his eminent talents as a patriot.&#x201d; Thomas Jefferson and his friends kept silent, but one Richmond newspaper, the pro-Federalist Virginia Gazette, mourned the great orator. Its editor put heavy black borders around the obituary. &#x201c;As long as our rivers flow, or mountains stand,&#x201d; proclaimed the Gazette, &#x201c;Virginia&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will say to rising generations, imitate my HENRY.&#x201d; Decades later Patrick and Dorothea&#x2019;s youngest son, John, marked his father&#x2019;s grave with a marble tablet, visible today at Red Hill, with the simple inscription &#x201c;His fame his best epitaph.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrick Henry&#x2019;s fame endured throughout the nineteenth century, despite some political enmity from Jefferson and his supporters, so long as Americans continued to appreciate the powers of great oratory. But fame is fleeting&#x2014;at best a transient epitaph&#x2014;and written texts outlast spoken words. Patrick Henry could leave a copy of his Stamp Act Resolutions in his law office, and he could write a message to posterity about virtue, but some of the powerful speeches with which he made history were lost forever. Jeremy Belknap and other Americans remembered that Henry&#x2019;s resolutions had rallied the colonies to resist Great Britain in 1765 and 1775, but few Americans knew how Henry&#x2019;s earlier participation in the Parsons&#x2019; Cause of 1763 set the stage for Virginia&#x2019;s decisive reaction to the Stamp Act. And fewer still could see beyond his oratorical prowess to his frequent acts of statesmanship.<br> <br>Even today, more than two centuries after Patrick Henry&#x2019;s death, it remains true that the American Revolution in Virginia (as Richard R. Beeman wrote in 1974) &#x201c;has, surprisingly, produced numerous specialized works, but very few synthetic, interpretive books.&#x201d; And throughout those centuries, Henry&#x2019;s proper place in American history has been obscured by the popular myths concocted by his first biographer, William Wirt, in 1817. Readers who are familiar with modern scholarship about the American Revolution, or specialized studies of Virginia, or the biographies of Henry&#x2019;s famous contemporaries, will likely be surprised (as I often was while laboring to get this story right) by the accuracy of Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s grudging admission, ten years before his own death, that &#x201c;Mr. Henry&#x2019;s transcendent eminence as an Orator and Statesman, and especially his unquestioned primacy in bringing on the revolution, give him a mass of fame sufficient to satisfy any ambition.&#x201d;</p><h2>Robert Kennedy and His Times</h2><p>Private papers, letters, and journals shed new light on Kennedy family relationships and underlie an account of Robert Kennedy&#39;s private and public lives, the forces that shaped him, and his impact on the United States</p><p>Schlesinger, historian and friend of Bobby Kennedy, has had access for the first time to private papers, letters, and journals which make possible a fresh look at both personal relationships and public events.

Also on this cassette is a witty duologue between a elderly general and his wife, played by John Mills and Peggy Ashcroft.</p><p><i>84, Charing Cross Road</i> is a charming record of bibliophilia, cultural difference, and imaginative sympathy. For 20 years, an outspoken New York writer and a rather more restrained London bookseller carried on an increasingly touching correspondence. In her first letter to Marks &amp; Co., Helene Hanff encloses a wish list, but warns, "The phrase 'antiquarian booksellers' scares me somewhat, as I equate 'antique' with expensive." Twenty days later, on October 25, 1949, a correspondent identified only as FPD let Hanff know that works by Hazlitt and Robert Louis Stevenson would be coming under separate cover. When they arrive, Hanff is ecstatic--but unsure she'll ever conquer "bilingual arithmetic." By early December 1949, Hanff is suddenly worried that the six-pound ham she's sent off to augment British rations will arrive in a kosher office. But only when FPD turns out to have an actual name, Frank Doel, does the real fun begin.<p> Two years later, Hanff is outraged that Marks &amp; Co. has dared to send an <i>abridged</i> Pepys diary. "i enclose two limp singles, i will make do with this thing till you find me a real Pepys. THEN i will rip up this ersatz book, page by page, AND WRAP THINGS IN IT." Nonetheless, her postscript asks whether they want fresh or powdered eggs for Christmas. Soon they're sharing news of Frank's family and Hanff's career.

Among generations of Latin Americans, it helped to cement the image of the United States as an arrogant, aggressive, and imperialist nation, poisoning relations between a young America and its southern neighbors.<br>&nbsp;<br>In contrast with many current books that treat the war as a fundamentally American experience, Timothy J.

In those days Mexico and the United States were very roughly comparable in size and population, and among the leadership of both countries there were enthusiasts for the ideals of progress, reason, science, and democracy. It is true that the United States was easily twice as wealthy as Mexico, but Mexicans tended to attribute this disparity to Spain's tyrannical mismanagement of its colonial economy. With independence, they expected soon to close the gap.&nbsp;In fact, however, any similarities between the two nations were superficial, while the differences were profound--and all of the differences worked to Mexico's disadvantage. Some knowledge of those differences is essential to understanding why Mexico and the United States went to war in 1846, and why that war went so disastrously for Mexico.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIFFERING LEGACIES&nbsp;The United States and Mexico had both been colonies of European powers, but they were heirs to very different colonial legacies. Britain had distanced itself far more thoroughly from the medieval heritage than had Spain: it had limited the power of its monarchy, nurtured a robust private sector, championed the impersonal rule of law, and broken the religious monopoly of the Roman Catholic Church. A good portion of the British elite embraced the ideas of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and Britain's colonists eagerly seconded that embrace. That is, many of the most prominent leaders in Britain and its colonies believed that reason should trump tradition; that progress and change should be welcomed rather than feared; that individuals should be equal before a clearly codified law and free to advance in life on the basis of merit rather than bloodlines; that sovereignty should be more or less popular and government should incorporate checks and balances as safeguards against corruption and tyranny; that wealth was not finite but was infinitely expandable through free trade, which would reward hard work and ingenuity, and that even the poor could prosper if they energetically pursued their own material self-interest; that the trend toward increasing social equality was something to be welcomed; and that citizens should be free to believe, say, and publish whatever they wished. Enthusiasm for such ideas--collectively known during the nineteenth century as "liberalism"--created a powerful bond among the ruling classes of the British Empire, one that would stand the founders of the North American republic in good stead as they forged their new nation.&nbsp;While one group of Mexican leaders greatly admired all of the enlightened notions that so captivated the founders of the United States, another group of entrenched Mexican oligarchs clung to medieval habits with a ferocious tenacity. Even if there had been a consensus that liberal ideals were desirable, conditions in Mexico made it far more difficult for the Mexicans to implement liberal policies. When the French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville praised the United States Constitution--the first instance of liberalism codified as a national charter--he described it as "one of those beautiful creations of human diligence which give their inventors glory and riches but remain sterile in other hands." To illustrate what he meant by "other hands," he asked his readers to consider the case of Mexico, which adopted a similar charter in 1824 and experienced only "anarchy" and "military despotism." To a far greater extent than Anglo-America, Hispanic America clung to a tradition where rights were defined by inherited privilege; where social inequalities were said to be established by God and were considered necessary to maintain social peace; where the king made all important decisions; where law was chaotic and readily abused; and where the economy functioned at the government's pleasure. In Mexico the colonial centuries had left a legacy perhaps too powerful to overcome, at least in the short term.&nbsp;Differences in historical tradition were accentuated by sharp differences in land and people. Despite the self-serving claims of British American colonists that they had tamed a barren wilderness, the lands of North America were of course inhabited. But the natives were too scattered, weak, and unorganized to put up successful resistance, leaving them vulnerable to ruthlessly efficient extermination or relocation at the hands of whites. Nor was there a large, settled peasantry capable of stout resistance, such as existed in both Mexico and the Old World, so individual landownership and the pursuit of enlightened self-interest encountered fewer obstacles. British North America boasted its share of land barons, but big landowners were far from holding a monopoly of land, and unlike in Mexico there was no Roman Catholic Church claiming extensive corporate property and privilege. Accordingly, in the United States wealth circulated fairly freely, and ordinary citizens could hope to gain land and opportunity.&nbsp;Few in British North America boasted titles of rank that set them much above their fellows. In contrast to the stuffy elitism of the Old World, lineage was of scant concern to the Anglo-Americans. People enjoyed differing levels of wealth and power, of course, but in general the poor in America were less poor than their Old World counterparts, and the rich were less rich. "No novelty in the United States struck me more vividly during my stay there," wrote Tocqueville in the 1830s, "than the equality of conditions. It was easy to see the immense influence of this basic fact on the whole course of society."&nbsp;Anglo-Americans tended also to believe that universal education not only inculcated the values of good citizenship but also aided economic growth and therefore should be universally available. In the early nineteenth century education was fast becoming available to all white, and even to a few black, Americans. By the 1830s the United States was among the world's most literate societies. Many Mexican leaders shared the sense that public education was vital to social health, but they encountered formidable obstacles to implementing successful educational programs, and the overwhelming majority of Mexicans remained illiterate throughout the nineteenth century.&nbsp;Of course, in the United States slaves, Indians, and indentured servants were not held to be "equal" to free white Americans, and they did not enjoy citizenship rights. The enslavement of blacks and the dispossession of Indians were glaring exceptions to nearly every principle that U.S. elites claimed to hold dear, and these original sins would nearly capsize the republican experiment. That crisis, however, remained decades away. Indentured servants, at least, would gain freedom upon fulfilling their contracts, whereupon they merged into a free white population that afforded most of them considerable opportunity. Anglo-Americans scarcely entertained the idea that Indians and blacks should enjoy full citizenship rights and so believed that their interests could blithely be ignored. The politically engaged people of the United States were ethnically homogeneous. In the first decades after independence American leaders seldom tired of pointing out, with inordinate pride, that theirs was a republic of white men.&nbsp;Mexico's social makeup was far more complicated and muddled than that of the United States, its past more violent and traumatic. Modern Mexico was born in 1521 amid the spectacular violence of the Conquest, where Spanish adventurers led by the intrepid conquistador Hern�n Cort�s laid waste to the opulent Aztec Empire, which claimed several million subjects. The capital of that empire, Tenochtitl�n, was an engineering marvel, home to some two or three hundred thousand people, more than lived in contemporary Madrid or Paris. That great city was reduced to a stinking rubble after a months-long battle. The horror and devastation of the conquest was followed by a veritable holocaust for the native population: over the ensuing decades millions of Mexico's indigenous people perished from overwork and abuse and waves of epidemic Old World disease to which they had no immunity. Even so, the indigenous population was too large and stubborn to be eradicated or removed, so the Spaniards and Indians reached certain accommodations. Spaniards were heirs to a tradition wherein the conquered were made to serve the conquerors, which fit well with their plans and culture. Spanish gentlemen eschewed manual labor, but there was plenty of manual labor to be done--in the fields, in the mines, in the carrying trades. Simply put, nonwhites became the working classes of colonial Mexico, since white skin was all it took to elevate a man to the status of New World nobility.&nbsp;For all their brutality and callousness, in fact the Spaniards were great innovators in the area of race relations. They were arguably the first people to seriously ponder the implications of intercultural contact on a vast scale. Yet while learned clerics at Spain's universities debated the worth of the Indian race, their counterparts, the bold missionaries to the New World, were busy carrying out an experiment in social engineering that, although done with compassionate intentions, had unfortunate consequences that are still felt today. They deemed the native peoples of America to be perpetual children, fledglings whose tender wings would never permit them to leave the nest. Accordingly, they designed a paternalistic regime full of special protections and a few onerous requirements, one that inculcated dependence and a fair degree of isolation from white society. Indians held certain inalienable communal lands, lived in semiautonomous villages, had law courts designed specifically to hear their charges and complaints, were not permitted to carry guns or swords, could not enter the priesthood or other professions, were not permitted to borrow more than five pesos, and were required to pay a race-based head tax. Relying on such blatant paternalism, the friars hoped to protect the Indians as far as possible from the corrupting influence of white civilization.&nbsp;In some ways they succeeded all too well. Indians lived in self-governing villages; most did not learn Spanish or adopt many Spanish ways; they were able to preserve many of their pre-Columbian beliefs and practices, albeit in somewhat distorted forms; they remained, for the most part, desperately poor and outside the market economy; and their interactions with people from outside their culture were limited and characteristically hostile. All of this remained largely true as Mexico entered the nineteenth century and the era of its independent existence. Policymakers in Mexico thus confronted obstacles that their neighbors to the north did not. The Indians, who accounted for perhaps about 60 percent of the population, were unassimilated, illiterate, and unable to speak what white elites deemed to be the national language. One writer at the time of the U.S.-Mexican War reckoned that perhaps three-quarters of Mexico's indigenous population had not yet heard the news of Mexico's independence from Spain.&nbsp;Some 22 percent of Mexico's population consisted of castas, a generic term for people of mixed race. The conquistador Hern�n Cort�s himself had helped kick off this trend by fathering an illegitimate son by his Indian interpreter, Do�a Marina (better known to history as La Malinche). Other conquistadors and early settlers followed suit, bringing into being a class of mestizos, persons of mixed Indian and European blood. Adding to the racial mix were enslaved Africans, brought to work in the mines and on sugar plantations. Blacks, in turn, produced offspring with Indians and whites. (In Mexico such offspring were called zambos and mulattos respectively.) In a country that was in theory sharply divided by race--there was a "Republic of Spaniards" and a "Republic of Indians"--the castas fit into no officially recognized category. For the three hundred years of the Spanish colony, they inhabited the uncomfortable margins of society, with few opportunities for advancement. Only one institute of higher learning in all of Mexico admitted castas, the undistinguished Colegio de San Juan de Letr�n, where the meager curriculum included courses in how to beg for alms.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, castas tended toward fairly menial occupations: they became artisans, muleteers, hacienda overseers, domestic servants, and market vendors. The more they tried to gain respect and social standing, the more the whites insisted on their own racial "purity." In the late colonial era whites took to devising rather bizarre new racial designations based on the intricate intermingling of white, Indian, and African blood. The closer those mixtures came to whiteness, the more respectable they became, but it was never quite possible to erase the stain of nonwhite blood in the eyes of the white elite. By the time of Mexico's independence, castas were the fastest-growing element of the Mexican population, yet their status remained oddly undetermined. Their pretensions to power and respect would provoke some of the most gruesome episodes in the history of the early Mexican Republic.&nbsp;Mexico's racial situation, then, was a good deal more complex than that of the United States. There was one blessing: by the end of the colonial era Mexico had relatively few enslaved blacks (some eight thousand, perhaps), most of them concentrated in the torrid coastal regions. The institution of slavery was entirely negligible to Mexico's economy. Mexico therefore was able to suppress that institution with relative ease, affording it one of its few advantages over its northern neighbor.&nbsp;This single blessing, however, did not make Mexico's racial sins any less damning than those of the United States. The Indians and the castas suffered grotesque marginalization and poverty. Nineteenth-century visitors to Mexico City, who arrived expecting to experience the fabled elegance of the old colonial capital, were inevitably scandalized by the sight of thousands of dark-skinned people living out of doors and in the most appalling squalor: clad in dirty rags, covered with frightful sores and wounds, living from crime or begging. The well-to-do residents of the capital developed a colorful lexicon of disparaging terms to describe these despised people: los l�peros, la canalla, los sansculottes, la chusma, el populacho--all translating, with varying shades of emphasis, to "the rabble." Brantz Mayer, who served as secretary of the U.S. legation in Mexico during the 1840s, left a vivid portrait of the famed Mexican l�pero, with his long, vermin-infested hair, torn and stinking clothing, wild eyes, and "features pinched by famine into sharpness." Such people spent their days around the markets and shops that sold pulque--the fermented juice of the century plant that was the intoxicant of choice among Mexico's poor--"feeding on fragments, quarreling, drinking, stealing and lying drunk about the pavements, with their children crying with hunger around them."&nbsp;The relatively better-off working people of the city--who were mostly mestizo and were generally included in the category of "rabble"--tended to live in first-floor apartments that routinely flooded during the rainy season, contributing to a shockingly high mortality rate.

Rather than contending for privilege by wielding power and authority, we can witness prophetically from a position of weakness. The church has much to learn from an often overlooked community--those with disabilities. In this fascinating book, theologian Stanley Hauerwas collaborates with Jean Vanier, founder of the worldwide L&#39;Arche communities. For many years, Hauerwas has reflected on the lives of people with disability, the political significance of community, and how the experience of disability addresses the weaknesses and failures of liberal society. And L&#39;Arche provides a unique model of inclusive community that is underpinned by a deep spirituality and theology. Together, Vanier and Hauerwas carefully explore the contours of a countercultural community that embodies a different way of being and witnesses to a new order--one marked by radical forms of gentleness, peacemaking and faithfulness. The authors&#39; explorations shed light on what it means to be human and how we are to live. The robust voice of Hauerwas and the gentle words of Vanier offer a synergy of ideas that, if listened to carefully, will lead the church to a fresh practicing of peace, love and friendship. This invigorating conversation is for everyday Christians who desire to live faithfully in a world that is violent and broken.</p><p>For more information, visit Duke Divinity School's Center for Reconciliation. <p>To learn more about Jean Vanier's work with the disabled community, visit L'Arche.</p>Stanley Hauerwas (Ph.D., Yale University) is Gilbert T.

That role, reports Howard French, has been set aside. China has asserted its place among the global heavyweights, revealing its plans for pan-Asian dominance by building its navy, increasing territorial claims to areas like the South China Sea, and diplomatically bullying smaller players. Underlying this attitude is a strain of thinking that casts China's present-day actions in decidedly historical terms, as the path to restoring the dynastic glory of the past. If we understand how that historical identity relates to current actions, in ways ideological, philosophical, and even legal, we can learn to forecast just what kind of global power China stands to become--and to interact wisely with a future peer. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Steeped in deeply researched history as well as on-the-ground reporting, this is French at his revelatory best.</p><p><b>HOWARD W.

But in Okinawa, even from the air there is no escaping how incomplete, or even deceptive, this widely accepted picture is. Upon our final approach before landing in Naha, three of Japan&#x2019;s white Self-Defense Force (SDF) fighters, spooling contrails in their wake, darted parallel to us in formation. Down below, both at dock and at sea, were SDF coast guard cutters and other smaller ships whose white hulls stood out against the placid-looking blue carpet of the Pacific.<br><br>Okinawa is the island where American-led Allied forces famously launched their ferocious invasion of Japan in early April 1945, losing 14,000 personnel while killing at least five times as many Japanese soldiers, along with between 42,000 and 150,000 civilians. Okinawa was captured in order to serve as the springboard for what would have been a far more challenging assault on Japan&#x2019;s so-called home islands, aimed at capturing Tokyo or forcing surrender. As it happened, the war was brought to an end by the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that August. This hardly meant the end of the American story on Okinawa.<br><br>The Americans never left. Over the next seven decades the island became the most important anchor of American power in the Western Pacific, enabling the United States to hedge, or balance, seemingly indefinitely against China, whose mainland lay a mere four hundred miles to the west. From the perspective of the locals, that has made it the unhappy home of about 63 percent of the roughly twenty-five thousand American troops who are permanently stationed in Japan, despite the fact that Okinawa makes up less than 1 percent of Japan&#x2019;s total landmass.<br><br>On the connecting flight to Yonaguni, we strung our way along a necklace of tiny islands that drooped off to the southwest from Okinawa, first past Miyako, then Iriomote and then an assemblage of smaller others&#x2014;some flat as pancakes and patterned in the green geometric fields of commercial agriculture, others darkly mountainous, their coral approaches ringed by encroaching circular tides. Most of the visitors who come this way are drawn by great surfing or diving or the prospect of a rustic nature retreat, all of which these islands offer in abundance. The specks of land below are of greater interest, however, because they have served as interstitial tissue in the ebb and flow of empires, and today are the focus of an enormous geopolitical contest that has recently resumed in this part of East Asia. It was here, in this watery realm, that China, drawing on a combination of newfound wealth and power and some impatience, was girding for a showdown with Japan, the neighbor that had most persistently defied it over the past thirteen centuries.<br><br>For hundreds of years this string of islands, often collectively referred to simply as Okinawa, a name that fittingly means &#x201c;a rope in the offing,&#x201d; had been the quasi-independent kingdom of Ryukyu. Throughout much of that time, for China, this tiny monarchy had mostly served as a reminder of the nuisances of the tribute system, because the hospitality costs associated with hosting frequent visits by embassies from such a small vassal state were far out of proportion to the value of bilateral trade, so much so that Beijing made little noise about its loss when Japan annexed the islands in 1879. At altitude on a cloudless day, though, it is easy to understand how important an impediment the Ryukyus may now seem to be for the global aspirations of a rising power that sees itself as increasingly entitled.<br><br>In its entirety, Japan takes the shape of an elongated archipelago, a gently curved scythe stretching all the way from the icy ports of Russia south to the doorstep of semitropical fringes of the South China Sea. For the purposes of maritime navigation, the archipelago serves as an immense picket fence that looms off of China&#x2019;s shores, restricting access to the open waters of the Pacific to a handful of easily guarded choke points. At its southern end, at Yonaguni, the westernmost point of Japan, it also comes within eyesight of Taiwan, just sixty-two miles distant. For this reason, and for reasons of history as well, the Ryukyus have come to powerfully concentrate China&#x2019;s attention. It is here that this fence is at once its most fragile and strategic, sitting astride critical sea lanes connecting southern China and the vast blue waters of the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>During China&#x2019;s nearly four decades of recent resurgence, Japan has represented many things to Beijing. Early in China&#x2019;s opening-up period, it was, as noted, an important source of investment, especially during the 1980s. For the second time in its modern history, China saw Japan as a country that it could study and learn from economically and copy selectively as it modernized. Shortly thereafter, as an accelerating China began to pile up successes, Japan became a benchmark to be overtaken in order to affirm that China&#x2019;s destiny had been redeemed and its true potential was being realized. Although China remains far poorer on a per capita basis, an important milestone was crossed along this path in 2009, when it displaced its neighbor to become the world&#x2019;s second-largest economy.<br><br>But in modern times economics has represented only one dimension of the deeply competitive dynamic between the two countries. Despite its unique &#x201c;peace constitution,&#x201d; a legacy of its World War II defeat and American occupation, Japan is inescapably seen by Beijing as a major military rival supported by a sixty-year-old alliance with the United States, and it must be overcome if China is to recover the status it regards as its due in the region. This was stated with striking baldness even for a frequently bombastic Beijing-based newspaper, the nationalist Global Times. In a September 2014 editorial, it declared, &#x201c;We should try to gain overwhelming advantages over Japan in major areas. Tokyo only shows respect to countries that have once heavily struck it or possess much greater strategic ability.&#x201d; And since the early years of this century, a campaign to demonstrate this greater capability has been under way, with China sending coast guard, fishing patrol vessels, and even naval ships into the surrounding waters of the Ryukyu chain, as well as aircraft into the skies overhead, both to challenge its neighbor&#x2019;s claims to sovereignty over the islands and to wear Japan down.<br><br>Had it been a theatrical production, this resumed contest between Japan and China could have been titled &#x201c;The Revenge of History.&#x201d; Its chief protagonist was a revitalized China, as energized and motivated as an aggrieved legal plaintiff in a liability case freshly recovered from a severe injury caused by the other party&#x2019;s willful misconduct. And the interim award for damages that it seeks to recover consists of a group of five small islands and three barren rocks, collectively known as the Senkaku Islands, which are adjacent to but geologically distinct from the Ryukyus. Japan has controlled this uninhabited real estate since it annexed the Senkakus in 1895, which may seem like a long time by the standards of the familiar international system that governs our world, but is of course a mere blink of the eye in China&#x2019;s long history. Chinese imperial records mention the islands as a well-known navigational marker on the seafarers&#x2019; route to the Ryukyu kingdom as early as the fifteenth century. But even more important to an aggrieved China is the timing of Japan&#x2019;s annexation of the islands following its defeat of China, accelerating the collapse of the age-old Sinocentric world.<br><br>Yonaguni measures a bare eleven square miles, and its only real town is Sonai. Outside Sonai, one could go for hours without encountering another person. When I visited the island I made a brief stop at a horse farm to ask for directions. There, I struck up a conversation with a worker. He eagerly briefed me on what for him was clearly rare big news. The Japanese government had made a locally unpopular decision to build a radar station on Yonaguni, along with a billet for its newly constituted marines, he said. He pointed to a dramatic escarpment in the near distance where the station was to be built. &#x201c;Most people here don&#x2019;t want a base on this island,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But for quick deployment there is surely no better location.&#x201d;<br><br>Actually, I had already read items in the Japanese press saying that tiny Yonaguni was being put into play in a major way in an intensifying renewal of a competition between Tokyo and Beijing whose origins lay fourteen hundred years in the past. At that time, a Japanese empress named Suiko sent an &#x201c;embassy&#x201d; to the Sui dynasty capital, Chang&#x2019;an, led by a diplomat bearing a letter informing the Chinese court, in effect, that in protocol terms Japan would no longer be content to play the role of an ordinary vassal and considered itself to be on equal footing with the Central Kingdom.<br><br>One way to understand the Japanese move to build an early warning station and rapid response base on Yonaguni is simply to regard it as the latest reenactment of this flintiness; a firm and very public statement that Tokyo would not be intimidated by China&#x2019;s size, its might or its bluster. But unlike in the past, when flintiness was cushioned by the two countries&#x2019; coexistence as neighbors with limited contact, now they lived edgily in almost promiscuous closeness.<br><br>Another way to view it, however, is simply as prudence. A few months after my visit to Yonaguni, another confirmation of its special place in the looming struggle between Japan and China was delivered by James Fanell, director of intelligence for the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Speaking at a Navy conference in San Diego, Fanell made a surprisingly blunt pronouncement about Beijing&#x2019;s designs on the area, citing its large-scale military exercises in 2013 to claim that China was preparing for a &#x201c;short, sharp war to destroy Japanese forces in the East China Sea, following with what can only be an expected seizure of the Senkakus.&#x201d;<br><br>Captain Fanell&#x2019;s comments were immediately criticized by many in the foreign policy community for their alarmism, and a few months later he was quietly forced into early retirement. But looking at Beijing&#x2019;s actions in the waters of the East China Sea, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that either China is preparing to do just as Fanell said, or it wishes to instill fear in the minds of the Japanese, and most likely of the Americans too, of such an eventuality.<br><br>Since 2010, the narrow seas between the two countries have seen a severe ratcheting up of pressure on Japan as Beijing has used a range of steadily more assertive tactics. In January 2013, a Chinese frigate locked its firing radar on a Japanese destroyer, an action that is customarily taken as a threat of imminent use of force, especially in an encounter between unfriendly countries in contested territory. Under circumstances like these, it is not hard to imagine how a conflict between the two nations could easily break out by accident, as when two fighter aircraft or opposing coast guard vessels collide, with a loss of life.<br><br>There are precedents for such dangerous mishaps. The United States and China were plunged into a major bilateral crisis under circumstances like this in 2001, when a Chinese fighter pilot died in a crash after bumping a U.S. Navy EP-3E surveillance aircraft gathering signals intelligence just off the Chinese coast, seventy miles from Hainan Island. The very large power differential between China and the United States at the time prevented military retaliation by Beijing, confining the damage to diplomatic relations.<br><br>The gap in power between China and Japan in the contested seas that separate them, however, is much narrower, with Japan widely presumed to hold a tenuous and increasingly vulnerable lead. Practically, this means that even if China has not chosen this as quite the right moment for a direct confrontation, it could prove very hard or indeed impossible for it to back down after a fatal accident, particularly one in which it came off as the initial loser. The main reason for this is history&#x2014;past history as well as the making of a new and future one.<br><br>After taking power in November 2012, Xi Jinping wasted little time setting the tone for his expected ten-year tenure in office. His first trip outside of the capital was to visit troops in the Guangzhou Military Region, telling them that &#x201c;being able to fight and win wars is the soul of a strong army.&#x201d; A few months later, just before it began operations, he toured China&#x2019;s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, which had been purchased from Ukraine and refurbished. None of this early military signaling by Xi would have been remarkable had it not been accompanied by an increasingly full-throated state campaign of vengeful nationalism.<br><br>As anniversaries go, seventy-seven doesn&#x2019;t have a very special ring, not in China nor in any other culture. But in July 2014, that didn&#x2019;t discourage Xi from presiding over the largest ever commemoration of what is officially known as the War of Resistance Against Japan, which China says began with the Marco Polo Bridge incident, a showdown with Japanese troops just outside Beijing in 1937. It was as if he couldn&#x2019;t wait for a chance to exploit anti-Japanese feelings. In his speech, Xi denounced Japanese whitewashing of the past, and vowed that the &#x201c;Chinese people who have sacrificed . . . will unswervingly protect, with blood and life, the history and the facts.&#x201d; At the conclusion of his remarks, the crowds of Chinese youth gathered for the event gave it a Maoist hue, collectively chanting, &#x201c;Never forget national humiliation! Realize the Chinese dream!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Chinese dream of great national rejuvenation&#x201d; was how Xi often put it. It is the kind of watchword or slogan that Chinese leaders since Mao have adopted, drawing on an imperial tradition of reign slogans. But where most of Mao&#x2019;s successors have waited several years, even until the second of what is traditionally a mandate of two five-year terms, before announcing the organizing thought behind their presidency, Xi proclaimed his from the very start. The Marco Polo commemoration was by no means a one-off, either. Under Xi, a spate of other propaganda initiatives have been regularly orchestrated with the aim of reviving and channeling popular ire toward Japan.<br><br>In January 2014, the northeastern city of Harbin opened a memorial hall for the Korean independence activist Ahn Jung-geun, who assassinated Japan&#x2019;s first prime minister, Hirobumi Ito, in 1909. The following month, two new national holidays were introduced, both of them focused on Japan: the &#x201c;War Against Japanese Aggression Victory Day&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day.&#x201d; For good measure, the government commissioned the $6 million construction of a full-size replica of an eighty-meter-long warship sunk by Japan during the Sino-Japanese War, intended as a reminder to the Chinese people of their country&#x2019;s defeat in that conflict.</p><h2>La Varenne Pratique</h2><p>Unprecedented in both scope and clarity, La Varenne Pratique is destined to become the essential culinary reference for both novice cook and expert.

Her childhood was loving and secure, his turbulent: the Duke's grandfather was assassinated, his father arrested, his family exiled, his parents separated by the time he was ten. For almost sixty years theirs have been among the most famous faces in the world&#x2014;yet the personalities behind the image remain elusive and the nature of their marriage is an enigma.<br><br>Gyles Brandreth has met all the principal players in the story; he quotes no anonymous sources; he has known the Duke of Edinburgh for twenty-five years and has interviewed him. This is a unique and revealing portrait of a remarkable partnership, told with candor and authority, and illustrated with Prince Philip's family photographs and pictures from the Queen's royal collection. 40 pages of illustrations.</p><p>Broadcaster, interviewer, novelist, children's author, and biographer <b>Gyles Brandreth</b> has been involved in the work of the National Playing Fields Association, whose patron is the Queen and whose president is the Duke of Edinburgh, for twenty-five years. He lives in England.Princess Elizabeth fell for Prince Philip in 1939, when she was 13 and he, 18. But though Philip was a direct descendent of Queen Victoria, some at court thought him an unsuitable match. But as longtime royal acquaintance Brandreth shows, Philip has been the perfect mate: dutiful, loyal, hard-working and deeply respectful. As Brandreth makes clear, the marriage has succeeded not only because Philip loves his wife, but because he understands the nature of royal life. Social and outgoing, Philip balances the queen's reserve. He's also likely the only person who has ever threatened her and gotten away with it: Brandreth relates how Philip grew so fed up with his wife's wordless but potent backseat driving that he told her to stop or he'd put her out of the car. She stopped. Brandreth goes to great and mostly convincing lengths to disprove rumors of the Prince's extramarital affairs and the queen's tendency to lavish more affection on her corgis and horses than on her family. But the biggest surprise here is the portrayal of the royal couple as typical married folks: the prince thinks the queen spends too much time on the telephone, and she has no qualms about telling him to shut up. 40 pages of illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1944, the United States finally acted. That year, Franklin D. Roosevelt created the War Refugee Board, and put a young Treasury lawyer named John Pehle in charge.&nbsp;<br><br> Over the next twenty months, Pehle pulled together a team of D.C. pencil pushers, international relief workers, smugglers, diplomats, millionaires, and rabble-rousers to run operations across four continents and a dozen countries. Together, they tricked the Nazis, forged identity papers, maneuvered food and medicine into concentration camps, recruited spies, leaked news stories, laundered money, negotiated ransoms, and funneled millions of dollars into Europe. They bought weapons for the French Resistance and sliced red tape to allow Jewish refugees to escape to Palestine. In this remarkable work of historical reclamation, Holocaust historian Rebecca Erbelding pieces together years of research and newly uncovered archival materials to tell the dramatic story of America&#x2019;s little-known efforts to save the Jews of Europe.</p><p>REBECCA ERBELDING is an archivist, curator, and exhibition research historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. She has a Ph.D. in American history from George Mason University. She and her work have been profiled in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, NPR, and other outlets.<p>1</p><p><i>Two Wars</i></p><p>Nazi Germany fought two simultaneous wars: the military war against the Allies and the genocidal war against the Jews. It launched the first on September&nbsp;1, 1939, riding roughshod over Poland and daring the British and French to protest. Americans argued for more than two years over whether to join the conflict, before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ended the debate. The second war began in 1941 when a decade of racial and religious persecution morphed into a plan to annihilate the Nazis&#x2019; innocent enemies. The U.S. government confirmed the ongoing mass murder in 1942, and for more than a year Americans&#x2014;�to the extent they were paying attention&#x2014;�debated how and whether to respond. Finally, in 1944, the United States began fighting the second war.</p><p>On a drizzly Sunday in the middle of January, John Pehle, a young assistant to the secretary of the Treasury, walked from his office to the White House at lunchtime, and when he emerged, the United States had entered the war against the Nazi extermination of European Jews. When the war in Europe ended seventeen months later, tens of thousands of people&#x2014;�Jewish and non-�Jewish&#x2014;�were alive due to the outcome of Pehle&#x2019;s meeting: a new government agency, the War Refugee Board (WRB), had been born. Pehle and his colleagues never became famous and spent the rest of their lives hearing&#x2014;�and agreeing&#x2014;�that the United States should have done more to help save the Jews of Europe. At the same time, few people ever knew what the War Refugee Board had actually done.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The odds that day&#x2014;�January&nbsp;16, 1944&#x2014;�were stacked against John Pehle.</p><p>President Franklin Roosevelt had the flu. Rumors flew around official Washington about his ill health, a topic of particular concern because the Democratic National Committee met that weekend to debate nominating him for an unprecedented fourth term. The president felt physically weak and postponed things he wasn&#x2019;t up to doing.</p><p>Pehle, a tall midwesterner with a deep voice and light brown hair already starting to recede, had never had an official White House meeting, even though he had worked in Washington for a decade, rising through the ranks at the Treasury Department. Since 1940, when he was just thirty-�one, Pehle had overseen Foreign Funds Control, responsible for keeping billions of dollars out of the hands of America&#x2019;s enemies. With a staff of nearly fifteen hundred, Foreign Funds Control also supervised the small amounts of relief money sent from the United States into Europe. This did not exactly qualify Pehle, or any of his colleagues, as humanitarian aid specialists.</p><p>Many people, including military officials, believed the United States could only truly help the victims of the Nazis and their collaborators by winning the war as soon as possible. Everything else was a distraction and a diversion of resources. Pehle thought they could do more than just fight militarily, but would Roosevelt?</p><p>Most worryingly, Pehle&#x2019;s news would undoubtedly upset the president. His friends had been lying to him, and Pehle&#x2014;�a man Roosevelt couldn&#x2019;t have picked out of a lineup&#x2014;�had the proof. Pehle&#x2019;s plan&#x2014;�an incredibly risky one&#x2014;�was to argue that if the president did not act immediately and follow the Treasury Department&#x2019;s advice, his legacy as a defender of the downtrodden would be forever marred. Millions had already died, but millions of lives were still at stake. Pehle felt convinced that some could still be saved, but only if Roosevelt acted quickly.</p><p>Pehle entered the White House, stomped his shoes clean, hung up his hat and coat, still damp with wintry drizzle, and climbed the stairs to the president&#x2019;s private study. He readied himself for the most important meeting of his life.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>In the summer of 1942, a year and a half before Pehle&#x2019;s meeting, news of the ongoing massacre of the Jews began to reach the United States. Most Americans had known that Nazi Germany made life impossible for Jews, but the idea of a systematic mass murder plan seemed absurd. And even if it was true, what could Americans do about it? Helping refugees escape Europe had never been a priority for the American government or the American people. Bigger problems&#x2014;�the Great Depression, war in Europe, war in Asia&#x2014;�stole most Americans&#x2019; focus. Restrictive immigration laws instituted in the 1920s hadn&#x2019;t been written to target German Jews&#x2014;�and were in place long before the refugee crisis began in the late 1930s&#x2014;�but as a result of these laws many thousands of people who might have been able to escape couldn&#x2019;t do so. They were still in Europe waiting for immigration visas when they were rounded up and murdered by the Nazis.</p><p>The doors to the United States began to close in the 1920s. The Johnson-�Reed Act of 1924, which passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support, was born from intense postwar isolationism and eugenic theories. The law capped the number of immigrants from outside the Western Hemisphere at about 154,000 people per year, a far cry from the more than 10&nbsp;million who had arrived in the United States in the decade prior to World War&nbsp;I. The act also applied &#x201c;national origins&#x201d; quotas and categorized applicants based on country of birth, not country of residence or citizenship. The quotas severely restricted persons from southern and eastern Europe, who had formed the majority of the immigrant population in recent decades, and kept most Asian and African people out entirely. Countries with large populations of Jews, Slavs, and people thought to be racially undesirable, poorer, and harder to assimilate were specifically targeted. Great Britain had the largest quota, and Germany was second, with a cap of 25,957.</p><p>The 1924 law also moved power over immigration to the State Department. Though the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) stayed in the Labor Department until June 1940, applicants for immigration visas had to present all their paperwork&#x2014;�identification, financial records, medical exams&#x2014;�to State Department officers at designated consulates around the world. Immigrants received their visas before leaving Europe, so Ellis Island became merely a holding area for illegal or sick passengers. As ships steamed past the Statue of Liberty, those on board could wave with ease; the hardest part of the process was already over.</p><p>Then, in 1929, the Great Depression hit the United States and the world.</p><p>As had happened before and has happened since, politicians blamed immigration for exacerbating American economic problems. President Herbert Hoover instructed the State Department to strictly interpret an obscure clause from a 1917 law about people &#x201c;likely to become a public charge.&#x201d; Visa applicants who did not have sufficient financial resources were no longer eligible, because one could not assume they would ever find employment in America. The year before Hoover&#x2019;s restriction, 25,957 German immigrants entered, completely filling the quota allotment. By 1933, the number had fallen to 1,324.</p><p>On March&nbsp;4, 1933, when Franklin Roosevelt recited the oath of office, the front pages of major newspapers reported on his laundry list of New Deal legislation but also on increasing antisemitism in Nazi Germany, where a new chancellor, Adolf Hitler, had taken power five weeks earlier. Jews were being kicked out of their jobs, stores boycotted, books burned. In protest, tens of thousands of Americans marched in major cities around the country, held rallies, and began an anti-�German boycott movement.</p><p>Roosevelt&#x2019;s State Department staff, still settling into the massive Department of State building just west of the White House, felt that diplomatic tensions were too fraught to make any formal protest. Germany owed American investors $2&nbsp;billion in loans after World War&nbsp;I, and the new Nazi regime acted on whims. Germany was a sovereign nation, and anyway it was not a crime to persecute your own citizens.</p><p>From Berlin, the U.S. consul general George Messersmith sent a warning to his colleagues in Washington in June 1933: The persecution of the Jews &#x201c;is one of the most serious and one of the saddest problems that has arisen in a civilized country in modern times&nbsp;. . . I personally can see no hope for the Jews in Germany for years to come and all those who can possibly get out of the country, will wish to do so.&#x201d;</p><p>In the first full year of Nazi control, fewer than 4,400 Germans had been granted U.S. immigrant visas, while 83,013 persons, mostly Jews, sat on the waiting list. The State Department loosened the &#x201c;likely to become a public charge&#x201d; instruction and reminded consular officials to be sympathetic. Otherwise, the process stayed the same. The United States had an immigration policy, but no refugee policy. Those fleeing persecution had to qualify, with the same paperwork and under the same strict rules as everyone else. Soon, Nazi persecution stopped being front-�page news, and most Americans stopped paying attention.</p><p>Five years later, on March&nbsp;12, 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria in a territorial grab known as the <i>Anschluss.</i> Hitler rode triumphantly through Vienna, with swastika flags hanging from every building and people lining the streets to cheer. There were 1,413 immigration spots available under the Austrian quota each year, but the consulate had been a sleepy one, issuing only an average of 15 per month prior to the Nazis&#x2019; arrival. In the next four months, 40,000 Austrians applied, the vast majority of them Jews. Between 500 and 4,000 people waited in the gardens outside the consulate every day for an appointment with the small&#x2014;�and now frantic&#x2014;�State Department staff. Eight hundred letters arrived every day, all needing responses. The desperate Jews of Vienna were being evicted from their homes and constantly threatened with arrest and imprisonment in concentration camps. Suicide grew increasingly common.</p><p>Though the State Department controlled the issuance of visas, Congress determined immigration law and set the quotas. In the spring of 1938, three Democrats, all representing parts of Brooklyn, proposed bills to assist refugees. Samuel Dickstein wanted to carry over unused quota slots from year to year, reassigning them to countries according to need; Emanuel Celler wanted to remove the &#x201c;public charge&#x201d; consideration entirely for those escaping persecution; and Donald O&#x2019;Toole thought that all physically and mentally healthy refugees should be granted visas. Hearings on their bills were scheduled for April&nbsp;20&#x2013;��22, 1938.</p><p>Before they could take place, Messersmith, now assistant secretary of state, made the trip down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol at Celler&#x2019;s request. After the hearings had been scheduled, both Messersmith and Celler had heard from frantic refugee advocates, all warning that the bills were dangerous. They shouldn&#x2019;t hold any debate regarding immigration, Messersmith warned the Jewish congressmen gathered in Celler&#x2019;s office, not in committee and definitely not on the House floor. Immigration was simply too unpopular, and any proposal to increase the quotas would likely result in laws to cut or end immigration entirely. It was better to keep quiet and keep the quotas as they were.</p><p>The congressmen listened and argued among themselves for a long time. All were hearing from constituents, many with Jewish family members in Germany. But they made a unanimous decision: Celler would pull his bill, and Representative Adolph Sabath of Illinois would tell Dickstein and O&#x2019;Toole to do the same. No hearings, no debate. The Jewish members of Congress would not propose any new legislation to change the immigration laws. It was just too risky.</p><p>At the end of April, President Roosevelt instructed the State Department to combine the Austrian and German quotas. Though Austria no longer existed&#x2014;�the busy consulate found itself in Vienna, Germany&#x2014;�Austrians were eligible for one of the now 27,370 quota slots available to the German-�born. To most Americans, that number seemed far too high. In a Roper poll, 67&nbsp;percent of respondents felt that German, Austrian, and &#x201c;political refugees&#x201d; (non-�Jews being persecuted by the Nazis) should be kept out entirely&#x2014;�never mind the quotas. The 1937 recession had reversed some of the New Deal economic gains, and unemployment in early 1938 shot back up to 19&nbsp;percent. Many Americans were feeling sympathetic but not charitable.</p><p>To address the worsening crisis, President Roosevelt called for an international conference in �vian-�les-�Bains, France, in early July. Thirty-�two countries participated, discussing ways to assist Jews still in Germany who wanted to immigrate. But when individual countries were asked about accepting refugees, most&#x2014;�including the United States&#x2014;�demurred. Only the Dominican Republic offered to take German Jews, though the invitation wasn&#x2019;t quite an altruistic one. General Rafael Trujillo, the Dominican dictator, had initiated a massacre of poor black Haitians less than a year earlier and specifically sought to bring white wealth into his country. Rich Jews would do just fine.</p><p>The �vian Conference did have one tangible result: the formation of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees (IGC). But its work streamlining emigration met with little success. At one point, George Rublee, the seventy-�year-�old American director of the IGC, wrote to the State Department, &#x201c;With the exception of the United States, which has maintained its quota, and the British Isles, which are admitting immigrants at a current months rate equal to the rate immigrants are being admitted to the United States, doors have been systematically closed everywhere to involuntary emigrants since the meeting at �vian.&#x201d; Though the Nazis officially encouraged emigration, they demanded refugees surrender the majority of their wealth and assets first, which meant many didn&#x2019;t have the money to be desirable immigrants.</p><p>On the evening of November 9&#x2013;10, 1938, the Nazis instigated a violent pogrom known as <i>Kristallnacht</i>. The attacks and the subsequent mass arrest of Jewish men and boys received widespread press coverage in the United States&#x2014;upwards of a month of front-page newspaper stories. Roosevelt condemned the violence, adding that he &#x201c;could scarcely believe that such things could occur in a twentieth century civilization.&#x201d; The president recalled American ambassador Hugh Wilson from Berlin and announced he would extend the expiration on tourist visas for Germans&#x2014;including many Jews&#x2014;visiting the United States who did not feel safe returning home. But while a Gallup poll in the wake of <i>Kristallnacht</i> showed that 94 percent of Americans disapproved of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, this still did not translate into a public appetite for increasing the quotas.<br><br>Senator Robert Reynolds, a North Carolina Democrat, decided he would fix the immigration laws. In the six years since he had entered the Senate, Reynolds had grown more isolationist, racist, and admiring of Nazi Germany. In January 1939, the same month he started his own antisemitic newspaper, the <i>American Vindicator</i>, Reynolds introduced five bills in the Senate, all dealing with immigration. Two were particularly spiteful: immigration quotas should be cut by 90 percent, Reynolds argued, and moreover all immigration should cease for ten years or until ...</p></p><h2>The Dean&#39;s Watch: The Cathedral Trilogy</h2><p>A rich and beautiful story, set in a quiet cathedral city. When cathedral dean Adam Ayscough encounters clockmaker Isaac Peabody, their unlikely friendship touches the lives of the entire community.

Here&#x2014;in Jackson&#x2019;s own words and photographs&#x2014;is a glorious account of that months-long, problem-beset, thrilling-to-the-rattled-bones trip with his mechanic, Sewall Crocker, and a bulldog named Bud. Jackson&#x2019;s previously unpublished letters to his wife, brimming with optimism against all odds, describe in vivid detail every detour, every flat tire, every adventure good and bad. And his nearly one hundred photographs show a country still settled mainly in small towns, where life moved no faster than the horse-drawn carriage and where the arrival of Jackson&#x2019;s open-air (roofless and windowless) Winton would cause delirious excitement.<br><br>Jackson was possessed of a deep thirst for adventure, and his remarkable story chronicles the very beginning of the restless road trips that soon became a way of life in America. <b>Horatio&#x2019;s Drive</b> is the first chapter in our nation&#x2019;s great romance with the road.<br><br>With 146 illustrations and 1 map</p><p>Dayton Duncan, writer and producer of Horatio&#x2019;s Drive, is the author of seven other books about American history, including <b>Out West: A Journey Through Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s America</b>, in which he retraced the route of the expedition.

Determined to win a fifty-dollar bet, Horatio Nelson sets out with a friend in 1903 to make the first cross-country automobile trip, only to find he is in a race with competitors hoping to beat him to the punch. The soft voice of Ken Burns mixes with those of Tom Hanks and others to produce a historical American drama never told before. Flat tires, broken springs, and "gasless" delays are punctuated by the music of guitar, banjo, and John Philip Sousa from the days when many of the roadside spectators had never seen an automobile.

Trina Schart Hyman&#39;s illustrations for this retelling have earned her a place in the company of the great romantic illustrators of our time. Her work makes us feel the king&#39;s delight with his lovely daughter and profound despair at the curse that will take her from him; makes us almost smell the musty odors of the neglected castle; and, most of all, compels us to rejoice at love&#39;s triumph over the dark power of revenge.</p><p>The story of the beautiful princess who sleeps for a hundred years has captured the imaginations of children for an even longer period of time. How could everyone in a castle--even the flies on the walls--sleep for a century and then wake up? This magical, beautifully illustrated tale begins when the king excludes the most difficult fairy of the kingdom from a feast celebrating the birth of his beautiful daughter Briar Rose. Furious, the fairy storms in and curses the baby, pronouncing that on her fifteenth birthday she will be pricked by a distaff (from a spinning wheel) and fall down dead. The youngest fairy softens the curse to a century-long sleep. Despite the fact that the king burns all the spinning wheels in the kingdom, 15-year-old Briar Rose finds herself in the tower where the evil fairy and her fate await her. The drama of the spell unfurls as she and the other inhabitants of the castle fall instantly asleep, from courtiers to kitchen maids. Thorny briars--moodily captured by Trina Schart Hyman's masterful paintbrush--grow up around the castle. Hyman depicts those who died attempting to break through the maze of thorns to reach the legendary sleeping beauty in a nightmarish illustration. But goodness and true love prevail when the perfect prince does finally find his way through the thick vines.<p> Hyman won a Caldecott Medal for her work in <i>Saint George and the Dragon</i> by Margaret Hodges, and her version of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> makes us believe in the magic of the spell. The scenes inside the castle are alive with color and movement and rich with details that children will devour eagerly. Moods and expressions are rendered exquisitely, especially those of the wild, red-haired beauty Briar Rose. This wonderful read-aloud classic is one of Hyman's best. <i>(Ages 5 to 9)</i></p>Also celebrating an anniversaryAits 30thAis Whose Mouse Are You? by Robert Kraus, illus. by Jose Aruego.

As a young man, he learned the morals, manners, and knowledge necessary to become a Virginia gentleman. He was particularly interested in the military arts and western expansion. At the age of 16, he helped survey Shenandoah lands. At the age of 22, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel and fought in the first battles of what became the French and Indian War. Unanimously elected as the first President of the United States, Washington served two terms before retiring to Mount Vernon.

She<br> went on to compete in baseball, bowling, basketball, tennis, and particularly in golf. The American public was smitten with her wit, frankness, and "unladylike" bravado. She became an American legend.<br> The legend was challenged, however, by members of the press and society who insinuated that her femininity, even her femaleness, were suspect--that&nbsp;&nbsp; there was something different, even <i>wrong,</i> about this preternaturally gifted woman in a male-dominated world.<br> She had ably used her androgyny and her powerful athleticism to promote herself, but she soon felt compelled to craft herself into a more marketable female role model--particularly in connection with the "proper"<br> world of golf. To increase her opportunities for competitive play in this field, she became a co-founder and officer of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). As a major step in her makeover, Babe already<br> had married George Zaharias, a wrestling promoter who was a vital partner in her constant efforts at self-promotion.<br> But by 1950 Babe was deeply involved with a young golfer, Betty Dodd, whose for-the-record discussion of their remarkable love is included in <i>Babe.</i> Stricken with cancer in her prime, Babe went on to courageously and publicly fight the disease.<br><i>Babe</i> is a comprehensive, in-depth biography of a woman who was a great athlete at a time when it was extremely difficult for a woman&nbsp; to be her own person. Through interviews with members of Babe's family,<br> her golf peers, and medical personnel, Cayleff caringly reveals the life and probes the legend of this unusual American hero. She unflinchingly examines the athletic community, the media, and the society that both loved and judged Babe, whose story embodies the struggle of all women<br> who dare to transcend stereotypes and claim their own definitions and<br> unique identities. Babe allows her to be all the hero--and all the human<br> being--she was meant to be.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Susan E. Cayleff,</b> a professor in the Department of Women's Studies at San Diego State University, is the coeditor of <i>"Wings of Gauze": Women of Color and the Experience of Health and Illness</i> and author of <i>Wash and Be Healed: The Water-Cure Movement and Women's Health.</i><br> &nbsp;Babe Didrikson Zaharias was the premier female athlete of her era, beginning with two gold medals in the 1932 Olympics and extending through a professional golf career that ended just before her death in 1956. Cayleff, professor of women's studies at San Diego State, examines this unique life from three perspectives: Babe's life as she lived it; the public persona Babe created in order to cope with the attitudes and mores of the times; and, finally, Babe's lesbianism. Unable to acknowledge her sexuality, Babe was forced to manufacture a palatable lifestyle for public consumption; hence, her marriage to professional wrestler George Zaharias. In researching her subject, Cayleff relies on Didrikson's sanitized autobiography, subsequent biographies, newspaper accounts, and interviews with family and friends, including the woman with whom Babe shared an intimate relationship, fellow golfer Betty Dodd. The result is a groundbreaking portrait of an astute, gifted woman forced to cope with a society that grudgingly approved of her athleticism but wasn't willing to deal with her sexuality. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Holes: 10th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><p>10th Anniversary Edition</p><p>Louis Sachar received great recognition for his groundbreaking story of Stanley Yelnats &#x2013; a boy with a history of bad luck.

Such is the reigning philosophy at Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention facility where there is no lake, and there are no happy campers. In place of what used to be "the largest lake in Texas" is now a dry, flat, sunburned wasteland, pocked with countless identical holes dug by boys improving their character. Stanley Yelnats, of palindromic name and ill-fated pedigree, has landed at Camp Green Lake because it seemed a better option than jail. No matter that his conviction was all a case of mistaken identity, the Yelnats family has become accustomed to a long history of bad luck, thanks to their "no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!" Despite his innocence, Stanley is quickly enmeshed in the Camp Green Lake routine: rising before dawn to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet in diameter; learning how to get along with the <i>Lord of the Flies</i>-styled pack of boys in Group D; and fearing the warden, who paints her fingernails with rattlesnake venom. But when Stanley realizes that the boys may not just be digging to build character--that in fact the warden is seeking something specific--the plot gets as thick as the irony.<p> It's a strange story, but strangely compelling and lovely too. Louis Sachar uses poker-faced understatement to create a bizarre but believable landscape--a place where Major Major Major Major of <i>Catch-22</i> would feel right at home. But while there is humor and absurdity here, there is also a deep understanding of friendship and a searing compassion for society's underdogs. As Stanley unknowingly begins to fulfill his destiny--the dual plots coming together to reveal that fate has big plans in store--we can't help but cheer for the good guys, and all the Yelnats everywhere.

After all, his family has been ridden with bad luck ever since a one-legged gypsy put a curse on his great-great grandfather. He is told that the hard labor he must perform...digging 5 foot holes in the dried up soil where Green Lake once sat...is meant to build character. But is soon becomes clear to Stanley that the warden is really using the boys to search for something very valuable. The story of the hidden treasure, alone with the warden, Stanley's friend Zero, and the curse on the Yelnats family are all part of a compelling puzzle that has taken generations to unravel. <br><br></p><h2>The Switch: A Novel</h2><p><b>A simple mix up throws an innocent man into the cross-hairs of sinister government secrets and ruthless political ambitions in this timely, electrifying thriller from&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Joseph Finder.</b><br><br>Michael Tanner is on his way home from a business trip when he accidentally picks up the wrong MacBook in an airport security line.

He yanked his belt off, slid off his loafers, put them in the gray plastic bin and shoved it along the roller conveyor, padding along in stocking feet. He took his laptop out of his shoulder bag, put it in a gray bin of its own, watched it disappear into the maw of the X-ray machine. His jacket, too, he remembered. Pulled it off and shoved it into another gray bin. Tried not to slow down the line.<br><br>He glanced at his watch. His flight to Boston was boarding, had to be.

The man pulled out a wand of some kind and ran it around the edges of Tanner&#x2019;s bag. The wand was connected to a machine that was labeled Smiths Detection. It was obviously designed to check for traces of explosives. He waited patiently for another minute, suppressing the urge to make a crack, until the guy finally said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all set,&#x201d; and handed the bag back.<br><br>Tanner unzipped the bag, slipped his Macbook Air into it, zipped it back up, slotted his belt into his pant loops, while stepping into his shoes, resisting the urge to glance at his watch again.<br>He arrived at the gate to find no one waiting there, just a couple of airline personnel, a man and a woman, the man behind the counter and the woman next to it. &#x201c;Flight three sixty-nine?&#x201d; the woman said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right, sir, you&#x2019;re the last to arrive.&#x201d; She said it disapprovingly, like she&#x2019;d caught him smoking in the lavatory.<br><br>Finally he took his seat on the plane, sat back, exhaled.<br><br>He&#x2019;d made it; he&#x2019;d be fine; he&#x2019;d get to Boston around nine-thirty in the evening, and the next day he&#x2019;d be back at work.<br><br>Tanner was operating on a few hours of sleep. He was exhausted, so tired that he didn&#x2019;t need to take an Ambien.<br><br>He arrived at his South End house raw-eyed and headachy and punchy.<br><br>The house, five floors including the basement, seemed echoey with Sarah gone. He switched on some lights in the kitchen and, standing at the island, opened his laptop. He&#x2019;d made some notes on it he wanted to e-mail himself. The computer was off, which surprised him, because he rarely powered the thing down. Had he shut it off in the cab on the way to LAX? Maybe. Maybe he&#x2019;d spaced out. It was no big deal. He pressed the power button, and a minute later an unfamiliar screen came up: a globe and the name &#x201c;S. Robbins&#x201d; and a blank for the password.<br><br>He stared at the screen for another minute or so until the realization sank in: this wasn&#x2019;t his laptop. In the rush to grab his possessions in the security line, he&#x2019;d taken someone else&#x2019;s identical MacBook Air. Belonging to one S. Robbins.<br><br>While S. Robbins probably had his.<br><br>The perfect glitch to cap off a frustrating day.<br><br>There was a faint perfume smell to the laptop, a good and familiar white floral scent, a woman&#x2019;s perfume he&#x2019;d smelled before. S. Robbins was probably female.<br><br>Something tickled at the back of his mind, and he picked up the MacBook Air. He&#x2019;d remembered right: on the bottom of the laptop was a tiny pink square, a Post-it note.<br><br>He peeled it off the metal case and saw a jumble of letters and numbers.<br><i>342Hart342.<br></i><br>He wondered . . .<br><br>He opened the laptop again and entered the characters in the password space, and sure enough, the screen opened up with the default Apple background photo of a mountain peak.<br><br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; he said aloud. He found the Documents icon and doubleclicked it, and a column of folders came up. They had names like:<br><i>Book project<br>Chicago house<br>D.C. Condo<br>Correspondence<br>Donor Thank-yous<br>Briefing memos<br>Press releases<br>Op-Eds<br>Speeches<br>SSCI<br>Staff<br></i><br>He opened the &#x201c;Book Project&#x201d; folder and then opened the first document he came to, labeled &#x201c;Proposal 3.4.&#x201d; It began:<br><i>HONOR BOUND: Life in the Public Eye</i><br><i>By Senator Susan J. Robbins</i><br><i>After twenty-four years in the United States Senate, I&#x2019;ve learned a few hard lessons. The food in the cafeteria in the basement of the Hart Senate Office Building is&#x2014;<br></i><br>He looked up. Senator Susan J. Robbins. &#x201c;S. Robbins&#x201d; was Senator Susan Robbins. He&#x2019;d heard of her. A longtime U.S. senator from Illinois. He had a computer belonging to a U.S. senator. Huh.<br>2<br>&nbsp;<br>The baby had just fallen asleep on his mother&#x2019;s nipple.<br><br>Will Abbott lifted little Travis slowly from Jen&#x2019;s breast, and carried him carefully, gingerly, across the darkened room toward the crib as if he were transporting a hand grenade with the pin out. It could go off at any second.<br><br>Because Little Travis, six weeks old, hardly ever seemed to sleep. A few hours here and there, never more than that. And when he didn&#x2019;t sleep, his parents didn&#x2019;t sleep.<br><br>Travis had just had his last feeding for the day, or at least until he woke up at two in the morning desperately hungry again. Right now he was the angel baby, flying through the clouds, making tiny fussing sounds in his sleep. At two in the morning, or maybe three, he would awake, ravenous and loud and beyond comforting.<br><br>Jen always got up and fed him, since the baby wanted her, not him. And because Will had to go to work in the morning. Will could roll over and put a pillow over his head and fall back asleep while Jen nursed him. It was colossally unfair. Will, who worked on Capitol Hill as chief of staff to a senator, had by far the easier job. But it was also the job that paid the rent on their Stanton Park apartment.<br><br>Will was always tired, always sleep-deprived, since the baby was born. He&#x2019;d taken a month-long paternity leave&#x2014;most chiefs didn&#x2019;t get that&#x2014; during which he tried to take the baby as much as possible so Jen could catch up on sleep. But Travis always wanted his mother. Will tried putting the baby in his car seat and driving around, but that didn&#x2019;t quiet him down.<br><br>Jen&#x2019;s mom thought that Travis might have colic, but their pediatrician said colic was just an old-fashioned term for an inconsolable baby without any other obvious problem. It was probably abdominal pain, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure. He might just be a fussy baby. He was hungry a lot, but he wouldn&#x2019;t take a bottle, so they couldn&#x2019;t augment his feeding.<br><br>The room was filled with the whooshing of the white-noise generator in the corner near the baby&#x2019;s crib. The white-noise machine was Jen&#x2019;s idea. She thought it would mask traffic noise from the street.<br>Anything to keep the baby asleep a little longer.<br><br>Will walked back to the bed, avoiding the floorboard that always squeaked. When he reached the bed, his BlackBerry rang. His work phone. He kept it beside the bed, in its charger, because it rarely rang past nine at night. And if it did, it was the boss, which meant it was important.<br><br>As soon as the ringtone sounded &#x2014; he&#x2019;d forgotten to put it on vibrate mode &#x2014; Travis awoke and started to squall. From the number readout he saw it was the senator. It had to be something urgent. Otherwise, she&#x2019;d just text.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Susan,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Will, listen, I screwed up.&#x201d;<br><br>An ominous start. The boss was never self-critical, never self-blaming. She had a big ego and a maddeningly serene confidence.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said, switching into I-can-handle-anything, Mister-Fix-it mode.<br><br>&#x201c;I grabbed the wrong laptop.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At the airport. I grabbed someone else&#x2019;s laptop. In the security line. And someone got mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. You flew American, right? I&#x2019;ll call their lost-and-found at National. Whoever took it probably brought it back&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This was in L.A.&#x201d;<br><br>The baby was wailing now, so Will went out into the hall, one hand over his free ear.<br><br>&#x201c;No problem, I&#x2019;ll call&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did I wake you? You&#x2019;re not thinking clearly. The security line at LAX, Will. That means it could be anyone, on any flight, who took my laptop. Any of a thousand people. And&#x2014;&#x201d; she sighed heavily &#x2014; &#x201c;And you know damn well we can&#x2019;t call law enforcement.&#x201d;<br><br>For a moment he didn&#x2019;t know what she was talking about, and then it came to him. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br>Icy tendrils gripped the pit of his stomach. &#x201c;Oh, my God. It&#x2019;s&#x2014;it&#x2019;s password-protected, right? I mean, no one can get onto your laptop without your password. Right?&#x201d;<br><br>There was a long silence. Over the phone, Will could hear the distant clamor of airport announcements on speakers. He was about to repeat the question when she said dully, &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s password-protected.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. We don&#x2019;t have to worry about it, then.&#x201d; The icy tendrils began to melt away. In the background he heard loud babble, people talking loudly, close to her.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We have to assume the worst. We have to worry about everything as long as that computer is out there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, maybe whoever took it realized it wasn&#x2019;t hers and brought it to the lost-and-found at LAX.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she said, sounding unconvinced. &#x201c;How early can you get in tomorrow morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How early do you need me?&#x201d; Little Travis let loose with an ear-shattering, gut-churning yowl.<br><br> Will glanced at his watch. Ten minutes after ten. Putting the baby down might take another half an hour, and he knew it would be his job, not Jen&#x2019;s. If he was lucky, he&#x2019;d get three and a half hours of sleep before the inevitable two a.m. awakening, and then another two or three fitful hours. Five or six broken hours of sleep, he calculated, before what was probably going to be a long and arduous day.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you realize how sensitive this is.&#x201d; In a quieter voice, she went on, &#x201c;If anyone finds out &#x2014; it could be a felony. Not &#x2018;it could be,&#x2019; it is a felony.&#x201d;<br><br>Will felt queasy. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;d never get prosecuted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so sure. The atmosphere today, it&#x2019;s a career-ender for sure. There must be some way to hack into it, to find out who owns it, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s handled.&#x201d;<br><br></p></p><h2>Ramage&#39;s Diamond (Volume 7) (The Lord Ramage Novels, 7)</h2><p>The youngest captain in His Majesty&#39;s Navy, with a reputation for landing impossible assignments, Lord Ramage is dispatched to the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Diamond Rock.

America has pursued its enemies with killer drones and special operations troops; trained privateers for assassination missions and used them to set up clandestine spying networks; and relied on mercurial dictators, untrustworthy foreign intelligence services, and proxy armies.<br><br>This new approach to war has been embraced by Washington as a lower risk, lower cost alternative to the messy wars of occupation and has been championed as a clean and surgical way of conflict. But the knife has created enemies just as it has killed them. It has fomented resentments among allies, fueled instability, and created new weapons unbound by the normal rules of accountability during wartime.<br><br>Mark Mazzetti tracks an astonishing cast of characters on the ground in the shadow war, from a CIA officer dropped into the tribal areas to learn the hard way how the spy games in Pakistan are played to the chain-smoking Pentagon official running an off-the-books spy operation, from a Virginia socialite whom the Pentagon hired to gather intelligence about militants in Somalia to a CIA contractor imprisoned in Lahore after going off the leash.<br><br>At the heart of the book is the story of two proud and rival entities, the CIA and the American military, elbowing each other for supremacy. Sometimes, as with the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, their efforts have been perfectly coordinated. Other times, including the failed operations disclosed here for the first time, they have not. For better or worse, their struggles will define American national security in the years to come.</p><p>MARK MAZZETTI is a national security correspondent for <i>The New York Times</i>.

Theirs is a self-generating enterprise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Senator Frank Church, 1976</i></p><p>There was a time, not very long ago, when the CIA was out of the killing business.</p><p>When Ross Newland joined the spy agency, in the late 1970s, the CIA wasn&#x2019;t looking to pick any fights abroad. Newland was fresh out of graduate school, and the CIA was reeling from the body blows it had absorbed from congressional committees that had investigated the agency&#x2019;s covert actions since its founding, in 1947. Congress was tightening its control over secret activities, and chastened CIA leaders began to refocus the agency&#x2019;s activities on stealing the secrets of foreign regimes&#x2014;traditional espionage&#x2014;rather than overthrowing them or trying to kill their leaders.</p><p>President Jimmy Carter, who had campaigned to put an end to the CIA&#x2019;s overseas adventures, had installed Admiral Stansfield Turner at Langley partly to rein in a spy agency he thought had run amok. Newland and a generation of CIA case officers who joined the agency during this period were told that the CIA would only invite trouble if it got back into the work of killing. By the end of his career, Newland would see the agency come full circle on the matter of lethal action, and he would come to question the wisdom of the CIA&#x2019;s embrace of its role as the willing executioner of America&#x2019;s enemies.</p><p>The CIA had been established with a relatively simple mission: collect and analyze intelligence so that American presidents could know each day about the various threats facing the United States. President Truman had not wanted the agency to become America&#x2019;s secret army, but since a vague clause in the National Security Act of 1947 authorized the CIA to &#x201c;perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security,&#x201d; American presidents have used this &#x201c;covert action&#x201d; authority to dispatch the CIA on sabotage operations, propaganda campaigns, election rigging, and assassination attempts.</p><p>From the start, critics questioned whether the United States needed a spy service separate from the Defense Department. In defending the agency&#x2019;s independence, CIA directors have pointed out what they have that the Pentagon does not. It has a cadre of undercover officers who can carry out covert missions overseas where the hand of the United States is hidden. The CIA answers directly to the president, the argument goes, and can carry out his orders more quickly, and more quietly, than the military. The residents of the Oval Office have turned to covert action hundreds of times, and often have come to regret it. But memories are short, new presidents arrive at the White House every four or eight years, and a familiar pattern played out over the second half of the twentieth century: presidential approval of aggressive CIA operations, messy congressional investigations when the details of those operations were exposed, retrenchment and soul-searching at Langley, criticisms that the CIA had become risk-averse, then another period of aggressive covert action. Sometimes the cycle began at the very start of a presidency. During his first week in office, President John F. Kennedy told his advisers he didn&#x2019;t believe that the CIA was aggressive enough in Vietnam and set in motion a secret war against Hanoi that would eventually become the largest and most complex covert action of its time.</p><p>The CIA&#x2019;s ambivalence about carrying out assassinations went back to the spy agency&#x2019;s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services. Created in 1942 under the leadership of its fierce commander, William J. Donovan, the OSS was a paramilitary organization first, espionage service second. Donovan&#x2019;s &#x201c;glorious amateurs&#x201d; spent much of World War II sabotaging railways, blowing up bridges, and arming Nazi resisters throughout the European theater. Still, even Donovan got cold feet at the end of the war about a program to train assassins to kill Nazi leaders. By 1945, the OSS had trained about one hundred Wehrmacht deserters to hunt down German leaders&#x2014;from Adolf Hitler and Hermann G�ring down to every SS officer above the rank of captain. For those organized killings, the agents working for the &#x201c;Cross Project&#x201d; would be paid two hundred dollars per month. But the teams were never sent into Germany; Donovan wrote to his staff that such a &#x201c;wholesale assassination&#x201d; program would &#x201c;invite only trouble for the OSS.&#x201d; Instead of killing top Nazis, Donovan said that they ought to be kidnapped and interrogated for intelligence. The war ended before any kidnappings could take place.</p><p>Decades later, the Senate committee led by Frank Church, of Idaho, had originally intended to look only at domestic abuses by the agency, such as illegal wiretaps. But in early 1975, President Gerald Ford made an offhand comment to reporters, saying that if investigators dug deep enough, they might uncover a number of CIA attempts to assassinate foreign leaders. When his remarks went public, the Church Committee made assassinations the principal focus of its hearings.</p><p>For six months, senators heard about plots to kill Patrice Lumumba, in the Congo, and to position an exploding seashell near where Fidel Castro snorkeled in Cuba. The iconic image of the hearings came when committee members passed around a pistol that the CIA had built to shoot poison darts and Senator Barry Goldwater pointed the gun into the air as he looked through its sights. CIA director William Colby tried to make clear that the weapon had never been used, but the image endured. Before the committee had even wrapped up its work, President Ford signed an executive order banning the government from carrying out assassinations of foreign heads of state or other foreign politicians.</p><p>If anything, President Ford&#x2019;s assassination ban was his attempt to put limits on his Oval Office successors, to prevent future presidents from being too easily drawn into black operations. The Church Committee pointed out that, for all the CIA&#x2019;s questionable activities during its early decades, it was always the White House encouraging reckless operations like coup attempts and killing foreign leaders. The CIA offered secrecy, and secrecy had always seduced American presidents.</p><p>As Senator Church wrote in his committee&#x2019;s final report, &#x201c;once the capability for covert activity is established, the pressures brought to bear on the President to use it are immense.&#x201d; Church questioned whether America even needed the CIA at all. Instead of keeping a &#x201c;regiment of cloak-and-dagger men&#x201d; at the president&#x2019;s disposal, Church believed that the State Department would be more than capable of taking on covert operations if the need arose but should do so only in the case of dire emergency, perhaps to &#x201c;avert a nuclear holocaust or save a civilization.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>Church didn&#x2019;t get his wish, but the CIA had been duly chastened by the time that Ross Newland graduated from Trinity College, in Connecticut, in the late 1970s. The son of an international businessman, he had spent most of his life living in Latin America and Spain, and spoke fluent Spanish. Given his upbringing and interest in international affairs, Newland figured that he might be destined for a career as a diplomat, but he chose first to pursue a master&#x2019;s degree at the London School of Economics.</p><p>At an opulent holiday party in December 1978, at the residence of the American ambassador in Madrid, Newland was recruited to become a spy. He had flown from London to Madrid to see his parents, who were living in Spain, and during the party a man in his early fifties approached him and told him he worked at the embassy. After fifteen minutes of small talk, in both English and Spanish, the man asked Newland if he wanted to walk through the gardens of the residence and speak in private.</p><p>The man was Nestor Sanchez, the CIA&#x2019;s station chief in Madrid and a veteran clandestine officer whose storied career in the secret service was in its twilight. An ardent anticommunist, Sanchez had joined the CIA not long after its founding and had been at the center of many of the covert operations investigated by the Church Committee. He had helped engineer the successful 1954 coup against Jacobo �rbenz Guzm�n, in Guatemala, and had given a poison-filled syringe disguised as a writing pen to a Cuban agent in an attempt to kill Castro.</p><p>Sanchez told Newland he might make a good CIA case officer and gave his name to the agency&#x2019;s station in London. Three months later, Newland was sitting in a bare room at CIA headquarters waiting for his psychological evaluation. A man walked in, sat down, and asked Newland only two questions.</p><p>&#x201c;So, you grew up in Mexico?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference between an enchilada and a tostada?&#x201d;</p><p>Though puzzled by the question, Newland nevertheless explained the difference between the two dishes. After a brief chat about Mexican food, Newland politely told his interviewer that they better start the psychological evaluation because he needed to get to his next interview.</p><p>&#x201c;And he said, &#x2018;No, we&#x2019;re done,&#x2019;&#x201d; Newland remembers. Ross New-land was in the CIA.</p><p>He finished up at the London School of Economics and offi cially joined the spy agency on November 5, 1979. It was just a day after students in Iran stormed the American embassy and six weeks before Soviet paratroopers landed in Kabul as the vanguard of the hundreds of thousands of troops who would invade Afghanistan over the following months. The two events convulsed CIA headquarters, especially the fifty-three members of Ross Newland&#x2019;s class. Top agency officials ordered all trainees except those fluent in a language not spoken in the Muslim world to be funneled toward assignments in the Middle East or Central Asia.</p><p>Because he spoke Spanish, Newland was one of a dozen trainees excluded from the &#x201c;draft.&#x201d; By the time Newland had completed his case-officer training, Ronald Reagan had become president and the CIA had a newfound interest in Latin America. Cocaine was fl owing over the border into the United States, and the Reagan administration was deeply worried about the growing power of leftist guerrilla movements in Central America. Newland had a mentor in Nestor Sanchez, who by then had left Madrid and taken over the CIA&#x2019;s Latin America division. From his perch at headquarters Sanchez was able to guide Newland&#x2019;s early career, and he put him at the center of the action.</p><p>He was sent first to Bolivia, then the world&#x2019;s cocaine capital, where he was directed to cultivate sources in the drug cartels. He spent much of his time in the Bolivian lowlands, posing as an American businessman and trying to make friends among the drug-runners in the city of Santa Cruz. He drank with them, bet on cockfights, met their wives and mistresses, and drove with them out of the city to eat duck with mango and pineapple in ramshackle bungalows along the road leading into the jungle.</p><p>When he wasn&#x2019;t in Santa Cruz, he was in the Bolivian capital of La Paz, awaiting the next coup attempt. The CIA station in Bolivia took pride in predicting each coup before it happened, and the agency officers there didn&#x2019;t want to blow their perfect track record. But New-land got a bracing dose of reality about his place in the world when the one successful military overthrow during his tour in Bolivia earned only a small mention on the inside pages of <i>The New York Times</i>. The previous four attempts hadn&#x2019;t even made it into the paper.</p><p>The Reagan administration had identified the Bolivian government as a partner in the war on drugs. But as he started to penetrate the Bolivian drug networks, Newland began to write intelligence reports about the rampant corruption among top officials in La Paz, many of whom were on the payroll of the cartels. The minister of the interior was protecting the drug kingpins from prosecution, and they were paying him off in ranches, jewels, and cash. The reports were hardly what the American ambassador in La Paz wanted to read.</p><p>For Newland, the experience in Bolivia was a first glimpse of how Washington&#x2019;s policy of propping up corrupt governments to serve a singular goal&#x2014;in this case the war on drugs&#x2014;could undermine long-term American interests. He also began to question whether the CIA should really be in charge of the drug war, or whether the Reagan administration had just leaned on the agency because messy wars are best fought in secret. Two decades later he would have similar questions about the CIA&#x2019;s role in the war against terrorists.</p><br><br><p>When Newland was dispatched to Bolivia, the CIA&#x2019;s Latin America division was a relatively sleepy corner of the spy agency&#x2019;s Directorate of Operations. But it would soon become the center of the CIA&#x2019;s universe, largely because of dynamics many pay grades above Newland. In June 1981, Nestor Sanchez left the agency for the Pentagon. His replacement was Duane R. Clarridge, a gin-drinking and hard-charging spy of the old school who was exactly in the mold sought by William J. Casey, Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s newly installed CIA chief. Known to all as &#x201c;Dewey,&#x201d; Clarridge grew up in a New Hampshire family of staunch Republicans (his nickname was a tribute to Governor Thomas E. Dewey, of New York) and earned degrees from Brown and Columbia before joining the CIA in 1955. He was eager to battle the Soviet Union on each shadowy front of the Cold War. By 1981, he had served undercover in Nepal, India, Turkey, and Italy, often posing as a businessman and using pseudonyms like Dewey Marone and Dax Preston LeBaron. With a high-octane personality and a preference for white suits and pocket squares, Clarridge attracted a following among younger undercover officers. He was fond of saying that the CIA&#x2019;s clandestine service &#x201c;marches for the president,&#x201d; but his push for aggressive clandestine operations sometimes infuriated State Department diplomats. Clarridge&#x2019;s boss in Rome, Ambassador Richard Gardner, called him &#x201c;shallow and devious.&#x201d;</p><p>When he returned to Washington, in 1981, Clarridge quickly developed a rapport with Casey. On Clarridge&#x2019;s first day back at CIA headquarters, Casey called him into his office and said that the Reagan administration was worried about Cuba and the Sandinista government in Nicaragua &#x201c;exporting revolution&#x201d; throughout Central America, particularly to El Salvador. Within a week, Clarridge came back with a plan:</p><p>Take the war to Nicaragua.</p><p>Start killing Cubans.</p><br><br><p>Casey, a former OSS man, embraced the plan immediately. He told Clarridge to draft a secret finding for the president to sign, authorizing a covert war in Central America. It was very early into his presidency, but Ronald Reagan was already accelerating covert activities both in Latin America and in Afghanistan, where he increased support to the mujahedeen fighting Soviet troops. Reagan was initiating a new turn of the cycle: The &#x201c;risk-averse&#x201d; CIA was once again running secret wars abroad.</p><p>Clarridge was just the man to be in charge of the Central American front, and he used a CIA slush fund to buy guns, ammunition, mules, and heavy weapons for the Nicaraguan Contras, the rebels resisting the government. He worked closely with the Pentagon&#x2019;s specia...</p></p><h2>Women Who Love Too Much</h2><p>Is having &#39;somebody to love&#39; the most important thing in your life?

But Chandler Burr, the <i>New York Times </i>perfume critic, spent a year behind the scenes observing the creation of two major fragrances. Now, writing with wit and elegance, he juxtaposes the stories of the perfumes--one created by a Frenchman in Paris for an exclusive luxury-goods house, the other made in New York by actress Sarah Jessica Parker and Coty, Inc., a giant international corporation. We follow Coty's mating of star power to the marketing of perfume, watching <i>Sex and the City</i>'s Parker heading a hugely expensive campaign to launch a scent into the overcrowded celebrity market. Will she match the success of Jennifer Lopez? Does she have the international fan base to drive worldwide sales?<br>&nbsp;<br>In Paris at the elegant Herm�s, we see Jean Claude Ellena, his company's new head perfumer, given a challenge: he must create a scent to resuscitate Herm�s's perfume business and challenge <i>le monstre </i>of the industry, bestselling Chanel No. 5. Will his pilgrimage to a garden on the Nile supply the inspiration he needs? The answer lies in Burr's informative and mesmerizing portrait of some of the extraordinary personalities who envision, design, create, and launch the perfumes that drive their billion-dollar industry.</p><p>Chandler Burr is the <i>New York Times </i>perfume critic and author of <i>The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses </i>and <i>A Separate Creation</i>. Burr, who earned a master's in international economics and Japan studies from the Paul H.

He lives in New York City.Introduction<br>On June 9, 2004, just before 5:00 p.m., Jean-Claude Ellena was being driven to a meeting at the offices of Parfums Herm�s in Pantin, just outside the p�riph�rique to the northeast of Paris. Ellena was a famous ghost, a member of an elite group of perfumers who create fragrances sold under the names of designers and luxury houses while keeping assiduously to the shadows. But he was just at the point of becoming particularly, and rather extraordinarily, visible to the world. He was on his way to Herm�s to submit his first essais, his olfactory sketches, for an important scent he was creating.<br>Paris was enjoying a spell of Los Angeles&#x2013;like weather. You could look from the top of rue M�nilmontant down over the Centre Georges Pompidou&#x2019;s industrial modernism all the way to the Eutelsat balloon floating over the Parc Andr� Citro�n. In the deep-cobalt summer sky, the cloud of aerosolized filth from the Paris traffic hovered in the blue air. The sun shone brightly. The Parisians walked around wearing black, smoking cigarettes, exhaling ashen fumes into the air, and throwing the butts and packets onto streets where Africans in cotton bleus de travail uniforms swept them into sewers.<br>From his car, Ellena looked out at the bus stops. It seemed as if every single one featured an ad for Chanel&#x2019;s latest feminine perfume, Chance. It was a bit startling. The car crossed an avenue, stopped at a light: Chance. It turned right: Chance. Ellena looked left; from every vantage the publicity image of a wispy blond girl floated spectrally over the round metallic glass Chance bottle. This display represented a breathtaking marketing outlay. If you were in the perfume industry, if you were the competition&#x2014;say, another immaculate luxury house like Herm�s&#x2014;you might not show any reaction. You might smile, eyes focused just beyond the ads. But you would register them as they slid by your car, this show of Chanel&#x2019;s stunning power, a silken reminder of the might of this billion-dollar titanium luxury machine. The bus ads were not a campaign. They were a statement. &#x201c;We are here.&#x201d; Their ubiquitousness was profoundly intimidating. This was the intention.<br>Herm�s had, in fact, two responses. The first was the three small vials in Ellena&#x2019;s pocket, each containing a pale golden-colored scent. The second was Ellena himself.<br>.<br>Across the Atlantic not many months later, at 1:00 p.m. on October 29, 2004, the actress Sarah Jessica Parker arrived at the offices of her agent, Peter Hess, at Creative Artists Agency at 162 Fifth Avenue in New York City. She was there to meet representatives from Coty, Inc., the international perfume licensing corporation, whose headquarters were just up the street. Parker and her representatives would be discussing the final details of a contract for the creation of a perfume that would bear her name.<br>They met in one of the white CAA conference rooms. Along with Hess, Parker&#x2019;s rep Ina Treciokas from the public relations agency IDPR was present. The Coty contingent numbered four, all perfume industry executives and &#x201c;creatives&#x201d; (as those in charge of developing a perfume are called in the industry). There was excellent sushi and a big bowl of popcorn, a neat line of drinks, and bowls of ice. Parker was dressed in relaxed style&#x2014;jeans and a T-shirt&#x2014;but she was quite alert to the significance of the meeting and to the variables at play.<br>Parker had for years been a star on stage and on screen, but she was as aware as anyone of the risks of attempting to transfer the mercurial, amorphous good of celebrity to other domains. In both a symbolic and a literal sense, she was funding this project with her public equity. But she had for years wanted to create a perfume&#x2014;&#x201c;dreamed of it,&#x201d; as she expressed it eagerly to the Coty team that day. Peter Hess and CAA had been pursuing it for her, making the contacts, talking to the players in the perfume world&#x2014;the luxury juggernauts like the Lauders and LVMHs, with their brands and labs and marketing armies&#x2014;and Hess had found the process far from easy; the perfume industry is brutal, and the financial stakes increasingly high. Yet Coty was interested in Parker, and the lawyers&#x2014;Coty&#x2019;s and the star&#x2019;s&#x2014;had been working on the contract for many months. It had been a complicated negotiation.<br>Hess naturally shared Parker&#x2019;s concerns. Were she to give Coty the license to her name and her public identity, the project would entail years of effort on her part and that of the Coty team that would develop the scent with her, millions of dollars put into the launch and a massive promotional campaign, and the risk of her image and reputation.<br>It would also require of Parker a special, and rather unusual, form of participation. During the development of the scent, she would assume the position known in the industry as artistic director. She would have to guide the perfumers who would build her scent. She would be responsible for directing them toward a precise olfactory representation of an idea of a perfume she already had in her head. Parker had never played the role before&#x2014;it was the perfumers who understood mixing rose absolute with dihydrojasmonate, not she&#x2014;and she didn&#x2019;t, truth be told, know exactly what to expect.<br>.<br>Between 2004 and 2006, I reported these two stories, one for The New Yorker, the other for The New York Times. Both were intimate behind-the-scenes accounts of two very different people creating two very different perfumes. Ellena&#x2019;s scent was built at and for Herm�s, among the last family-owned exclusive luxury goods houses in France, based in an eighteenth-century shop on the rue du Faubourg. It was created in Paris and in Grasse, France&#x2019;s traditional capital of scent. Parker&#x2019;s fragrance was made under the corporate aegis of one of the largest commercial producers of perfume in the world, a company headquartered in a skyscraper in New York City.<br>The first perfume was Un Jardin sur le Nil. The other was Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely.<br>It happened that I fell into both of these stories&#x2014;they found me, each one in its own particular way. Both of these scents were built to be launched on the $31-billion international perfume market, and in the course of reporting on their respective creation processes, I spent two years inside this industry, one of the most insular, glamorous, strange, paranoid, idiosyncratic, irrational, and lucrative of worlds.<br>I am the perfume critic for The New York Times, but I am not a visceral perfume obsessive. Some people want me to be, but I&#x2019;m not. Fundamentally I&#x2019;m a reporter and critic whose job is to write on perfume&#x2014;the business, industry, and personalities, and of course the works of commercial art they produce, the perfumes. It&#x2019;s a professional beat. At the same time, writing about perfume has held a real, and I will admit visceral, surprise, which is that I am now conscious of experiencing the world more deeply and vividly than I&#x2019;d ever thought possible. Many people situate themselves by sight; they marvel at scenic vistas, take photos, draw pictures, recall images. In this job I find my brain recording time and place in scent. I remember places by smell.<br>In travel, smell is our best, most reliable landmark. Researchers have found that our ability to recall a specific scent surpasses even our ability to recall what we&#x2019;ve seen. Show photos to people, then show them the photos months later; it&#x2019;s estimated that visual recall is about 50 percent after four months. Trygg Engen, a professor of psychology at Brown University, found that people recall smells with 65 percent accuracy after a year. If you&#x2019;ve been in Africa or Asia or Latin America for any significant period of time and then return home, open your suitcase and take out the clothes, and the aroma places you. You&#x2019;re in Nairobi or the bush, Bangkok&#x2019;s center, the beach in Rio. Photos can&#x2019;t do that. Smell transports us, beautifully, strongly, insistently. The smell of my childhood was South Texas, but also the aroma of travel, of jet fuel, the synthetic carpets of airports, and the recycled air of planes. My grandmother, Marjorie Langston Stewart, lived in the Corpus Christi of the 1960s, two blocks from the Gulf of Mexico. While I remember her voice and face, she actually exists in my memory as a fragrance: of fresh citrus and the green leaves of the poisonous Texas oleander she warned my sister and me never to touch, the hot wet breezes of the Gulf of Mexico off fishing boats, the clean, rich Victorian smells of the England she grew up in that scented her house, and the scent of her immense, powerful, white 1958 Pontiac&#x2019;s interior. The years I spent following these two stories were mapped in scent in just this way, and I recall its chapters by their smells.<br>The main actors in each story were utterly different&#x2014;a French perfumer and an American movie star&#x2014;and the companies and contexts in which they worked were dissimilar in a thousand ways, but both stories began with a problem.<br>.<br>At Herm�s, the problem was simple to identify, tough to solve.<br>Herm�s is as close to an immaculate brand as it is possible to get. In the business world, the name commands absolute respect. But while consumers from Paris to Osaka faithfully snapped up astoundingly expensive Herm�s silks, clothes, and leather bags, the Herm�s family was quietly aware of a weakness in the house: its perfumes.<br>Clients on Fifth Avenue and the Ginza, avenue Montaigne and Via Monte Napoleone were reaching for bottles of Chanel, Armani, Calvin Klein, and Dior well before they reached for an Herm�s scent. For a luxury house, a perfume problem is not just an image issue. It goes inevitably to the heart of your business. Because of its profit margins and its massive distribution, perfume is a crucial money generator for almost all the high-end houses. It&#x2019;s an open secret that fragrance is essential to the financial health of most of the world&#x2019;s luxury brands. A man I know once sat next to Yves Saint Laurent at a Paris dinner party. He asked, &#x201c;What portion of Yves Saint Laurent revenues are accounted for by perfume?&#x201d; Saint Laurent replied, &#x201c;Eighty-three point five.&#x201d;<br>By 2004, Herm�s (the name&#x2019;s French pronunciation is closest to a combination of &#x201c;air-mess&#x201d; and &#x201c;air-mezz&#x201d;) was ready to confront the perfume problem. Jean-Louis Dumas-Herm�s was the head of the family, which owned 75 percent of the house. Dumas was elegant and refined and his personal worth was around $1.5 billion, and if he presented a certain gentleness that overlay a steely control, he was remarkably free of the arrogance that haute Parisian culture and great wealth could have produced in him. In 2004, Dumas hired a new president of Parfums Herm�s, V�ronique Gautier. Gautier had a significant reputation.<br>Dark-haired and dark-eyed, opinionated and direct, Gautier was a veteran of perfume operations at Chanel and Cartier. She was known for two skills: crafting grand strategies and imposing, with an iron will, the decisions needed to get them into place. Gautier had determinedly big vision, and she was relentlessly daring, both qualities Dumas needed. Gautier had, naturally enough, left in her professional wake a division of opinions. &#x201c;V�ronique is admired rather than liked,&#x201d; one of her French competitors, a woman, said with a hard look. Another gave a different assessment: &#x201c;She knows the business as well as anyone, and she&#x2019;s competent and strong. Jean-Louis will need that.&#x201d;<br>The figures in front of Gautier were relatively straightforward.<br>In 2003, the previous year, the Italian jeweler Bulgari had had perfume sales totaling $136,700,000. This represented 18 percent of Bulgari&#x2019;s total revenues of $759,300,000. Herm�s in the same year had sold $54 million in perfume&#x2014;less than half of Bulgari&#x2019;s sales&#x2014;on a total of $1.23 billion, which meant perfume was only 4.4 percent of Herm�s&#x2019;s business.<br>Dumas and Gautier were exquisitely conscious of the perfume referred to by some in the industry as le monstre&#x2014;the monster&#x2014;Chanel&#x2019;s Chanel No. 5. Here was a ninety-year-old fragrance always at the top of the international bestseller lists, an institution whose 2003 sales had been an astonishing $180 million. Herm�s had a collection that included excellent scents like Cal�che and 24 Faubourg, but their sales didn&#x2019;t even touch those of the fabled No. 5. Herm�s had a waiting list for its $10,000 Kelly bags, yes, but these Herm�s bags consistently carried more Chanel perfume. The question for Dumas and Gautier was: why?<br>Start with the open secret of the industry, which is that the perfumes purchased from Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, or Giorgio Armani are not created by these designers. Domenico Dolce and Marc Jacobs don&#x2019;t make their own perfumes. They don&#x2019;t know how. They never have. In fact almost none of the people whose names go on the boxes have ever touched a scent raw material in their lives. All the fragrances in the world are made by an army of professional ghosts called perfumers, who are hired by the designers and brands. The ghosts live in a sort of netherworld carefully hidden from view by the designers&#x2019; marketing machines. They work primarily for several international scent-maker corporations, the &#x201c;Big Boys&#x201d;&#x2014;Givaudan and Firmenich (both Swiss), IFF (American), Symrise (German), and Takasago (Japanese)&#x2014;plus the smaller players like Robertet, Drom, Fragrance Resources, Mane, and Belmay. Of them, the fashion houses do not speak publicly. In fact, most of them spend large amounts of money on public relations agencies in Milan, Paris, and New York in order explicitly to create the impression that the perfumes come from the designers.<br>Est�e Lauder created none of her perfumes. A huge international corporation called IFF did. International Flavors &amp; Fragrances is based in New York. Lauder gave the IFF perfumers concepts, she guided the scents to finalization, and she put her name on the scents they made, though not her real name, Josephine Esther Mentzer, nor the real names of the people who actually built the juices for her.<br>Youth-Dew, Est�e Lauder&#x2019;s first perfume, in 1953, was made by the IFF perfumer Josephine Catapano. Youth-Dew started as a simple bath oil, just a gift Lauder gave to her clients. Lauder was unknown then, but IFF believed in her. Betty Busse made Est�e, the legendary Francis Camail built Aliage (the following year he would create Charlie for Revlon), and the equally legendary Sophia Grojsman (Tr�sor for Lanc�me and the beautiful Jaipur for Boucheron) did Lauder&#x2019;s White Linen, a landmark in everyone&#x2019;s view. Private Collection was the creation of Vince Marcello, Beautiful was made by five different IFF perfumers. Leonard Lauder gave credit for his multibillion-dollar success to Ernest Shiftan, IFF&#x2019;s chief perfumer who encouraged and built a generation of great American scent artists. Est�e was, perfumers note, demanding and involved; she had taste and she had vision, and she closely creative-directed the scents they made. But perfumers also note (although they never do so on the record) that saying she created her own perfumes would be, as the perfume expert Michael Edwards phrased it, like saying Pope Julius painted the Sistine Chapel.<br>This arrangement is standard industry-wide practice. In 1947, Christian Dior&#x2019;s first, Miss Dior, was made by two Givaudan perfumers, Jean Carles and Paul Vacher. In 2007, the summer launch by Giorgio Armani, who is well-known for wanting the public to believe he makes his own perfumes, was built for him by the perfumers Francis Kurkdjian and Fran�oise Caron.<br>The arrangement is an uneasy one in all sorts...</p><h2>Our Sunday Visitor&#39;s Catholic Encyclopedia for Children</h2><p>Fascinating stories and whimsical illustrations delight children as they discover the basics of the Catholic Church!

Throughout the 20th century, they have been centres of the avant-garde that question the established codes of social life and experiment with different realities, merging interior and furniture design, graphics and art with sound, light, fashion and special effects to create a modern Gesamtkunstwerk. Night Fever: A Design History of Club Culture examines the history of the nightclub, with examples ranging from Italian nightclubs of the 1960s that were created by members of the Radical Design group to the legendary Studio 54 in New York, Philippe Starck&#x2019;s Les Bains Douches in Paris and the more recent Double Club in London, conceived by German artist Carsten H�ller for the Prada Foundation. Featuring films and vintage photographs, posters and fashion, Night Fever takes the reader on a fascinating journey through a world of glamour, subculture and the search for the night that never ends.</p><p></p><h2>On Slavery and Abolitionism: Essays and Letters (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A collection of historic writings from the slave-owner-turned-abolitionist sisters portrayed in Sue Monk Kidd&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i>The Invention of Wings</i></b><br><br>Sarah and Angelina Grimk�&#x2019;s portrayal in Sue Monk Kidd&#x2019;s latest novel,&nbsp;<i>The Invention of Wings</i>, has brought much-deserved new attention to these inspiring Americans. The first female agents for the American Anti-Slavery Society, the sisters originally rose to prominence after Angelina wrote a rousing letter of support to renowned abolitionist William Garrison in the wake of Philadelphia&#x2019;s pro-slavery riots in 1935.&nbsp; Born into Southern aristocracy, the Grimk�s grew up in a slave-holding family. Hetty, a young house servant, whom Sarah secretly taught to read, deeply influenced Sarah Grimk�&#x2019;s life, sparking her commitment to anti-slavery activism.&nbsp; As adults, the sisters embraced Quakerism and dedicated their lives to the abolitionist and women&#x2019;s rights movements. Their appeals and epistles were some of the most eloquent and emotional arguments against slavery made by any abolitionists. Their words, greeted with trepidation and threats in their own time, speak to us now as enduring examples of triumph and hope.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

She and her daemon, Pantalaimon, determine to find him. Their quest leads them to the bleak splendour of the North where a team of scientists are conducting unspeakably horrible experiments.</p><p>Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, <i>The Golden Compass</i>, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal <i>d�mon</i>, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied: <blockquote> As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had d�mons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. </blockquote> Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her d�mon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey d�mon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear. <p> In <i>The Golden Compass</i>, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman<br>I love this book, so when we decided to give out copies at a convention this summer, I was thrilled!

In the latter group was Lieutenant Colonel John K.<br>Waters, an Armor officer who had been captured in Tunisia. He was<br>married to the former Beatrice Patton. His father-in-law was General<br>George S. Patton. Waters later became a four-star general.<br><br>At Katyn, there were several recently reopened mass graves. As the<br>Americans watched, other mass graves were reopened. They contained<br>the bodies of thousands of Polish officers who had surrendered in 1940<br>to the Red Army when the Russians invaded Poland from the East<br>and Germany from the West.<br><br>The Germans told the Americans that the Polish officers had been<br>taken from the Kozelsk prisoner-of-war camp to the forest in 1940&#x2014;<br>shortly after the surrender&#x2014;by the Soviet NKVD. There, after their<br>hands had been wired behind them, they were executed by pistol shots<br>into the back of their heads.<br><br>The Germans permitted the American doctors to examine the<br>corpses and to remove from their brains the bullets that had killed<br>them. It was the opinion of the American doctors that the bodies had<br>in fact been so murdered and had been decomposing since 1940.<br><br>The Americans were then returned to their POW camp. The bullets<br>removed from the brains of the murdered Polish officers were distributed<br>among them.<br><br>It is now known that there was some communication, in both directions,<br>between the Allies and American prisoners of war in Germany.<br>It is credible to assume that the prisoners who had been taken to<br>Hammelburg managed to tell Eisenhower&#x2019;s headquarters in London<br>what they had seen in the Katyn Forest, and possible, if by no means<br>certain, that they managed to get the bullets to London, as well.<br><br>Very late in the war, in March 1945, General Patton gave a very<br>unusual assignment to one of his very best tank officers, Lieutenant<br>Colonel Creighton W. Abrams, who then commanded Combat Command<br>B of the 4th Armored Division. Abrams had broken through<br>the German lines to rescue the surrounded 101st Airborne Division at<br>Bastogne, and was later to become chief of staff of the U.S. Army. The<br><br>U.S. Army&#x2019;s main battle tank today is the Abrams.<br>The official story was that Patton told Abrams he feared the Germans<br>would execute the American POWs being held in Oflag XIII-B,<br>in Hammelburg, Germany, then fifty miles behind the German lines,<br>when it appeared they would be liberated by the Red Army.<br><br>Abrams was ordered to mount an immediate mission to get to<br>Hammelburg before the Russians did and to liberate the Americans.<br>In the late evening of March 26, 1945, Task Force Baum&#x2014;a company<br>of medium tanks, a platoon of light tanks, and a company of<br>armored infantry, under Captain Abraham Baum&#x2014;set out to do so.<br><br>The mission was not successful. It was mauled by the Germans.<br>When word of it got out, Patton was severely criticized for staging a<br>dangerous raid to rescue his son-in-law. He denied knowing Colonel<br>Waters was in Oflag XIII-B. When, shortly afterward, Oflag XIII-B<br>was liberated by the Red Army, Waters was not there.<br><br>It later came out that Waters and 101st Airborne Division Second<br>Lieutenant Lory L. McCullough (an interesting character, who<br>learned that he had been awarded a battlefield commission only after<br>he had been captured during Operation Marketgarden) had escaped<br>from captivity while the Germans had been marching the prisoners on<br>foot toward Hammelburg and had made their escape to North Africa<br>through the Russian port of Odessa on the Black Sea.<br><br>When this came out, there was some knowledgeable speculation<br>that Patton had known Waters was in Oflag XIII-B, and had been<br>worried, because of Waters&#x2019;s knowledge of the Katyn Forest massacre,<br>that if the Red Army reached Hammelburg before the Americans, Waters<br>would have been killed by the Red Army to keep his mouth shut.<br><br>Why else, this speculation asked, would Waters have elected his<br>incredibly dangerous escape with McCullough rather than just stay<br>where they were and wait in safety to be liberated?<br><br>The Katyn Forest Massacre was not unknown in the West. The<br>Polish government in exile had proof of it as early as 1942. When they<br>requested an investigation by the International Red Cross, Russia<br>broke diplomatic relations with the Poles. Churchill had not wanted<br>to annoy his Russian ally, and Roosevelt believed it was Nazi propaganda.<br>The Russians wouldn&#x2019;t do anything like that.<br><br>And then, at the very end of the war, Major General Reinhard<br>Gehlen, who had been chief of Abwehr Ost, the German military intelligence<br>agency dealing with the Soviet Union, added some further<br>light on the subject.<br><br>Gehlen had made a deal with Allen W. Dulles, who had been the<br>Office of Strategic Services station chief in Berne, Switzerland, to<br>turn over all of his assets&#x2014;including agents in place in the Kremlin&#x2014;<br>to the OSS in return for the OSS protection of his officers and men,<br>and their families, from the Red Army.<br><br>Among the documents turned over were some that Gehlen&#x2019;s agents<br>had stolen from the Kremlin itself. They included photographic copies<br>of NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria&#x2019;s proposal, dated March 5, 1940, to<br>execute all captured Polish officers. Gehlen also provided photographic<br>copies of Stalin&#x2019;s personal approval of the proposal, signed by him on<br>behalf of the Soviet Politburo, and reports from functionaries of the<br>NKVD reporting in detail their execution of their orders. At least<br>21,768, and as many as 22,002, Poles had been murdered. Approximately<br>8,000 were military officers, approximately 6,000 were police<br>officers, and the rest were members of the intelligentsia, landowners,<br>factory owners, lawyers, officials, and priests.<br><br>The Americans could not raise this in the face of the Soviet Union,<br>however, as they would have had to say where they got their information,<br>and when the Nuremberg trials began, the Americans were denying<br>any knowledge of the whereabouts of former Major General<br>Reinhard Gehlen.<br>[ ONE ]<br><br>Walter Reed Army Medical Center<br><br>Washington, D.C.<br><br>0905 22 December 1945<br><br>The MP at the gate did not attempt to stop the Packard Clipper<br>when it approached the gate.

They are among Europe&#39;s best loved and enduring children&#39;s classics, and through the current TV animation (BBC2), the warm-hearted, whimsical creatures of Moomin valley have been brought to a new younger British audience. This book introduces the first Sort Of Children&#39;s Classic in a new English version by Sophie Hannah. Sort of Books proudly presents the original full colour Moomin picture book with its irresistible cut-out page designs and playful rhyming text in a new version by one of Britain&#39;s star poets.</p><p>The writer and artist Tove Jansson (1914-2001) is a Scandinavian national treasure: she has a museum dedicated to her work in her native Finland, and the Moomin characters adorn everything from mugs to schoolbags. Elsewhere, Moomin stories have been published in 35 languages. Sophie Hannah is that rare thing: an acclaimed and best-selling poet. Her first book was greeted with amazement. The Poetry Review declared, &#39;Shall I put it in capitals? SOPHIE HANNAH IS A GENIUS.&#39; Each subsequent collection has been informally more inventive, thematically more complex, yet each has met with a similar welcome.Moomintroll from the milk-shop ran with milk for Mother in his can, up through the forest dark and wide, wind in the tall trees moaned and sighed.

He draws out the ambiguities in our concepts of the religious and the secular through a rich consideration of translatability and untranslatability, exploring the circuitous movements of ideas between histories and cultures.<br><br>In search of meeting points between the language of Islam and the language of secular reason, Asad gives particular importance to the translations of religious ideas into nonreligious ones. He discusses the claim that liberal conceptions of equality represent earlier Christian ideas translated into secularism; explores the ways that the language and practice of religious ritual play an important but radically transformed role as they are translated into modern life; and considers the history of the idea of the self and its centrality to the project of the secular state. Secularism is not only an abstract principle that modern liberal democratic states espouse, he argues, but also a range of sensibilities. The shifting vocabularies associated with each of these sensibilities are fundamentally intertwined with different ways of life. In exploring these entanglements, Asad shows how translation opens the door for&#x2015;or requires&#x2015;the utter transformation of the translated. Drawing on a diverse set of thinkers ranging from al-Ghaz&#x101;l&#x12b; to Walter Benjamin, <i>Secular Translations</i> points toward new possibilities for intercultural communication, seeking a language for our time beyond the language of the state.</p><p>Talal Asad is Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image � but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

In February 1945, while he was captain of a reconnaissance battery of the Soviet Army, he was arrested and sentenced to an eight-year term in a labor camp and permanent internal exile, which was cut short by Khrushchev's reforms, allowing him to return from Kazakhstan to Central Russia in 1956. Although permitted to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> in 1962--which remained his only full-length work to have appeared in his homeland until 1990--Solzhenitsyn was by 1969 expelled from the Writers' Union. The publication in the West of his other novels and, in particular, of <i>The Gulag Archipelago,</i> brought retaliation from the authorities. In 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and forcibly flown to Frankfurt. Solzhenitsyn and his wife and children moved to the United States in 1976. In September 1991, the Soviet government dismissed treason charges against him; Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994.

As Mrs Darracott had merely been recounting to her daughter the tale of her activities that day the snub might have been thought unjust, but she accepted it, if not with equanimity, with a resignation born of custom, merely exchanging a droll look with her daughter, and directing one of warning at her handsome young son. The butler glanced menacingly at the younger of the two footmen, but the precaution was unnecessary: Charles had not been employed at Darracott Place above six months, but he was not such a whopstraw as to make the least noise in the performance of his duties when his lordship was out of humour. That was the way Chollacombe described as knaggy an old gager as ever Charles had had the ill-fortune to serve. Stiff-rumped, that's what he was, always nabbing the rust, or riding grub, like he had been for months past.</p> <p>Charles had thought himself lucky to have been taken on at Darracott Place, but he wasn't going to stay above his twelvemonth, not if he knew it! It might suit James, being Kentish born, to work in a great, rambling house stuck down miles from anywhere, in a marsh flat and bare enough to give anyone a fit of the blue devils, and with never a soul, outside the Family, coming next or nigh it, but when Charles went after another place he was going to London. Let alone he was always one for a bit of life, you could earn extra gelt in London, for there were always errands to be run, or notes to be delivered, and you got a shilling every time you were sent off to execute such commissions. If messages had to be carried in the country it stood to reason they were taken by one of the grooms; while as for the throng of open-fisted guests his Dad had told him it would be his duty to wait upon well, a houseful of guests might have been what his Dad was used to in his day but it wasn't what they was used to at Darracott Place!</p> <p>Such visions as Charles had indulged when he had first blessed his good fortune at being hired to fill the post of second footman in a nobleman's establishment! A proper take-in that had been, and so he would tell his Dad! Dad, honourably retired from employment as butler to a Gentleman of Fashion, had assured him that to be hired to serve in a lord's country seat did not mean that he would be immured in rural fastness throughout the year. My lord (said Dad) would certainly retire to Kent during the winter months; but at the beginning of the Season he would remove to his London house; and at the end of the Season (said Dad) the chances were that he would hire a house in Brighton for the summer months. And from time to time, of course, he would be absent, visiting friends in other parts of the country, during which periods his servants would enjoy a great deal of leisure, and might even be granted leave to go on holiday.</p> <p>But nothing like that had happened at Darracott Place since Charles had first entered its portals. My lord, whose grim mouth and arctic stare could set stronger knees than Charles's knocking together, remained in residence all the year round, neither entertaining nor being entertained. And no use for anyone to tell Charles that this was because the Family was in mourning for Mr Granville Darracott and his son, Mr Oliver, both drowned off the coast of Cornwall in an ill-fated boating expedition: Charles might only have been second footman at Darracott Place for a couple of months when that disaster occurred, but no one could gammon him into thinking that my lord cared a spangle for his heir. If you were to ask him, Charles would say that my lord cared for no one but Mr Richmond: he certainly couldn't abide Mr Matthew Darracott, who was the last of his sons left alive; while as for Mr Claud, who was the younger of Mr Matthew's two sons, it was as much as anyone could do not to burst out laughing to see my lord look at him as if he was a cockroach, or a bed-bug. Nor, though he didn't look at him like that, could you think he cared a groat for Mr Vincent neither; while as for poor Mrs Darracott, as kind a lady as you'd find anywhere, even if she was a bit of a prattle-box, it seemed like she had only to open her mouth for my lord to give her one of his nasty set-downs. He didn't, it was true, do that to Miss Anthea, but that was probably because Miss Anthea wasn't scared of him, like her Ma, and would maybe give as good as she got; it wasn't because he was fond of her, as you'd think her granddad would be. It wouldn't be Miss Anthea as would coax him out of his sullens; it would be Mr Richmond.</p> <p>But Richmond, his grandfather's darling, after one thoughtful glance cast under his lashes at that uncompromising countenance appeared to lose himself in his own reflections. Some pickled crab, which he had not touched, had been removed with a damson pie; and his sister saw, peeping round the massive silver epergne that almost obscured him from her view, that he had eaten no more than a spoonful of this either. Since he had partaken quite liberally of two of the dishes that had made up the first course she was undismayed by anything other than her grandfather's failure to notice his present abstention. In general Lord Darracott would have bullied Richmond into eating the pie, imperfectly concealing his anxious affection for the youth, whose earlier years had been attended by every sort of ailment, under a hectoring manner, to which Richmond, docile yet unafraid, would submit.</p> <p>As little as Charles the footman did Anthea, or Mrs Darracott, or even Richmond understand the cause of his lordship's brooding ill-humour; rather less than Charles did any one of these three believe that it sprang from grief at the death of his eldest son. His lordship had both disliked and despised Granville; yet when the news of that fatal accident had reached Darracott Place he had been for many minutes like a man struck to stone; and when he had recovered from the first shock he had horrified his son Matthew, and Lissett, his man of business, by saying several times over, and in a voice of icy rage: &#x2018;Damn him! Damn him! Damn him!' They had almost feared for his reason, and had stood staring at him with dropped jaws until he had violently ordered them out of his sight. Matthew had never dared to enquire what extraordinary circumstances had provoked this outburst, and his lordship neither offered an explanation nor again referred to the matter. Only a black cloud seemed to descend on him, rendering him more unapproachable than ever, and so brittle-tempered that Mrs Darracott quite dreaded having to address him, and even Richmond several times had his head bitten off.</p> <p>Dinner was always a protracted meal; tonight it seemed interminable; but at last it came to an end. As the servants began to remove the covers, Mrs Darracott picked up her reticule, and rose.</p> <p>His lordship's hard, frowning eyes lifted; he said curtly: &#x2018;Wait!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Wait, sir?' faltered Mrs Darracott.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, wait!' he repeated impatiently. &#x2018;Sit down! I have something to say to you!'</p> <p>She sank back on to her chair, looking at once bewildered and apprehensive. Anthea, who had risen with her, remained standing, her head turned towards her grandfather, her brows a little raised. He paid no heed to her; his eyes were on the two footmen, and it was not until they had left the room that he spoke again. So forbidding was his expression that Mrs Darracott, in growing trepidation, began to search wildly in her mind for some forgotten error of omission or commission. Chollacombe softly shut the door on the heels of his subordinates, and picked up the port decanter from the sideboard; he perceived that his master's hands were clenching and unclenching on the arms of his chair, and his heart sank: there had been a storm brewing all day, and it was going to burst now over their heads.</p> <p>But when my lord again spoke it was as though it cost him an effort. He said: &#x2018;You will be good enough, Elvira, to inform Flitwick that I expect my son and his family here tomorrow. Make what arrangements you choose!'</p> <p>She was so much surprised that she was betrayed into uttering an unwise exclamation. &#x2018;Good gracious! Is that all? But what in the world I mean, I hadn't the least notion '</p> <p>&#x2018;What brings them here, sir?' asked Anthea, intervening to draw her grandfather's fire.</p> <p>He looked for a moment as though he were about to utter one of his rough snubs, but after a slight pause he answered her. &#x2018;They are coming because I've sent for them, miss!' He paused again, and then said: &#x2018;You may as well know now as later! I've sent for my heir as well.'</p> <p>At these bitterly uttered words Chollacombe nearly dropped the decanter.</p> <p>&#x2018;Sent for your heir as well?' repeated Richmond. &#x2018;But my uncle Matthew is your heir, Grandfather isn't he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Then who is, sir?' demanded Anthea.</p> <p>&#x2018;A weaver's brat!' he replied, his voice vibrant with loathing.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, dear!' said Mrs Darracott, breaking the stunned silence that succeeded his lordship's announcement.</p> <p>The hopeless inadequacy of this exclamation dragged a choke of laughter out of Anthea, but it caused his lordship's smouldering fury to flare up. &#x2018;Is that all you have to say? Is that all, woman? You are a wet-goose a widgeon a take yourself off, and your daughter with you! Go and chatter, and marvel, and bless yourselves, but keep out of my sight and hearing! By God, I don't know how I bear with you!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, indeed!' said Anthea instantly. &#x2018;It is a great deal too bad, sir! Mama, how could you speak so to one so full of compliance and good nature as my grandfather? So truly the gentleman! Come away at once!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's what you think of me, is it, girl?' said his lordship, a glint in his eyes.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, no!' she responded, dropping him a curtsy. &#x2018;It's what I say, sir! You must known that my featherheaded Mama has taught me to behave with all the propriety in the world! To tell you what I think of you would be to sink myself quite below reproach! Come, Mama!'</p> <p>He gave a bark of laughter. &#x2018;Tongue-valiant, eh?'</p> <p>She had reached the door, which Chollacombe was holding open, but she looked back at that. &#x2018;Try me!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I will!' he promised.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, Anthea, pray !' whispered Mrs Darracott, almost dragging her from the room. She added, as Chollacombe closed the door behind them: &#x2018;My love, you should not! You know you should not! What, I ask you, would become of us if he were to cast us off?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, he won't do that!' replied Anthea confidently. &#x2018;Even he must feel that once in a lifetime is enough for the performance of that idiocy! I collect that the weaver's son is the offspring of the uncle we are never permitted to mention? Who is he, and what is he, and oh, come and tell me all about it, Mama! You know we have leave to marvel and chatter as much as we choose!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but I don't know anything,' objected Mrs Darracott, allowing herself to be drawn into one of the saloons that opened on to the central hall of the house. &#x2018;Indeed, I never knew of his existence until your grandfather threw him at my head in that scrambling way! And I consider,' she added indignantly, &#x2018;that I behaved with perfect propriety, for I took it with composure, and I'm sure it was enough to have cast me into strong hysterics! He would have been well-served if I had fallen senseless at his feet. I was never more shocked!'</p> <p>A smile danced in her daughter's eyes, but she said with becoming gravity: &#x2018;Exactly so! But a well-bred ease of manner, you know, is quite wasted on my grandfather. Mama, when you ruffle up your feathers you look like a very pretty partridge!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But I am not wearing feathers!' objected the widow. &#x2018;Feathers for a mere family evening, and in the country, too! It would be quite ineligible, my love! Besides, you should not say such things!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, very true! It was the stupidest comparison, for whoever saw a partridge in purple plumage? You look like a turtle-dove, Mama!'</p> <p>Mrs Darracott allowed this to pass. Her mind, never tenacious, was diverted to the delicate sheen of her gown. She had fashioned it herself, from a roll of silk unearthed from the bottom of a trunk stored in one of the attics, and she was pardonably pleased with the result of her skill. The design had been copied from a plate in the previous month's issue of The Mirror of Fashion, but she had improved upon it, substituting some very fine Brussels lace (relic of her trousseau) for the chenille trimming of the illustration. Her father-in-law might apostrophize her as a wet-goose, but even he could scarcely have denied (had he had the least understanding of such matters) that she was a notable needlewoman. She was also a very pretty woman, with a plump, trim figure, large blue eyes, and a quantity of fair hair which was partially concealed under a succession of becoming caps. From the moment when she had detected a suspicion of sagging under her jaw she had made her caps to tie beneath her chin, or (more daringly) her ear; and the result was admirable. She was neither learned nor intelligent, but she contrived to dress both herself and her daughter out of a meagre jointure, supplying with her clever fingers what her purse could not buy; and she had never, during the twelve years of her widowhood, allowed either her father-in-law's snubs or the frequent discomforts of her situation to impair the amiability of her disposition. Her temper being cheerful, and the trend of her mind optimistic, she seldom fretted over the major trials which were beyond her power to mend. Her daughter, of whom she was extremely fond, was twenty-two years of age and still unwed; her spirited young son, whom she adored, was kept kicking his heels in idleness to serve his grandfather's caprice; but although she recognized that such a state of affairs was deplorable she could not help feeling that something would happen to make all right, and was able, without much difficulty, to put such dismal thoughts aside, and to expend her anxiety on lesser and more remediable problems.</p> <p>Anthea's quizzing remark brought one of these to her mind. Smoothing a crease from the purple-bloom satin, she said very seriously: &#x2018;You know, dearest, it will be excessively awkward!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What will be awkward? The weaver's son?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, him ! No, poor boy though of course it will be! I was thinking of your Aunt Aurelia. I am persuaded she will expect to see us in mourning. You know what a high stickler she is for every observance! She will think it very odd of us to be wearing colours even improper!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not at all!' replied Anthea coolly. &#x2018;By the time my grandfather has demanded to be told what cause she has to wear mourning for my uncle and my cousin, and has made her the recipient of his views on females rigging themselves out to look like so many crows, she will readily understand why you and I have abstained from that particular observance.'</p> <p>Mrs Darracott considered this rather dubiously. &#x2018;Well, yes, but there is no depending on your grandfather. I think we should at least wear black ribbons.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Very well, Mama, we will wear whatever you choose at least, I will do so if you will stop teasing yourself about such fripperies and tell me about the weaver's son, and the uncle who must not be mentioned.'</p> <p>&#x2018;But I don't know anything!' protested Mrs Darracott. &#x2018;Only that he was the next brother to poor Granville, and quite your grandfather's favourite son. Your papa was used to say that that was what enraged Grandpapa so particularly, though for my part I can't believe that he held him in the slightest affection! Never, never could I bring myself to disown my son!

When Kinsey is on her daily run, Judy is short of breath. When Kinsey is being strangled by a 300-pound sociopath, Judy can barely force air through her throat. Kaye, who has narrated all of Grafton�s Alphabet series, has the task nicely down pat. In addition to Kinsey, she creates many believable female characters, and her men are distinct (if a bit light-voiced). In this, the twentieth novel in the series, Kinsey is living in 1988. Yet the topics are thoroughly up-to-date: identity theft and abuse of the elderly. Fans of the series will be comforted to find that not much has changed in Santa Teresa. R.E.K. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil</h2><p><p> One of the century's greatest philosophers, without whom there would be no Sartre, no Foucault, no Frankfurt School, Martin Heidegger was also a man of great failures and flaws, a Faustus who made a pact with the devil of his time, Adolf Hitler. The story of Heidegger's life and philosophy, a quintessentially German story in which good and evil, brilliance and blindness are inextricably entwined and the passions and disasters of a whole century come into play, is told in this brilliant biography. </p><p> Heidegger grew up in Catholic Germany where, for a chance at pursuing a life of learning, he pledged himself to the priesthood. Soon he turned apostate and sought a university position, which set him on the path to becoming the star of German philosophy in the 1920s. R�diger Safranski chronicles Heidegger's rise along with the thought he honed on the way, with its debt to Heraclitus, Plato, and Kant, and its tragic susceptibility to the conservatism that emerged out of the nightmare of Germany's loss in World War I. A chronicle of ideas and of personal commitments and betrayals, Safranski's biography combines clear accounts of the philosophy that won Heidegger eternal renown with the fascinating details of the loves and lapses that tripped up this powerful intellectual. </p><p> The best intellectual biography of Heidegger ever written and a best-seller in Germany, <i>Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil</i> does not shy away from full coverage of Heidegger's shameful transformation into a propagandist for the National Socialist regime; nor does it allow this aspect of his career to obscure his accomplishments. Written by a master of Heidegger's philosophy, the book is one of the best introductions to the thought and to the life and times of the greatest German philosopher of the century. </p></p><p>Rdiger Safranski&#39;s evenhanded study, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil, is equally successful at illustrating its subject&#39;s pettiness and at displaying the vast power of his imagination. It is the first comprehensive biography of the man, and supersedes both Victor Faras&#39;s Heidegger and Nazism and Hugo Ott&#39;s Martin Heidegger: A Political Life. It reports many facts that these books did not, and it offers a detailed account of Heidegger&#39;s intellectual development-relating his twists and turns, with great skill and remarkable concision.-Richard Rorty, New York Times Book Review<b>R�diger Safranski</b> studies German, philosophy, and history in Frankfurt and Berlin.

No, not only, but to some extent. Here and there, my story is about something else.&#x201d;<br></i><br> A<b> </b>mesmerizing memoir of extraordinary brilliance by an entomologist, <i>The Fly Trap </i>chronicles Fredrik Sj�berg&#x2019;s life collecting hoverflies on a remote island in Sweden. Warm and humorous, self-deprecating and contemplative, and a major best seller in its native country, <i>The Fly Trap </i>is a meditation on the unexpected beauty of small things and an exploration of the history of entomology itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> What drives the obsessive curiosity of collectors to catalog their finds? What is the importance of the hoverfly? As confounded by his unusual vocation as anyone, Sj�berg reflects on a range of ideas&#x2014;the passage of time, art, lost loves&#x2014;drawing on sources as disparate as D. H. Lawrence and the fascinating and nearly forgotten naturalist Ren� Edmond Malaise. From the wilderness of Kamchatka to the loneliness of the Swedish isle he calls home, Sj�berg revels in the wonder of the natural world and leaves behind a trail of memorable images and stories.</p><p><b><b>Fredrik Sj�berg</b> </b>is an entomologist and lives with his family on the island of Runmar�, in the archipelago east of Stockholm. He is also a literary critic, translator, cultural columnist and the author of several books.<b>Chapter 3</b><br> <b><i>A Trap in Rangoon<br></i></b><br> Many years ago, before the island and the theatre, I took a passenger barge up the mighty Congo River. What an adventure! What stories I would tell! About freedom! But it didn&#x2019;t happen. I never managed to say much more than that the forests were vast and the river as broad as Kalmar Sound. And that I&#x2019;d been there. So it goes when you travel for the sake of something to say. Your eyes go weak. All I could have written were endless disquisitions about homesickness. So I kept my mouth shut.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a different story with Lad�ng Creek, I thought aloud to myself one morning among the bird-cherry blossoms. Then something remarkable happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was in the process of rigging up my big California fly trap between a couple of over-blooming sallow bushes down by the creek&#x2014;a complicated manoeuvre&#x2014;when suddenly a complete stranger appeared as if from nowhere. He just stepped straight out of the lush June greenery and addressed me politely and apologetically in English. A wood warbler sang its silver song somewhere in the trembling crown of a nervous aspen, and a pike splashed in the shallow water of the creek. The mosquitoes were stubborn in the shade. He said it was me he was looking for.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for you&#x201d; were his exact words.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried to accept this as the most natural thing in the world, as if strangers could be expected to seek me out wherever I might be. But I failed completely. Instead I stood there like an idiot among the sedge tussocks, amazed and speechless.<br> &nbsp;<br> This man was in fact, and still is, the only person I&#x2019;ve ever encountered by Lad�ng Creek. If you want to be left in peace, it&#x2019;s a good place to go. Islanders never go there, and the summer people don&#x2019;t know the place exists. The paths that once led there have now vanished. The name of the creek is not even on the map. For that matter, it&#x2019;s not much of a waterway, more of a ditch&#x2014;overgrown, silted up and periodically dry. The meadow barns that are said to have stood there are long gone, as indeed are the meadows. Slowly but surely they&#x2019;ve been invaded by fir, aspen, birch and alder. All the same, it&#x2019;s a very pretty place, as rich and spacious as a cathedral when the marsh marigolds bloom in the spring. Deer meet down by the creek, sometimes moose, but never people. Except that day.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Middle Ages, Lad�ng Creek was the channel boats used to sail to a village at the far end of the bay, which rising land elevations eventually turned into a freshwater lake. The village is still there. It&#x2019;s where we live. How old it is no one knows, but there were probably people living here as early as Viking times. The inner parts of the long bay, where the humus-brown water is very deep, must have made an ideal harbour&#x2014;a sanctuary that seafarers with base intentions surely hesitated to venture into. The granite cliff drops straight into the water. The village was easily defended against attackers from the open ocean to the east.<br> &nbsp;<br> What ships anchored here outside my window? Who rowed up the creek where today a pike can hardly make its way?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for you.&#x201d;</p><h2>Structuralism and Poststructuralism for Beginners (Writers and Readers Documentary Comic Book,)</h2><p>From the author of Looking at Philosophy and Does the Center Hold? comes an illustrated tour through the landscape of structuralism and poststructuralism which helps the reader make sense of the modern and postmodern obsessions with language and with the &#34;disappearance of the individual&#34;--ideas which unite the work of several prominent 20th-century thinkers.</p><p><b>Donald Palmer</b> is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the College of Marin in Kentfield, California.

She lives in San Francisco with her husband and son and visits Paris frequently.Aim�e Leduc felt his presence before she saw him. As if ghosts floated in his wake in the once elegant hall. She paused, pulling her black leather jacket closer against the Parisian winter morning slicing through her building, and reached for her keys. The man emerged from the shadows by her frosted paned office door. A baby&#x2019;s cry wafted up from the floor below, then the concierge&#x2019;s door slammed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mademoiselle, I need your help,&#x201d; he said. Leathery, freckled skin stretched over his skull and his ears pointed out at right angles. He wore a crumpled navy blue suit and leaned crookedly on a malacca cane.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No missing persons, Monsieur,&#x201d; she said. As winter settled, the days gray and the memories vivid, old survivors revived hopes of lost ones. She slid her tongue across her teeth to check for anything stuck, smoothed her short brown hair and smiled. She stuffed the chocolate croissant back in the bag. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t find lost relatives. My field is corporate security.&#x201d; Thirty-four years old, Aim�e, at five feet eight inches, loomed above him. &#x201c;<i>Je suis d�sol�e, </i>Monsieur, but computer forensics are my speciality.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I want.&#x201d; He straightened his posture slowly, his large eyes fearful. &#x201c;My name is Soli Hecht. I must talk with you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind his fear she saw sadness tinged by keen perception. She tried to be polite. Walk-in clients were rare. Most came through corporate connections or by word of mouth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t want your business, but we&#x2019;re carrying a full caseload. I can refer you to someone very good.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I knew your father, an honorable man. He told me to come to you if I needed help.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startled, she dropped her keys and looked away. &#x201c;But my father was killed five years ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;As always, he is in my prayers.&#x201d; Hecht bowed his head. When he looked up, his eyes bored into hers. &#x201c;Your father and I met when he was in Le Commissariat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew she had to hear him out. Still she hesitated. The cold seeped from the floorboards but it wasn&#x2019;t the only thing making her shiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Please come inside.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She unlocked the door that read <i>Leduc Detective</i> that led to the office she&#x2019;d taken over after her father&#x2019;s death, flipped on the lights, and draped her jacket over her armchair. Nineteenth-century sepia prints of Egyptian excavations hung on the walls above digitally enhanced Parisian sewer maps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hecht moved his cadaverous frame across the parquet floor. Something about him struck her as familiar. As he lifted his arm onto her desk, she saw faint blue numbers tattooed on his forearm peeking out from his jacket sleeve. Did he want her to find Nazi loot in numbered Swiss bank accounts? She scooped ground coffee into the filter, poured water, and switched on the espresso machine, which grumbled to life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Specifically, Monsieur Hecht, what is the job?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Computer penetration is your field.&#x201d; His eyes scanned the equipment lining the walls. He thrust a folder at her. &#x201c;Decipher this computer code. The Temple Emanuel is hiring you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Regarding?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We need proof that a woman&#x2019;s relatives avoided deportation to Buchenwald. But I don&#x2019;t want to raise her hopes.&#x201d; He looked away, as if there was more he could say, but didn&#x2019;t. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve stopped doing that kind of work, Monsieur Hecht. That was more my father&#x2019;s field. To be honest, if I kept his promise you&#x2019;d get less than the best.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I knew your father, I trusted him.&#x201d; Hecht gripped the edge of her desk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How did you know him?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A man of honor, he told me I could rely on you.&#x201d; Soli Hecht hung his head. &#x201c;We had many dealings before the explosion. I need your expertise.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drummed her chipped red nails on her desk and pushed the painful memories aside. Steaming muddy liquid dripped into the waiting demitasse cup. &#x201c;Monsieur, <i>un petit caf�</i>?&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Non, merci.&#x201d;</i> He shook his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e unwrapped a sugar cube and plopped it in her cup. &#x201c;I do computer security,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Not missing persons.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He said you would help me . . . that I could always come to you.&#x201d; Short of going back on her father&#x2019;s word, one path remained.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x201c;D&#x2019;accord,&#x201d;</i> she relented with inner misgivings. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you my standard contract form.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My word must be enough.&#x201d; He extended his hand. &#x201c;As far as you are concerned, you don&#x2019;t know me. Agreed?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook his gnarled hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This will take several days? I was told it could be slow work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe a few hours. I type one hundred and twenty conventional words a minute.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled and sat down, shoved last night&#x2019;s faxes to the side of her desk, and leaned towards him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were in school in America when I knew your father.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of hope, she&#x2019;d searched for her American roots and the mother who&#x2019;d disappeared when she was eight. She hadn&#x2019;t found either. &#x201c;Briefly. I was an exchange student in New York.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Your father articulated his casework philosophy to me and I&#x2019;ve always remembered it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Things weren&#x2019;t usually what they seemed or he&#x2019;d be out of business?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hecht nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re independent, no ties or affiliations to anyone.&#x201d; His crooked fist drummed the table. &#x201c;I like that about you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew a lot about her. She also had the distinct impression he was leaving something out. &#x201c;Our fees are seven hundred and fifty francs a day.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hecht nodded dismissively. Now she remembered. She&#x2019;d seen his photo years ago when his evidence helped bring Klaus Barbie to trial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Look inside the folder,&#x201d; Hecht said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e opened his file, noticing the digits and slash marks, a distinctive trademark of Israeli military encryption. Her expertise was in hacking into systems, huge corporate ones. But this code spoke of the Cold War&#x2014;a slippery tunneling job. She hesitated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two thousand francs are in the folder. Deliver your results to 64 rue des Rosiers to Lili Stein. She&#x2019;s home after her shop closes. I&#x2019;ve told her to expect a visitor.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e felt she had to be honest; breaking an encrypted code had never taken her that long. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve given me too much.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head. &#x201c;Take it. She has a hard time getting around. Remember, give this only to Lili Stein.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shrugged. &#x201c;No problem.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You must put this in Lili Stein&#x2019;s hands.&#x201d; Hecht&#x2019;s tone had changed, from fervent to pleading. &#x201c;Swear to me on your father&#x2019;s grave. On his honor.&#x201d; His eyes locked on to hers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of Holocaust secret was this? Slowly she nodded in agreement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We will have no more contact, Mademoiselle.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soli Hecht&#x2019;s joints cracked as he rose. His face wrinkled in pain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You could have faxed me this query, Monsieur Hecht. It would have saved you this trip.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve neither talked nor met, Mademoiselle Leduc,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e bit back her reply and opened the door for him. Warped floorboards, a tarnished mirror, and scuffed plaster adorned the unheated landing. She buzzed for the turn-of-the-century wire elevator grating noisily up the shaft. Slowly and painfully he made his way to the hall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in her office, she stuffed the francs into her pocket. The overdue France T�l�com bill and horse meat for Miles Davis&#x2014;pronounced Meels Daveez, her bichon frise&#x2014;would wait until she&#x2019;d done the promised work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eurocom, the cable giant, had royally screwed up her finances by breaking Leduc&#x2019;s security service contract and hiring a rival Seattle firm, the only other firm that did the same work as she and her partner. She hoped there&#x2019;d be enough money left to spring her suits from the dry cleaner&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her standard software keys enabled her to crack coded encryptions. They opened information stored in a database, in this case, she figured, a military one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After punching in her standard key, &#x201c;Access denied&#x201d; flashed on the screen. She tried another software key, R�seau Militaire, an obscure military network. Still the screen flashed &#x201c;Access denied.&#x201d; Intrigued, she tried various other keys but got nowhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning turned into afternoon, shadows lengthened, and dusk settled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several hours she realized she would earn her francs on this one. So far, nothing worked.</p><h2>The Blood of Gods: A Novel of Rome (Emperor)</h2><p>One of history&#x2019;s most notorious assassinations sets the stage for a riveting tale of political intrigue, epic battle, and righteous retribution in a new novel of ancient Rome from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Conn Iggulden. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>THE BLOOD OF GODS</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Julius Caesar has been cut down. His blood stains the hands of a cabal of bold conspirators, led by famed general Marcus Brutus&#x2014;whom Caesar once called a friend. Have these self-proclaimed liberators bravely slain a power-mad tyrant or brutally murdered the beloved Father of Rome? Hailed as heroes by a complicit Senate and granted amnesty, the killers eagerly turn toward plotting the empire&#x2019;s future under their control. But Caesar&#x2019;s death does not rest easily with all of Rome. For two men whose bonds of friendship, family, and fidelity to the emperor are unbreakable, the shocking assassination is nothing less than treason. And those responsible must pay with their lives. <br> &nbsp;<br> Through countless battles and years of peace, Marc Antony has wielded a sword and raised a cup at Caesar&#x2019;s side. Now, in the wake of the cold-blooded coup, he is powerless against the political might of Brutus and his treacherous senators. Yet with no weapons other than eloquence and outrage, Antony will turn the tide of public opinion and spark a rebellion that will set the streets of Rome ablaze. At the same time, Gaius Octavian, adopted son and chosen heir of Caesar, has gained wealth and influence beyond imagining. But the soul-deep wound of his father&#x2019;s death will never be healed by gold or power. He will rest only with the blood of the killers on his blade.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Drawn together by their common cause, Antony and Octavian marshal their forces into an avenging army on a mission to reunite all that Caesar&#x2019;s fall has torn asunder. Even as his cohorts flee for their lives&#x2014;or fall prey to vigilantes&#x2014;a defiant Brutus vows never to relinquish what his ruthless ambition has won him. As opposing legions join in mortal combat, the destiny of Rome will turn on which of their commanders is the mightiest and most cunning.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marking the author&#x2019;s triumphant return to the setting of his celebrated Emperor<i> </i>series, <i>The Blood of Gods </i>unfolds with unmatched power, electric with the high-adventure storytelling, captivating historical detail, and stirring battle scenes for which Conn Iggulden is renowned.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Blood of Gods</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;The seasoned Iggulden adeptly brings all the intrigue and action of the era vividly to life, maintaining a historically authentic backdrop as he fictionalizes Octavian&#x2019;s evolution from callow youth to Augustus, the bold and fearless architect of a new chapter in Roman history.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Booklist</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Iggulden does fine work in his deft character studies of the principals and their various motives for alternately stirring up civil war or defending a new empire in the borning. . . .

He is also the co-author of the #1<i> New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys</i>, <i>The Dangerous Book of Heroes, </i>and<i> Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children</i>. He lives with his wife and children in Hertfordshire, England, where he is working on his next book.Part One<br>Chapter 1<br><br>Octavian winced as he felt the heat of the rocks burning through his thin sandals. Though Rome claimed to have finally brought civilization to Greece, he could see little sign of it in the hill villages. Away from the coast, the people were either suspicious of strangers or openly hostile. Even a simple request to use a well was met with frowns and doors shut in their faces. All the while, the sun beat down, reddening their necks. Octavian remembered how he had smiled when the local praetor said there were places in Greece where a young Roman had about as much chance of survival as a tax-�gatherer. It had been an exaggeration, but not by much.<br><br>He stopped to wipe sweat from his face. The land itself was wild, with canyons that seemed to drop forever. Octavian took a deep breath, suddenly certain he&#x2019;d be walking out. Nothing would give the local boys more pleasure than seeing three footsore Romans searching for stolen mounts.<br><br>Octavian stayed alert as he climbed, looking for some sign of the group of ragged men they followed. The trail had been easy at first, until it split and split again. Octavian didn&#x2019;t know if the bandits knew they would be pursued or had just taken different routes home, vanishing into the cauldron of mountains as their ancestors had done for thousands of years. He felt an itch and craned his neck to see as far as he could. It was too easy to imagine a bowman leaning over the lip of some crag and attacking before they even knew he was there.<br><br>&#x201c;Call out if you see anything,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Maecenas snorted, waving a hand at bare rocks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a tracker,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;For all I know, they could have passed through here with a herd of goats just an hour ago. Why don&#x2019;t we go back to the main group and take up the search from there? This is not how I expected to spend my leave. I imagined more wine and less . . . climbing.&#x201d; He grunted as they reached a great step in the rocks.<br><br>There was no sign of a path and each man heaved himself up, their sandals skidding and scrambling as they went. The sun was fierce above and the sky was an aching blue. All three were sweating heavily and the single flask of water was already empty.<br><br>&#x201c;At least the men from the town know these hills,&#x201d; Maecenas went on. &#x201c;They know where to search.&#x201d;<br><br>Octavian didn&#x2019;t have the breath to respond. The slope grew steeper and steeper until he had to use his hands to steady each step, then really climb. He was panting lightly as he reached the top of a crag and stared, judging the best route down the other side. The maze of gray rocks stretched into the distance, empty of life beyond the lizards that skittered away with every step.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have me stand by and watch, doing nothing to help them?&#x201d; Octavian said suddenly. &#x201c;A rape and a murder, Maecenas. You saw her body. What honor would there be in letting a few farmers chase them down while we stand and watch, confirming everything they say about idle Romans? Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>He jerked his head at a route that would take them to the floor of the canyon and began climbing down. At least the shadowed clefts were cooler, until they climbed back into the burning sun once more.<br><br>&#x201c;Why should I care what Greek peasants say?&#x201d; Maecenas muttered, though he pitched his voice too low to be heard. Maecenas was of such ancient lineage that he refused to claim descent from the twins who suckled at a she-�wolf and went on to found Rome. His people, he said, had owned the wolf. When they&#x2019;d first met, he&#x2019;d assumed Octavian had known Caesar, so a mere Roman noble could not impress him. Over time, he&#x2019;d realized Octavian took Maecenas at the value he set for himself. It was slightly galling to have to live up to his own sense of superiority. Maecenas felt that Octavian had rather missed the point of noble families. It wasn&#x2019;t who you were&#x2014;�it was who your ancestors had been that mattered. Yet somehow that simple faith was something he could not shatter in his friend. Octavian had known poverty, with his father dying early. If he thought a true Roman noble would be brave and honorable, Maecenas didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint him.<br><br>Maecenas sighed at the thought. They wore simple tunics and darker leggings. Any clothing was too hot for climbing in the noon sun, but the leggings were terrible, already dark with perspiration. He was convinced he&#x2019;d rubbed himself raw under them. He could smell his own sweat as he climbed and skidded down, wrinkling his nose in distaste. The scabbard of his sword caught in a crevice and Maecenas swore as he freed it. His expression darkened as he heard Agrippa laugh behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;I am glad to provide some amusement for you, Agrippa,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;The pleasures of this day are now complete.&#x201d;<br><br>Agrippa gave a tight smile without replying as he came level and then went past, using his great strength and size to take enormous steps down the crag. The fleet centurion was a head taller than his companions and the constant labor on board Roman galleys had only increased the power in his arms and legs. He made the climb look easy and was still breathing lightly by the time he reached the bottom. Octavian was a few steps behind and the pair waited for Maecenas as he clambered down after them.<br><br>&#x201c;You realize we&#x2019;ll have to go back up that hill again when we turn around?&#x201d; Maecenas said as he jumped the last few feet.<br><br>Octavian groaned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to argue with you, Maecenas. It would be easier if you just accepted we are doing this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Without complaining,&#x201d; Agrippa added. His deep voice echoed back from the stone all around them and Maecenas looked sourly at them both.<br><br>&#x201c;There are a thousand different paths through these cursed rocks,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;I should think the bandits are far away from here by now, sipping cool drinks while we die of thirst.&#x201d;<br><br>Gleefully, Agrippa pointed at the dusty ground and Maecenas looked down, seeing the footprints of many men.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. He drew his sword in a smooth motion, as if he expected an immediate attack. &#x201c;Probably local herders, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Octavian replied, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re the only ones following this path, so I would like to be sure.&#x201d; He too drew his gladius, shorter than Maecenas&#x2019;s duelist&#x2019;s blade by a hand&#x2019;s breadth, but well oiled, so that it slid free with barely a whisper. He could feel the heat of the blade.<br><br>Agrippa freed his own sword and together the three men walked silently into the canyon ahead, placing their steps with caution. Without planning it, Octavian took the lead, with Agrippa&#x2019;s bulk on his right shoulder and Maecenas on his left. Ever since they had become friends, Octavian had led the group as if there were no alternative. It was the kind of natural confidence Maecenas appreciated and recognized. Old families had to start somewhere, even when they began with a Caesar. He smiled at the thought, though the expression froze as they came around a spire of rock and saw men waiting for them in the shadows. Octavian walked on without a jerk, keeping his sword lowered. Three more steps brought him into the gloom of the chasm, with rock walls stretching up above their heads. He came to a halt, looking coldly at the men in his way.<br><br>There was another path out on the other side and Maecenas noticed laden mules waiting patiently. The men they faced did not seem surprised or afraid, perhaps because there were eight of them, staring with bright-�eyed interest at the three young Romans. The biggest of the men raised a sword from another age, a great length of iron that was more like a cleaver than anything else. He sported a black beard that reached right down to his chest and Maecenas could see the bulge of heavy muscles under a ragged jerkin as he moved. The man grinned at them, revealing missing teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a very long way from your friends,&#x201d; the man said in Greek.<br><br>Maecenas knew the language, though Octavian and Agrippa spoke not a word. Neither of them looked around with so many blades being pointed in their direction, but Maecenas could feel their expectation.<br><br>&#x201c;Must I translate?&#x201d; he said, dredging up the words from his memory. &#x201c;I know the high speech, but your peasant accent is so thick, I can hardly understand you. It is like the grunting of a dying mule. Speak slowly and clearly, as if you were apologizing to your master.&#x201d;<br><br>The man looked at him in surprise, anger darkening his face. He was aware that the death of Romans would make him a wanted man, but the mountains had hidden bodies before and would again. He tilted his head slightly, weighing his choices.<br><br>&#x201c;We want the one who raped and strangled the woman,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;Hand him over to us and go back to your short and pointless lives.&#x201d;<br><br>The leader of the bandits growled deep in his throat and took a step forward.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you saying to him?&#x201d; Octavian asked without taking his eyes off the man.<br><br>&#x201c;I am praising his fine beard,&#x201d; Maecenas replied. &#x201c;I have never seen one like it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maecenas!&#x201d; Octavian snapped. &#x201c;It has to be them. Just find out if he knows the one we came to find.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, beard? Do you know the one we want?&#x201d; Maecenas went on, switching languages.<br><br>&#x201c;I am the one you want, Roman,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But if you have come here alone, you have made a mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>The bandit looked up the rocks to the blue sky, searching for any hint of a moving shadow that would reveal an ambush or a trap. He grunted, satisfied, then glanced at his sharp-�eyed companions. One of them was dark and thin, his face dominated by a great blade of a nose. In response, the man shrugged, raising a dagger with unmistakable intent.<br><br>Octavian stepped forward without warning of any kind. With a vicious flick, he brought his sword across so that it cut the throat of the closest man to him. The man dropped his dagger to hold his neck with both hands, suddenly choking as he fell to his knees.<br><br>The leader of the bandits froze, then gave a great bellow of rage with the rest of his men. He raised his sword for a crushing blow, but Agrippa jumped in, gripping the sword arm with his left hand and stabbing his short blade up between the man&#x2019;s ribs. The leader collapsed like a punctured wineskin, falling onto his back with an echoing crash.<br><br>For a heartbeat, the bandits hesitated, shocked by the explosion of violence and death. Octavian had not stopped moving. He killed another gaping bandit with a backhand stroke against his throat, chopping into flesh. He&#x2019;d set his feet well and brought the whole of his strength into the blow, so that it almost decapitated the man. The gladius was made for such work and the weight felt good in his hand.<br><br>The rest might have run then, if their way hadn&#x2019;t been blocked by their own mules. Forced to stand, they fought with vicious intensity for desperate moments as the three Romans lunged and darted among them. All three had been trained from a young age. They were professional soldiers and the bandits were more used to frightening villagers who would not dare to raise a blade against them. They fought hard but uselessly, seeing their blades knocked away and then unable to stop the return blows cutting them. The small canyon was filled with grunting and gasping as the bandits were cut down in short, chopping blows. None of the Romans was armored, but they stood close to one another, protecting their left sides as the swords rose and fell, with warm blood slipping off the warmer steel.<br><br>It was over in a dozen heartbeats and Octavian, Agrippa, and Maecenas were alone and panting. Octavian and Agrippa were both bleeding from gashes on their arms, but they were unaware of the wounds, still grim-�eyed with the violence.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take the heads back,&#x201d; Octavian said. &#x201c;The woman&#x2019;s husband will want to see them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All of them?&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;One is enough, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>Octavian looked at his friend, then reached out and gripped his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thank you. But we can make a sack from their clothing. I want that village to know that Romans killed these men. They will remember&#x2014;�and I suspect they will break out the casks of their best wine and slaughter a couple of goats or pigs as well. You might even find a willing girl. Just take the heads.&#x201d;<br><br>Maecenas grimaced. He&#x2019;d spent his childhood with servants to attend to every whim, yet somehow Octavian had him working and sweating like a house slave. If his old tutors could see him, they would be standing in slack-�jawed amazement.<br><br>&#x201c;The daughters have mustaches as thick as their fathers&#x2019;,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Perhaps when it&#x2019;s fully dark, but not before.&#x201d;<br><br>With a scowl, he began the grisly work of cutting heads. Agrippa joined him, bringing his sword down in great hacking blows to break through bone.<br><br>Octavian knelt next to the body of the bandit leader, looking down into the glazed eyes for a moment. He nodded to himself, playing over the movements of the fight in his head and only then noticing the gash on his arm that was still bleeding heavily. At twenty years old, it was not the first time he&#x2019;d been cut. It was just one more scar to add to the rest. He began to chop the head free, using the oily beard to hold it steady.<br><br>The horses were still there when they came back, parched and staggering, with their tongues swelling in their mouths. It was sunset by the time the three Romans reached the village, with two sopping red sacks that dribbled their contents with every step. The local men had returned angry and empty-�handed, but the mood changed when Octavian opened the sacks onto the road, sending heads tumbling into the dust. The woman&#x2019;s husband embraced and kissed him with tears in his eyes, breaking off only to dash the heads against the wall of his house, then crushing Octavian to him once more. There was no need to translate as they left the man and his children to their mourning.<br><br>The other villagers brought food and drinks from cool cellars, setting up rough tables in the evening air so that they could feast the young men. As Octavian had imagined, he and his friends could hardly move for good meat and a clear drink that tasted of aniseed. They drank with no thought for the morning, matching the local men cup for cup until the village swam and blurred before their eyes. Very few of the villagers could speak Roman, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to matter.<br><br>Through a drunken haze, Octavian became aware that Maecenas was repeating a question to him. He listened blearily, then gave a laugh, which turned into a curse at his own clumsiness as he spilled his cup.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe that,&#x201d; he told Maecenas. &#x201c;They call it the eternal city for a reason. There will be Romans here for a thousand years, longer. Or do you think some other nation will rise up and be our masters?&#x201d; He watched his cup being refilled with beady concentration.<br><br>&#x201c;Athens, Sparta, Thebes . . .&#x201d; Maecenas replied, counting on his fingers. &#x201c;Names of gold, Octavian. No doubt the men of those cities thought the same. When Alexander was wasting his life in battles abroad, do you think he would have believed Romans would one day rule their lands from coast to coast? He would have laughed like a donkey, much as you are doing.&#x201d; Maecenas smiled as he spoke, enjoying making his friend splutter into his cup with each outrageous comment.<br><br>&#x201c;Wasting his life?&#x201d; Octavian said when he had recovered from coughing. &#x201c;You are seriously suggesting Alexander the Great could have spent his years more fruitfully? I will not rise to it. I will be a stern and noble Roman, too . . .&#x201d; He paused. The drink had muddled his thoughts. &#x201c;Too stern and noble to listen to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alexander had the greedy fingers of a merchant,&#x201d; Maecenas said. &#x201c;Always busy, busy, and what did it get him? All those years of fighting, but if he had ...</p><h2>Silver Silence (Psy-Changeling Trinity)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Nalini Singh returns to her</b> <b>extraordinary Psy-Changeling world with a story of wild passion and</b> <b>darkest betrayal...</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Control.

As the director of the worldwide Emergency Response Network run under the aegis of the Trinity Accord, Silver was the one who coordinated all available resources&#x2014;and in this part of the world, that included the StoneWater bears.</p><p>Of course, she had no ability to order them to do anything&#x2014;trying that on a predatory changeling was an exercise in abject failure. But she could ask. So far, the bears had always come through. The data crystal would tell her how many clan members and/or other resources had been required to manage each instance; it would help her fine-tune her requests in the future.</p><p>She took the crystal, not bothering to ask why the alpha of the clan had turned up to personally deliver the data.</p><p>Valentin liked to do things his way.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does Selenka let you get away with breaching her territory?&#x201d; The BlackEdge wolves had control over this part of Moscow when it came to changeling access. The city was split evenly between the wolf pack and the bear clan, with the rest of their respective territories heading outward from that central dividing line.</p><p>This apartment building fell in the wolf half.</p><p>Valentin smiled, night-dark eyes alight in a way she couldn&#x2019;t describe. &#x201c;StoneWater and BlackEdge are friends now.&#x201d;</p><p>If Silver had felt emotion, she may have made a face of sheer disbelief. The two most powerful packs in Russia had a working relationship and no longer clashed in violent confrontations, but they were not friends. &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; she said, refusing to look away from those onyx eyes.</p><p>Predatory changelings sometimes took a lack of eye contact as submissive behavior, even when interacting with non-changelings. Bears definitely took it as submissive behavior. They weren&#x2019;t exactly subtle about it either. In fact, bears were the least subtle of the changelings she&#x2019;d met through her work as Kaleb Krychek&#x2019;s senior aide, and as the head of EmNet.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you see, Starlight?&#x201d; Valentin asked in his deep rumble of a voice that spoke of the animal that lived under his skin.</p><p>Silver refused to react to the name he insisted on calling her. When she&#x2019;d pointed out he was being discourteous by not using her actual name, he&#x2019;d told her to call him her medvezhonok, her teddy bear, that he wouldn&#x2019;t mind. It was difficult to have a rational conversation with a man who seemed impossible to insult or freeze out.</p><p>Bears.</p><p>She&#x2019;d heard Selenka Durev say that through tightly clenched teeth on more than one occasion. While Silver&#x2019;s conditioning under the Silence Protocol remained pristine, her mind clear of all emotion, in the time she&#x2019;d known Valentin, she&#x2019;d come to understand the wolf alpha&#x2019;s reaction. &#x201c;Thank you for the data,&#x201d; she said to him now. &#x201c;Next time, you might wish to consider an invention we in the civilized world call e-mail.&#x201d;</p><p>His laugh was so big it filled the air, filled the entire space of her apartment.</p><p>The thought made no sense, yet it appeared like clockwork when Valentin laughed in her vicinity. She&#x2019;d told herself multiple times that she worked for the most powerful man in the world; Valentin was only a changeling alpha. Unfortunately, it appeared changeling alphas had their own potent brand of charisma. And this bear alpha had a surfeit of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you thought about my offer?&#x201d; he asked, the laughter still in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;The answer remains the same,&#x201d; Silver said as a burn spread through her chest. &#x201c;I do not wish to go have ice cream with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really good ice cream.&#x201d; Smile disappearing, Valentin suddenly shifted fully upright from his leaning position against the doorjamb, the size and muscle of him dangerously apparent. &#x201c;You doing okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quite fine,&#x201d; Silver said, even as the burn morphed into a jagged spike. Something was wrong. She had to contact&#x2014;</p><p>Her brain shorted out. She was aware of her body beginning to spasm, her lungs gasping for air as her legs crumpled, but she couldn&#x2019;t get her telepathic &#x201c;muscles&#x201d; to work, couldn&#x2019;t contact her family or Kaleb for an emergency teleport.</p><p>Moving far faster than most people expected bear changelings to move, Valentin caught Silver&#x2019;s slender body before she&#x2019;d done much more than sway on those ice-pick heels she liked to wear. He knew it wasn&#x2019;t the heels that were toppling her; Silver was never in any danger on those heels. The woman walked on them like he walked on his &#x201c;bigfoot-sized&#x201d; feet, as described by one of his three older sisters.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got you, Starlight,&#x201d; he said, scooping her up in his arms and walking into her apartment.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been trying to get in for ten long months, ever since he first met Ms. Silver Mercant. But he&#x2019;d never expected it to be because she was convulsing in his arms. Placing her on the dark gray of the sofa, he turned her onto her side and gripped her jaw to keep her head from jerking too hard. At least she was breathing, though the sound was ragged.</p><p>With his other hand, he grabbed his phone, went to call Kaleb Krychek. The viciously powerful telekinetic could get her to help far faster than any ambulance. But Silver&#x2019;s body was spasming too violently for him to both hold the phone and keep her from hurting herself. Swearing under his breath, he dropped the phone and placed his other hand on her hip, holding her in place.</p><p>&#x201c;Not how I wanted to put my hands on you, moyo solnyshko.&#x201d; He kept talking so she&#x2019;d know she wasn&#x2019;t alone, but his blood was chilling with every second that passed. It was going on too long.</p><p>Deciding to risk it, he released her hip and, snatching up his phone, managed to make the call. &#x201c;Silver&#x2019;s apartment,&#x201d; he said to the pitiless son of a bitch who was Silver&#x2019;s boss. &#x201c;Medical emergency.&#x201d;</p><p>He dropped the phone as Silver jerked again. &#x201c;Hold on, Starlight,&#x201d; he ordered in his most obnoxiously alpha voice, trying to keep her body from wrenching painfully at the same time. If Silver was going to respond to anything, it would be to the idea that he&#x2019;d dared give her an order. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re tougher than this.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes, that glorious silver, met his, the pupils huge&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. right before her body went limp.</p><p>Kaleb appeared in the room at the same instant, the Psy male dressed in a flawless black-on-black suit. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he asked, his voice as cold as midnight on the steppes.</p><p>&#x201c;Get her to a doctor,&#x201d; Valentin growled, the sound coming from the human male&#x2019;s vocal cords but carrying the bear&#x2019;s rage. &#x201c;Tell them it was poison.&#x201d;</p><p>Kaleb was smart enough not to waste time questioning him. He simply teleported out, taking Silver with him. Teeth gritted at the fact she was out of his sight, Valentin got up and, going into Silver&#x2019;s kitchen, began to pull out anything that could be food. Psy had strange ideas of food&#x2014;meal bars and nutrient mixes. The only surprise in Silver&#x2019;s cupboard was a block of fine dark chocolate.</p><p>Wondering if he&#x2019;d discovered a secret about the most fascinating woman he&#x2019;d ever met, a secret he could use to sneak past her defenses&#x2014;no, he had no shame whatsoever when it came to Silver Mercant&#x2014;he turned over the block and found a small card still attached to it. The writing was in English. It said: Thank you for your assistance, Ms. Mercant. I hope you enjoy this small taste of our family business. ~Rico Cavalier</p><p>His bear rumbled inside his chest.</p><p>This was the kind of gift a man gave a woman he was interested in&#x2014;but it looked like this Rico had struck out if the chocolate was sitting in the back of what passed for Silver&#x2019;s pantry.</p><p>Good. Otherwise, I&#x2019;d have had to pound the fool into dust.</p><p>The only one courting Starlight was going to be Valentin.</p><p>Having collected all possible food items, including some bland-looking &#x201c;cake&#x201d; from the cooler that was probably a nutrient-dense protein supplement, he began to go through them. Changelings had the sharpest noses of the three races.</p><p>Bears had the sharpest noses among changelings.</p><p>Nothing would escape him now that he&#x2019;d pinpointed the poisonous scent from the millions of others in the air at any one time: the exemplar had come from Silver, her body screaming a warning to his senses as the poison went active.</p><p>&#x201c;Hungry, Alpha Nikolaev?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t start at Krychek&#x2019;s midnight voice, having scented the cardinal telekinetic&#x2019;s return to the room. Thankfully for his nose, Kaleb didn&#x2019;t have the astringent metallic scent that some Psy did, the ones who were so deep in the emotionless regime they called Silence that Valentin didn&#x2019;t think anything would get them out.</p><p>It was as if they&#x2019;d cut out their hearts and souls.</p><p>Silver was pure ice, but she didn&#x2019;t have that metallic scent either. It gave him hope. As did the faint touch of fire he kept picking up around her, a hidden sunshine that flickered against his skin. Valentin was determined to seduce Silver&#x2019;s hidden wildness out into the light. Who better than an uncivilized bear after all?</p><p>&#x201c;How is she?&#x201d; he asked, looking Krychek in the eye.</p><p>The telekinetic&#x2019;s gaze was the eerie white stars on black that denoted the strongest among the Psy race, difficult to read even if it hadn&#x2019;t been Kaleb Krychek&#x2014;a man Valentin respected for his relentless will but mostly for his unexpected capacity for loyalty.</p><p>StoneWater did its research on possible business partners. Valentin, a young second to Zoya at the time Krychek first appeared on StoneWater&#x2019;s radar, was the one who&#x2019;d dug into the Psy male. And what he&#x2019;d discovered about Krychek was that if you didn&#x2019;t betray him, he wouldn&#x2019;t betray you.</p><p>Valentin could work with a man like that.</p><p>Especially since Krychek had had the good sense to employ Silver.</p><p>The words the telekinetic spoke were toneless. &#x201c;The medics are working on stabilizing her.&#x201d;</p><p>Valentin&#x2019;s gut clenched.</p><p>A deep rumbling building in his chest, he held out a barely used jar of nutrient mix. &#x201c;This has the same toxic scent as what I scented on her&#x2014;get it tested. I&#x2019;m going to finish checking the other items.&#x201d;</p><p>Kaleb left at once, no doubt aware that, to treat Silver effectively, the medics needed to know the type of poison she&#x2019;d ingested. Because while Valentin could tell something was toxic, he couldn&#x2019;t separate out individual poisonous scents&#x2014;not when he&#x2019;d never made it a point to learn those gradations.</p><p>He saw the half-full glass on the counter, realized he&#x2019;d interrupted Silver at breakfast. He didn&#x2019;t need to lift the glass to his nose to scent the toxins swirling in the coffee-colored liquid. If he&#x2019;d been here, he would&#x2019;ve smashed that glass out of her hand before a drop touched her lips.</p><p>Jaw grinding, he handed the glass to Krychek when the other man returned. The third time Krychek came back, Valentin had found a second contaminated jar of nutrient mix. &#x201c;It was the third from the front on the right-hand side,&#x201d; he said, knowing the location of the poisoned jars might be important. &#x201c;The nutrient bars were clean.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d ruthlessly opened each and every packet, exposing them to the air and to his nose. &#x201c;Silver&#x2019;s going to be mad I trashed her kitchen.&#x201d;</p><p>Kaleb took the jar, examined the label, then teleported out with it. When he returned, he said, &#x201c;That was ordinary nutrient mix available at any Psy grocer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You thinking product tampering?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a possibility&#x2014;those of my race are not universally liked.&#x201d;</p><p>That was a vast understatement. Many of the Psy might be attempting to regain their emotions after more than a hundred years of training themselves to feel nothing, but their previous rulers had done massive damage, killed and tortured and created a deep vein of ill will.</p><p>Both humans and changelings had long memories.</p><p>&#x201c;The other option is an assassination attempt.&#x201d; Krychek&#x2019;s...</p></p><h2>Trigun Maximum Volume 9: LR (Trigun Maximum)</h2><p>This is the story of Nicholas Wolfwood and Livio, two boys for whom friendship was brief, but still burned deep into their boyhood conciences.

Much of humanity now seems separated by chasms of incomprehension. Kwame Anthony Appiah's landmark new work challenges the separatist doctrines espoused in books such as Samuel P. Huntington's <i>The Clash of Civilizations</i>. Reviving the ancient philosophy of "Cosmopolitanism," a school of thought that dates to the Cynics of the fourth century bce, Appiah traces its influence on the ethical legacies of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, Kant's dream of a "league of nations," and the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In doing so, Appiah shows how Western intellectuals and leaders, on both the left and the right, have wildly exaggerated the power of difference&#x2014;and neglected the power of one. One world. One species. Challenging years of received wisdom, <i>Cosmopolitanism</i> is a resounding work of philosophy and global culture. <br><br><b>About the series: Issues of Our Time</b>: "Aware of the competition for the attention of readers, W. W. Norton &amp; Company and I have created the "Issues of Our Time" as a lucid series of highly readable books through which some of today's most thoughtful intellectuals seek to challenge the general reader to reexamine received truths and grapple with powerful trends that are shaping the world in which we live. The series launches with Anthony Appiah, Alan Dershowitz, and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen as the first of an illustrious group who will tackle some of the most plangent and central issues defining our society today through books that deal with such issues as sexual and racial identities, the economics of the developing world, and the concept of citizenship in a truly globalized twenty-first-century world culture. Above all else, these books are designed to be read and enjoyed."&#x2014;Henry Louis Gates Jr., W. E. B. DuBois Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University</p><p><b>Kwame Anthony Appiah</b>, professor of philosophy at Princeton University, was raised in Ghana and educated at Clare College, Cambridge. His books include <i>In My Father's House, Thinking It Through</i>, and <i>The Ethics of Identity</i>. With Henry Louis Gates Jr., he is the editor of <i>Africana.</i>In a world more interconnected than ever, the responsibilities and obligations we share remain matters of volatile debate. Weighing in on a discourse that includes both visions of "clashing civilizations" and often equally misguided cultural relativism, Ghana-born Princeton philosopher Appiah (<i>In My Father's House</i>) reclaims a tradition of creative exchange and imaginative engagement across lines of difference. This cosmopolitan ethic, which he traces from the Greek Cynics and through to the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, must inevitably balance universals with respect for particulars. This balance comes through "conversation," a term Appiah uses literally and metaphorically to signal the depth of encounters across national, religious and other forms of identity. At the same time, Appiah stresses conversation needn't involve consensus, since living together mostly entails just getting used to one another. Amid the good and bad of globalization, the author parses some basic cultural-philosophical beliefs&#x2014;drawing frequent examples from his own far-flung multicultural family as well as from impersonal relationships of exchange and power&#x2014;to focus due attention on widespread and unexamined assumptions about identity, difference and morality. A stimulating read, leavened by cheerful, fluid prose, the book will challenge fashionable theories of irreconcilable divides with a practical and pragmatic worldview that revels in difference and the adventure of a shared humanity. This is an excellent start to Norton's new Issues of Our Time series. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their first job together was to dispose of a dangerous piece of radioactive material shaped like a plain gold Ring. Unfortunately the Ring once belonged to a rather irascible mogul (the Chairman of the Board of Barad-dur, Ltd.) who was determined to get it back. Behr and Wolfe&#39;s friendship grew over the course of their long and peril-fraught journey. Together they traveled through Eriador, climbed Caradhras Mountain, wandered the Dimrill Dale, and kayaked the Anduin River, on a seemingly endless quest across the globe. Finally, broke, tired, and possessed of a desperate urge to write for television, the two friends tossed the Ring into a fiery pit (just outside Las Vegas, Nevada} and moved to Hollywood. Now they spend their time happily eating six meals a day, combing their furry feet, and writing numerous episodes of the popular syndicated series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.</p><h2>War Torn: Stories of War from the Women Reporters Who Covered Vietnam</h2><p>For the first time, nine women who made journalism history talk candidly about their professional and deeply personal experiences as young reporters who lived, worked, and loved surrounded by war. Their stories span a decade of America&#x2019;s involvement in Vietnam, from the earliest days of the conflict until the last U.S. helicopters left Saigon in 1975. <br><br>They were gutsy risk-takers who saw firsthand what most Americans knew only from their morning newspapers or the evening news. Many had very particular reasons for going to Vietnam&#x2014;some had to fight and plead to go&#x2014;but others ended up there by accident. What happened to them was remarkable and important by any standard. Their lives became exciting beyond anything they had ever imagined, and the experience never left them. It was dangerous&#x2014;one was wounded, and one was captured by the North Vietnamese&#x2014;but the challenges they faced were uniquely rewarding.<br><br>They lived at full tilt, making an impact on all the people around them, from the orphan children in the streets to their fellow journalists and photographers to the soldiers they met and lived with in the field. They experienced anguish and heartbreak&#x2014;and an abundance <br>of friendship and love. These stories not only introduce a remarkable group of individuals but give an entirely new perspective on the most controversial conflict in our history. Vietnam changed their lives forever. Here they tell about it with all the candor, commitment, and energy that characterized their courageous reporting during the war.</p><p>&#x201c;This book is about our experiences as women reporters covering the Vietnam War from 1966 until the fall of Saigon, in 1975. Each of us has written a chapter about what we saw and felt in Indochina&#x2014;our adventures, fears, excitement, and the difficulties and loneliness.<br><br>&#x201c;Vietnam was a unique war for all journalists, because there was no censorship. The U.S. military provided extraordinary access to combat operations. We could fly on bombing missions, parachute into hostile territory with an airborne unit, spend a week with the Special Forces in the jungle, hitch a ride on a chopper and land amid rocket and artillery as a battle raged, or be taken prisoner like a soldier. This access gave women reporters a chance to show that they could cover combat bravely and honorably, holding their own even under the most frightening and stressful circumstances.<br><br>&#x201c;Some of us went on to cover other wars, but there was never any other quite like Vietnam. We are writing about Vietnam now because we feel it is important to keep those agonizing yet strangely exhilarating days alive, those dark days that changed us in ways we are still trying to understand. Many younger Americans know Vietnam only as an abstraction&#x2014;a few paragraphs in a textbook, a documentary on the History Channel, or as thousands of names on a black granite wall in Washington, D.C. But for those who served and those who suffered, for those who fought and those who watched it unfold on television, Vietnam will always be a part of us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;<b>from <i>War Torn</i></b><b>From <i>Walking Point</i><br>by Denby Fawcett<br></b><br><i>Those were the days when all of us were young, <br>very pure, and very sincere.<br></i>&#x2013;Bao Ninh<br><br><b>The Sorrow of War<br></b>One afternoon in the fall of 1966, I went to the Saigon Zoo. Walking past the cages of lethargic, dusty animals, I was drawn to a group of Vietnamese soldiers standing around a cement pit. They were watching two captive bears dancing on their hind legs, begging for candy and fruit. The soldiers threw the bears peanuts; then one of them casually tossed a lighted cigarette into a bear&#x2019;s mouth. The soldiers laughed as the bear struggled to cough up the burning cigarette.<br><br>In Vietnam, I tried hard not to dwell on the plight of the poor bears or think too long about the dramatic deaths of friends I expected to know forever. There was no forever there . . . just one surprise after another. You had to fortify yourself for what was coming next. Only now, so many years later, do images drift back with mighty and haunting force.<br><br>In the night when I can&#x2019;t sleep, I see the smiling face of my friend Riley Leroy Pitts, the handsome black army captain we called Pittsie Old Boy, a Medal of Honor winner. Pittsie threw himself on a grenade to save his men at Ap Dong, a dud Chinese grenade that failed to explode. After escaping death once, Pittsie got up off the ground and moved forward to kill the Vietcong machine gunners who had trapped his company in a jungle so thick, they could not fire back effectively. Pittsie Old Boy, dead at age thirty, mortally wounded while trying to prevent the Vietcong from shooting more of his men.<br><br>On other restless nights, I hear the voices of marines at the Rockpile near the demilitarized zone saying, &#x201c;They must have paid you a fortune to come here.&#x201d; The truth is, I paid my own way to the war and initially made so little money, I had to carefully count what I spent for books, clothes, and rent.<br><br>Covering the Vietnam War was the pivotal event of my life. Yet in the years afterward, I never mentioned my days on helicopter assaults, my fear of getting shot in the face, or the heady social life in Saigon for the same reason most soldiers kept quiet. It was a &#x201c;bad war.&#x201d; Nobody wanted to hear about it, and even if they did, they wouldn&#x2019;t understand.<br>I don&#x2019;t think any of us were prepared for what we would see in Vietnam. I went to the war in May 1966, as a merry explorer, a journalistic kind of person, plagued with a short attention span and an unstoppable curiosity. I was twenty-four years old, the oldest child of an artistic mother and a father in the advertising business, glamorous and brilliant people who loved me dearly. They urged me to always keep one step ahead of comfort, and from them I learned the benefits and perils of making friends with the untamed side of yourself.<br>I decided I must go to Vietnam when The Honolulu Advertiser sent my then boyfriend, and many years later husband, Bob Jones, to cover the war. The Honolulu morning paper wanted a reporter in Vietnam to do stories on Hawaii&#x2019;s 25th Infantry Division, a local unit deployed to Cu Chi between Saigon and the Cambodian border, and in Pleiku in the Central Highlands. Hawaii, with its large military population, had a focused interest in the war.<br><br>Just out of Columbia University, I was languishing as a reporter on the evening Honolulu Star-Bulletin women&#x2019;s page, assigned to write features and to help the paper&#x2019;s star society reporter cover Honolulu social events. I yearned to be part of Vietnam, the biggest news story of my generation. Yet I was stuck wearing a borrowed evening gown to cover the Junior League ball or busy taking endless notes at the Chinese Narcissus Festival. My single goal in heading for Saigon was to remake my destiny.<br><br>My Star-Bulletin editors thought I was joking when I asked them to free me from the society pages to cover the Vietnam War. They said it was out of the question, so I quit my $80-a-week job and I was ready to leave for Vietnam as a freelancer when, at the last minute, Honolulu Advertiser managing editor Buck Buchwach took a chance and hired me as one of his reporters. Buchwach told me I would have to pay my own way to Saigon but <br>promised me a letter of accreditation and $35 for each article I wrote.<br><br>When I told my parents I was going to Vietnam, they were worried, but rather than try to discourage me, they kept their concerns to themselves. They were friendly extroverts who loved to throw parties on the lawn of our big Honolulu beach house. But between the parties they could be extremely sensitive. My mother read a book a night during the periods when she could concentrate, momentarily free of her episodes of manic depression, a disease that scared us and sometimes swept her away from us when we were children.<br>My father, a bookish man himself, loved British mystery stories and his volumes of Walt Whitman, lovingly preserved from his days as a Stanford University student. His own darkness was binge drinking&#x2013;usually two-day-long spells he referred to as &#x201c;toots&#x201d;&#x2013;confusing my brothers and me as we watched him bounce back from the alcoholic binges, miraculously transformed into the thoughtful and kind father he was before.<br>Both my mother and father were quietly withdrawn as I prepared to leave for the war. I remember the night before I departed walking into my father&#x2019;s dressing room on the first floor of our house to find him sitting in the twilight in boxer shorts, staring at the wall, the TV set across from him turned off. He brooded by himself, knowing there was nothing he could do to protect me from the danger ahead. The room was shadowy and silent, the only sound the waves crashing on the beach in front of our house.<br><br>I packed my suitcase with sundresses recently shortened to the appropriate 1960s mini length by my mother&#x2019;s Japanese dressmaker, sandals, pearls, dark glasses, and a bathing suit. I had no idea what to bring to a war.<br><br>When I arrived at Saigon&#x2019;s Tan Son Nhut airport, hundreds of soldiers were pouring out of planes&#x2013;the American presence in Vietnam would double by the end of the year from two hundred thousand to four hundred thousand troops. The only other women in the airport were Vietnamese customs officials. Everyone stared at me. The American embassy listed 758 American women in South Vietnam at the time. Until then, I had spent my life happily unnoticed in the background. The constant attention was unnerving.<br><br>The Honolulu Advertiser&#x2019;s Saigon bureau was in Bob&#x2019;s two-room apartment near An Quang Buddhist pagoda, the headquarters of the monk Thich Tri Quang, an outspoken critic of the Saigon government. I bought a Chinese bike for $20 to get around the city; the bike made me feel vulnerable and exposed if I happened to ride home at the same time that government troops were tear gassing our neighborhood to quell the pagoda&#x2019;s frequent antigovernment demonstrations. During the tear gassings, helpful Vietnamese bicyclists signaled me to follow them down side alleys and lanes to escape the acrid air.<br>Besides the tear gas, there were also blackouts. In a botched attempt to tame the rebellious monks at the pagoda, South Vietnamese officials cut off electricity to our neighborhood almost every night. The enforced darkness only strengthened the monks&#x2019; resolve and, for us, heightened our sense of adventure and romance as we typed our news stories by candlelight.<br><br>The Advertiser promoted my presence in Vietnam as a reporter &#x201c;specializing in color stories on Saigon and its environs.&#x201d; A story in the paper informed readers I would do &#x201c;articles on men and women who are lending their teaching, building and medical skills to winning the peace.&#x201d; I was supposed to remain in the safety of Saigon writing features; Bob was to take care of the dangerous war coverage.<br><br>It was easy to find bizarre feature stories. One of my first pieces was on tourism in Vietnam, a report I later sold to the Saturday Review magazine. With a shooting war in full swing, the South Vietnamese government continued to spend money to promote tourism. The Vietnam National Tourist Bureau opened its doors each morning in a musty office next to the Majestic Hotel on the north bank of the Saigon River. Pamphlets on the counter proclaimed Saigon as &#x201c;the Pearl of the Orient.&#x201d; My favorite pamphlet urged tourists to come to Vietnam . . . a hunter&#x2019;s paradise &#x201c;with game filled areas 50 to 250 miles from Saigon.&#x201d; A red-lettered stamp across the top cautioned: &#x201c;Temporarily suspended under the present situation.&#x201d;<br><br>Any American could visit Vietnam without a visa if he stayed for less than seven days. Pan American World Airways offered five flights a week to Saigon from Hawaii and the continental United States. Tourists did come, but not many. They were mostly hippies, druggies, or curiosity seekers such as the Dwight Folletts of Oak Park, Illinois, a couple I interviewed for my piece. Dwight was the president of Follett Publishing Company. &#x201c;We must be the only tourists here,&#x201d; he said as he and his wife sipped wine on an American friend&#x2019;s penthouse terrace. &#x201c;We came because we wanted to see what was happening in Vietnam ourselves. In the United States everything we read is either black or white.&#x201d;<br>The Folletts&#x2019; activities included watching Buddhist monks stage an antigovernment protest that broke up after the Saigon police sprayed the monks with tear gas and beat them with sticks. A few days later, the Folletts took a trip to the beach resort of Nha Trang, where they ate fresh lobster in a former French caf�. Follett told me, &#x201c;I am coming out of this more a hawk than a dove. We must help these people.&#x201d;<br><br>Two months after I arrived in Saigon, Bob departed to take a new job with KGMB-TV, the CBS News affiliate in Hawaii. At age twenty-four, I became The Honolulu Advertiser&#x2019;s chief Vietnam reporter. The paper made me a full-time...</p><h2>The Kite Runner</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Amir is desperate to win the approval of his father and resolves to win the local kite-fighting tournament, to prove that he has the makings of a man. His loyal friend Hassan promises to help him - for he always helps Amir - but this is 1970s Afghanistan and Hassan is merely a low-caste servant who is jeered at in the street, although Amir still feels jealous of his natural courage and the place he holds in his father&#39;s heart. But neither of the boys could foresee what would happen to Hassan on the afternoon of the tournament, which was to shatter their lives. After the Russians invade and the family is forced to flee to America, Amir realises that one day he must return, to find the one thing that his new world cannot grant him: redemption.</p><p>In his debut novel, <i>The Kite Runner</i>, Khaled Hosseini accomplishes what very few contemporary novelists are able to do. He manages to provide an educational and eye-opening account of a country's political turmoil--in this case, Afghanistan--while also developing characters whose heartbreaking struggles and emotional triumphs resonate with readers long after the last page has been turned over. And he does this on his first try.<p> <i>The Kite Runner</i> follows the story of Amir, the privileged son of a wealthy businessman in Kabul, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant. As children in the relatively stable Afghanistan of the early 1970s, the boys are inseparable. They spend idyllic days running kites and telling stories of mystical places and powerful warriors until an unspeakable event changes the nature of their relationship forever, and eventually cements their bond in ways neither boy could have ever predicted. Even after Amir and his father flee to America, Amir remains haunted by his cowardly actions and disloyalty. In part, it is these demons and the sometimes impossible quest for forgiveness that bring him back to his war-torn native land after it comes under Taliban rule. ("...I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.")</p><p> Some of the plot's turns and twists may be somewhat implausible, but Hosseini has created characters that seem so real that one almost forgets that <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a novel and not a memoir. At a time when Afghanistan has been thrust into the forefront of America's collective consciousness ("people sipping lattes at Starbucks were talking about the battle for Kunduz"), Hosseini offers an honest, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always heartfelt view of a fascinating land. Perhaps the only true flaw in this extraordinary novel is that it ends all too soon. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>"A wonderful work... This is one of those unforgettable stories that stay with you for years.

All this, and a rich slice of Afghan culture too: irresistible." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Like <b>Gone with the Wind</b>, this extraordinary first novel locates the personal struggles of everyday people in the terrible sweep of history.&#x201d; -- <i>People</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;To many Western readers, [Afghanistan&#x2019;s] can be an exhausting and bewildering history. But Hosseini extrudes it into an intimate account of family and friendship, betrayal and salvation that requires no atlas or translation to engage and enlighten us.&#x201d; -- <i>Washington Post</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Hosseini does tenderness and terror, California dream and Kabul nightmare with equal aplomb. . .a ripping yarn and ethical parable.&#x201d; -- <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>"A beautiful novel . . . a song in a new key. Hosseini is an exhilaratingly original writer with a gift for irony and a gentle, perceptive heart . . . one of the most lyrical, moving and unexpected novels of the year." -- <i>Denver Post</i></p><h2>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry: Anniversary Edition</h2><p>Winner of the 1977 Newbery Medal, this is a remarkably moving novel--one that has impressed the hearts and minds of millions of readers. Set in Mississippi at the height of the Depression, it is the story of one family's struggle to maintain their integrity, pride, and independence in the face of racism and social injustice. And, too, it is Cassie's story--Cassie Logan, an independent girl who discovers over the course of an important year why having land of their own is so crucial to the Logan family, even as she learns to draw strength from her own sense of dignity and self-respect. <p>"[A] vivid story.... Entirely through its own internal development, the novel shows the rich inner rewards of black pride, love, and independence." --<b>Booklist</b> (starred review)</p></p><p>In all Mildred D. Taylor's unforgettable novels she recounts "not only the joy of growing up in a large and supportive family, but my own feelings of being faced with segregation and bigotry." Her Newbery Medal-winning <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i> tells the story of one African American family, fighting to stay together and strong in the face of brutal racist attacks, illness, poverty, and betrayal in the Deep South of the 1930s. Nine-year-old Cassie Logan, growing up protected by her loving family, has never had reason to suspect that any white person could consider her inferior or wish her harm. But during the course of one devastating year when her community begins to be ripped apart by angry night riders threatening African Americans, she and her three brothers come to understand why the land they own means so much to their Papa. "Look out there, Cassie girl. All that belongs to you. You ain't never had to live on nobody's place but your own and long as I live and the family survives, you'll never have to. That's important. You may not understand that now but one day you will. Then you'll see."<p> Twenty-five years after it was first published, this special anniversary edition of the classic strikes as deep and powerful a note as ever. Taylor's vivid portrayal of ugly racism and the poignancy of Cassie's bewilderment and gradual toughening against social injustice and the men and women who perpetuate it, will remain with readers forever. Two award-winning sequels, <i>Let the Circle Be Unbroken</i> and <i>The Road to Memphis</i>, and a long-awaited prequel, <i>The Land</i>, continue the profoundly moving tale of the Logan family. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Read by Lynne Thigpen<br>Approx. 8 hours<br>6 cassettes<br><br>Why is the land so important to Cassie's family? It takes the events of one turbulent year--the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliates Cassie in public simply because she is black--to show Cassie that having a place of their own is the Logan family's lifeblood. It is the land that gives the Logans their courage and pride, for no matter how others may degrade them, the Logans possess something no one can take away.</p><h2>Britain AD: A Quest for Arthur, England and the Anglo-Saxons</h2><p><p>Leading archaeologist Francis Pryor retells the story of King Arthur, legendary king of the Britons, tracing it back to its Bronze Age origins.</p><p>The legend of King Arthur and Camelot is one of the most enduring in Britain's history, spanning centuries and surviving invasions by Angles, Vikings and Normans. In his latest book Francis Pryor &#x2013; one of Britain&#x2019;s most celebrated archaeologists and author of the acclaimed &#x2018;Britain B.C.&#x2019; and &#x2018;Seahenge&#x2019; &#x2013; traces the story of Arthur back to its ancient origins. Putting forth the compelling idea that most of the key elements of the Arthurian legends are deeply rooted in Bronze and Iron Ages (the sword Excalibur, the Lady of the Lake, the Sword in the Stone and so on), Pryor argues that the legends' survival mirrors a flourishing, indigenous culture that endured through the Roman occupation of Britain, and the subsequent invasions of the so-called Dark Ages.</p><p>As in &#x2018;Britain B.C.&#x2019;, Pryor roots his story in the very landscape, from Arthur&#x2019;s Seat in Edinburgh, to South Cadbury Castle in Somerset and Tintagel in Cornwall. He traces the story back to the 5th-century King Arthur and beyond, all the time testing his ideas with archaeological evidence, and showing how the story was manipulated through the ages for various historical and literary purposes, by Geoffrey of Monmouth and Malory, among others.</p><p>Delving into history, literary sources &#x2013; ancient, medieval and romantic &#x2013; and archaeological research, Francis Pryor creates an original, lively and illuminating account of this most British of legends.</p></p><p><p>Dr Francis Pryor has spent thirty years studying the prehistory of the Fens. He has excavated sites as diverse as Bronze Age farms, field systems and entire Iron Age villages. From 1980 he turned his attention to pre-Roman religion and has excavated barrows, &#x2018;henges&#x2019;, and a large ceremonial centre dating to 3800 bc. In 1982, while working in a drainage dyke at Flag Fen, on the outskirts of Peterborough, he discovered the waterlogged timbers of a Bronze Age religious site. In 1987, with his wife Maisie Taylor, he set up the Fenland Archaeological Trust, which opened Flag Fen to the public.</p><p>&#x2018;Controversial deceptively clever and a damn good read.&#x2019; BBC History Magazine</p><p>Praise for &#x2018;Britain B.C.&#x2019;:</p><p>&#x2018;Francis Pryor has given us a remarkable, imaginative and persuasive account of those other Britons...its enthusiastic and confident approach deserves to be very influential.&#x2019; TLS</p><p>&#x2018;A compulsive narrative intertwining prehistory, the excitement of discovery and personalities.

Many believe that this shift began with the "tough on crime" policies advocated by Republicans and southern Democrats beginning in the late 1960s, which sought longer prison sentences, more frequent use of the death penalty, and the explicit or implicit targeting of politically marginalized people. In <em>The First Civil Right</em>, Naomi Murakawa inverts the conventional wisdom by arguing that the expansion of the federal carceral state-a system that disproportionately imprisons blacks and Latinos-was, in fact, rooted in the civil-rights liberalism of the 1940s and early 1960s, not in the period after.<br><br>Murakawa traces the development of the modern American prison system through several presidencies, both Republican and Democrat. Responding to calls to end the lawlessness and violence against blacks at the state and local levels, the Truman administration expanded the scope of what was previously a weak federal system. Later administrations from Johnson to Clinton expanded the federal presence even more. Ironically, these steps laid the groundwork for the creation of the vast penal archipelago that now exists in the United States. What began as a liberal initiative to curb the mob violence and police brutality that had deprived racial minorities of their 'first civil right-physical safety-eventually evolved into the federal correctional system that now deprives them, in unjustly large numbers, of another important right: freedom. <em>The First Civil Right </em>is a groundbreaking analysis of root of the conflicts that lie at the intersection of race and the legal system in America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Naomi Murakawa </strong>is Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University.<br><br>"This brilliant book provides persuasive arguments and powerful analysis of how racial liberals deploy racial pity and 'neutral' administrative procedures to entrench images of black criminality and expand the US carceral state. Murakawa stands in the lineage of Angela Davis, Loic Waquant and Michelle Alexander in laying bare the disturbing contradiction between American ideals of criminal justice and American practices of state-sanctioned carceral violence against black people." <br> -- Cornel West <br> <br><p></p><br>"Naomi Murakawa's indispensable, highly anticipated book convincingly challenges conventional wisdom about the origins of US 'law and order' society. Like other civil rights reforms, criminal justice policy was designed and successively expanded over the post-WWII decades by liberals invested in narrow, racially neutral processes and fair procedures, but largely indifferent to a world of broad, racially disparate outcomes. Protection from arbitrary violence - the liberal's first civil right - was the touchstone for a policy regime that continued to advance invidious associations of blackness and criminal behavior. Under this big tent, seemingly opposite racial politics converged to build the world's largest, most racially unequal, carceral state." <br> --Nikhil Pal Singh, New York University, author of <em>Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy</em> <br><p></p><br>"While most scholars agree that the roots of our current carceral state lay in law and order policies, Murakawa traces those policies to unlikely sources - the liberal Truman administration in its efforts to protect African Americans from mob and police violence. While the state did little to enforce such protections, it bequeathed our nation a criminal justice architecture that fueled mass incarceration. <em>The First Civil Right</em> not only overturns received wisdom, but reveals that 'racial liberalism' is not the solution but part of the problem." <br>--Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <em>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</em> <br><p></p><br>"Tackling one of the most important topics of our time, this sharply-argued, richly-researched, and tough-minded book exposes the roots of our carceral state. In highlighting ideology, liberal as well as conservative, as well as putatively neutral ideas and procedures, The First Civil Right compellingly marries policy analysis and studies of race to a penetrating account of officially-sanctioned racial cruelty." <br>--Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History, Columbia University <br><p></p><br>"With scrupulous attention to historical detail, Murakawa tracks the growth of the prison industrial complex" and "makes a powerful case...for viewing bipartisan solutions to present dilemmas with extreme skepticism." <br>-- James Kilgore, <em>Truthout</em><p></p><br>"[A]n incredibly important and long overdue challenge to the idea that law and order conservatives exclusively conspired to build a prison nation... [A]n unprecedented examination of how liberal racism undermines and appropriates movements for social justice." <br> -- Sara Benson, <em>Punishment &amp; Society</em><p></p><br>"The best scholarship explores compelling topics, offers provocative, often counterintuitive arguments, and does so in a timely manner. Typically, political science research fails on one or more counts. Not so with Naomi Murakawa's The First Civil Right, which explores the policy and political underpinnings of U.S. mass incarceration. Given Murakawa's exhaustive research, she clearly began researching the book years ago. Yet it could hardly have arrived at a more opportune time." <br>-- Jeffrey Smith, <em>Political Science Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"[A] big, important book on the carceral state that will be a touchstone for discussions of race, liberalism, and penal reform for years to come." <br>-- Marie Gottschalk, <em>Perspectives on Politics</em><p></p><br>"[A] remarkable investigation into the historical relationship between postwar liberalism and the growth of mass incarceration." <br>-- Mike Konczal, <em>Dissent</em><p></p><br>"The singularly ambitious contribution of <em>The First Civil Right</em> is that it meticulously documents the important role that the liberal 'law and order' ideology played in constructing the foundations on which the carceral state was built..L. Murakawa reminds us that liberals, too, were strategic actors in this period; in ignoring the political Left, we have missed 'liberal racial criminalization that thrived in the full light of day." <br>-- Amy Lerman and Vesla Weaver, <em>Perspectives on Politics</em> <br><p></p><br>"[A]n invaluable addition to the history of the carceral state... It is particularly in Murakawa's critique of death penalty abolition strategies that we see what the book ultimately argues for: a far more radical form of political will and activism than we have seen so far." <br>-- Yasmin Nair, <em>AlterNet</em><p></p><br>"The brilliant insight of Murakawa's book is to locate today's enforcement of white supremacy in the tools devised by liberals for 'solving' the problem of violent, extralegal racism... procedural fairness, race-neutral machinery, and formal equality." <br>-- Willie Osterweil, <em>The Nation</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Dreeben-Irimia&#x2019;s Introduction to Physical Therapy Practice for Physical Therapist Assistants</h2><p>Dreeben-Irimia&#39;s Introduction to Physical Therapy Practice for Physical Therapist Assistants, Fourth Edition introduces students to the role of the physical therapist assistant in physical therapy care.</p><p>Program Director, Lake Area Technical Institute</p><h2>Database Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Relational Database Design</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>The #1 Easy, Commonsense Guide to Database Design! </b>Michael J.

Lily Chalmers consulted the cheap timepiece pinned to the bodice of her blue calico dress and nodded to herself, satisfied that she wouldn't be late for work.<br><br>Lifting her skirts with one dainty hand, Lily picked her way carefully through the mud and horse dung that littered the street. A little smile curved her lips when she reached the other side and stepped onto the wooden sidewalk. The land office was open for business.<br><br>The clerk, a young man with spectacles and pockmarked skin, stood behind the counter. He touched the brim of his visor when Lily entered. His gaze moved from her pale blond hair, done up in a chignon at the back of her neck, to her wide brown eyes and small, slender figure. "Mornin'," he said, with what Lily suspected was unusual enthusiasm.<br><br>Although she had never liked being assessed in that particular way, she'd long since gotten used to it. Besides, nothing could take the glow off this perfect blue-and-gold day -- not even the fact that she had to be at the Harrison Hotel in half an hour to serve another meal to a lot of noisy soldiers.<br><br>"I'd like to stake a claim on a piece of land, please," Lily said proudly. She took a folded map from her ancient beaded bag and held it out.<br><br>The clerk's eyes shifted to a place just beyond Lily's left shoulder, then back to her face. "Your husband isn't with you?" he asked. He looked disappointed now, rather than fervent.<br><br>Lily sighed and straightened her shoulders. "I don't have a husband," she said clearly.<br><br>There was a twitch in the clerk's left cheek, and his small eyes widened -- behind their spectacles. "You don't have a husband?" he echoed. "But you can't -- you don't just -- "<br><br>Lily had prepared for his argument, incoherently presented though it was. "Under the law, any able-bodied person of legal age may stake a claim to one-half section of land," she said, praying no one would demand proof that she had reached her majority. In truth, she was not quite nineteen. "One has only to prove up on their three hundred and twenty acres within five years, by building a house and planting crops."<br><br>The clerk was now thrumming the fingers of both hands on the countertop. He was clearly agitated. He started to speak, but his words came out in such a garble that they were unintelligible. Lily reached out to pat one of his hands.<br><br>"Be calm, now," she said in a gentle but firm voice. "Just tell me your name, and we'll work this all out amicably."<br><br>"Monroe," he replied. "My name is Monroe Samuels."<br><br>She nodded, pleased, and extended one gloved hand. "And I'm Miss Lily Chalmers," she responded sweetly. "Now, if we could just get down to business -- I have another appointment very shortly."<br><br>Monroe took up the map Lily had laid on the countertop and unfolded it. His Adam's apple jogged up his throat, then down again as he scanned the rough drawing of the land Lily had selected. He looked at her helplessly for a moment, then went to a shelf and took down an enormous book, which he opened with a flourish.<br><br>Lily stood on tiptoe, trying to make out the words marching neatly across the pages in a slanted black scrawl, but she was too far away.<br><br>"There is a five-dollar filing fee," Monroe said after clearing his throat. He seemed to expect Lily to be daunted by this announcement.<br><br>Again she opened her drawstring-bag, this time taking out a five-dollar note. "I have it right here," she answered.<br><br>Monroe came and snatched up the map again, carrying it back to compare it with whatever was written in the book. "It might already be taken, you know."<br><br>Lily held her breath. Her land couldn't be taken -- it just couldn't. Right from the very beginning she'd known God meant it to be hers and hers alone. She closed her eyes for a moment, summoning up images of the silvery creek shining in the sun, of the deep green grass and gently flowing bottomland where she meant to plant her crops. She could almost smell the stand of pine and fir trees that lined the southern border of her claim.<br><br>Monroe cleared his throat again, glanced at Lily's money as if to make sure it hadn't vanished, and dipped a pen to make a grudging notation in the book. "You need a husband to homestead," he fussed. "You're going to be dealing with Indians, and rattlesnakes, and outlaws -- "<br><br>"We had all those things in Nebraska," Lily, broke in politely, consulting her watch again. "And I survived. Now, if you'd just hurry..."<br><br>Scowling, Monroe wrote up a receipt and a temporary deed. "The half-section next to yours is already claimed," he warned, "Just make sure you've got your property line straight."<br><br>Lily scowled back. "I paced it off myself," she said.<br><br>Monroe did not look reassured. He snatched up the five dollars and shoved the deed and receipt at Lily. "Good luck, Miss Chalmers. You'll need it."<br><br>If the ink had been dry, Lily would have pressed the temporary deed to her bosom in triumph. She smiled at the petulant clerk to let him know he hadn't managed to discourage her, and she hurried out.<br><br>A stiff breeze made the certificate crackle between her fingers as she stood on the sidewalk inspecting it. For the first time in her life Lily owned something solid and real. Once she'd built her house and put in her crops she would be completely independent; never again would she be the interloper, the unwelcome burden.<br><br>She pursed her lips and blew on the deed like a child bending over a birthday cake and, when she was sure the ink was dry, rolled it neatly and tied it with a piece of string from her purse.<br><br>Her step was brisk as she hurried toward the hotel, where a long day's work awaited her.<br><br>She entered through the back way, recoiling as a blast of heat from the kitchen stove struck her. Carefully, she put her handbag and the precious deed away on a pantry shelf.<br><br>"There's a lot of 'em today," barked Charlie Mayfield, the cook, as he shouldered his way through the swinging door that led to the dining room, "and they're fractious."<br><br>Lily reached for her checkered apron, tied the strings at the back of her neck and at her waist, and nodded. "They're always troublesome," she said with resignation. "They're soldiers."<br><br>For Lily, those last two words said it all. She had no use whatsoever for men in uniform. They were invariably obnoxious, with no consideration for other people's rights.<br><br>Lily smoothed her hair once and set to work.<br><br>Later, as she passed between the crowded tables, gripping an overloaded tray in both hands, one of the soldiers reached out and wrenched hard at her apron strings. Pulled off balance, she stumbled, and the tray clattered to the floor.<br><br>Infuriated, the joy of her temporary deed forgotten for the moment, Lily whirled on her tormenter, a young infantryman with a broad grin, picked up the mug of foaming beer in front of him, and flung the contents into his face. The other troopers whooped and cheered with delight.<br><br>A surge of heat moved up Lily's neck to throb in her cheeks and along the rims of her ears. Soldiers never seemed to care what trouble they caused, just as long as they had their good times.<br><br>She knelt and began gathering up the dirty cups, plates, and silverware she'd dropped with the tray.<br><br>The movements of her hands were quick and jerky, but she went still when she saw a pair of scuffed black boots come to a stop directly in front of her, and her temper swelled anew. These rascals had been harassing her with their exuberant mischief all morning, and she was through turning the other cheek.<br><br>She rose slowly to her feet and sighed as she felt the pins in her once-tidy hair give way, sending the silver-gold tresses tumbling down over her shoulders. Crows of amusement rose all around her as she set her hands on her hips and raised her chin.<br><br>The eyes that gazed down at her were just the color of maple sugar and shadowed by the brim of a dusty blue field hat banded in gold braid. A gloved hand reached up to remove the hat, revealing a thatch of golden-brown hair.<br><br>"On behalf of the United States Army, ma'am" a deep voice said with barely contained amusement, "I'd like to apologize for these men."<br><br>Lily reminded herself that the soldiers from nearby Fort Deveraux kept the hotel dining room in business, and that without them she wouldn't have a job. Nevertheless, she was near the end of her patience. "They would seem to be boys," she answered pointedly, "rather than men."<br><br>The barb brought a chorus of howls, whistles, and cries of mock despair.<br><br>The man looking down at Lily -- a major, judging by his insignia -- grinned rather insolently, showing teeth as white as the keys on a new piano. "They've been on patrol for two weeks, ma'am," he explained with elaborate cordiality, apparently choosing to ignore her comment on their collective bad manners.<br><br>Something about the curve of his lips made Lily feel as though the room had done a half spin. She reached out to steady herself by gripping the back of a chair. "I fail to see how that gives them the right to behave like circus gorillas."<br><br>The major's grin intensified, half blinding Lily. "Of course, you're right," he said. Every word that came out of his mouth was congenial. So why did she feel that he was making fun of her?<br><br>Lily found herself looking at the button-down panel on the front of his shirt and wondering about the chest beneath it. Was it as broad and muscled as it appeared, covered in a downy mass of maple hair?<br><br>With a toss of her head she shook off the unwelcome thought and knelt to finish gathering the crockery. She was surprised when the major squatted down to help, but she wouldn't meet his eyes.<br><br>"What's your name?" he asked.<br><br>Lily flung the last of the silverware onto the tray with a clatter. "It'll be mud if I don't get back to the kitchen and pick up my orders," she snapped.<br><br>The major took the heavy tray and stood with a sort of rolling grace while Lily scrambled inelegantly back to her feet. Just as she reached out to take the tray back someone pinched her hard on the bottom, and everything cascaded back to the floor again.<br><br>Lily cried out, spinning around in search of the culprit. "Who did that?" she demanded.<br><br>The unshaven, unwashed faces around her fairly glowed with innocence. It was obvious that no one was going to admit to the crime.<br><br>The major cleared his throat, and the troops, so rowdy only an instant before, immediately fell silent.<br><br>"That'll be enough," he said with quiet authority. "The next man who bedevils this woman will spend his leave time in the stockade. Is that understood?"<br><br>"Yes, sir," the men answered in rousing unison. One picked up Lily's tray and handed it to her, brimming with shattered plates and cups and dirty silverware.<br><br>She turned in a whirl of calico and stormed away, remembering the man who'd come into her mother's life years before and persuaded Kathleen to send Lily and her sisters west on the orphan train.<br><br>Soldiers. They were all alike.<br><br>In the cramped, sweltering kitchen she found Charlie in the expected state of annoyance. "These dinners are getting cold!" he complained, gesturing toward platefuls of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and creamed corn.<br><br>Hastily Lily smoothed back her hair and pinned it into a chignon for the second time that day. "I know," she said, and I'm sorry."<br><br>Charlie softened. He was an older man with thinning white hair and a crotchety manner, but he was basically kind. "I suppose the lads were pestering you a little. Serve them right if they had to eat their dinners cold," he said, but all the while he was filling clean plates from the pots and kettles on the stove.<br><br>Lily smiled at him and hurried out with the tray, keeping to the edge of the dining room in hopes of avoiding more trouble with the soldiers. But they were behaving themselves.<br><br>Reaching the table beside the corner window, Lily was taken aback to find the major there, along with an older man wearing the uniform of a colonel. An elegantly dressed woman with iron-gray hair and a sweet expression sat beside the ranking officer, and she smiled as Lily set a plate before her.<br><br>"You're new in Tylerville, aren't you?" the lady asked.<br><br>Lily bit her lower lip and nodded. She had no time to chat, but she didn't want to offend a customer. "Yes, ma'am," she answered. "I've been here a month."<br><br>The woman extended a gloved hand. "Welcome," she said. "My name is Gertrude Tibbet."<br><br>Lily glanced at the major, who was watching her with a look of humorous interest in his eyes, and swallowed. "I'm Lily," she replied. "Lily Chalmers."<br><br>This is Major Caleb Halliday, an old friend of ours," Mrs. Tibbet went on cheerfully, indicating the man with the bold smile, "and beside me is my husband, Colonel John Tibbet."<br><br>Lily nodded politely at the colonel, a stout man with snow-white hair and a mustache to match. She ignored the major. Neither man stood, as they might have done under other circumstances.<br><br>"Let the poor girl get on with her work, Gertrude," Colonel Tibbet protested, chewing.<br><br>At that Mrs. Tibbet fell silent, and Lily turned and hurried away. She spent the rest of the day scurrying breathlessly from one table to another, filling coffee cups, carrying food, taking away dirty plates and silverware.<br><br>By the time the dining room closed hours later Lily's feet were throbbing, and she was so tired she could barely see. She spent another hour washing and drying dishes, then stumbled back to the storeroom beside the kitchen to fetch her bonnet and cloak. When she stepped out into the cool spring evening Major Halliday was waiting for her.<br><br>He tilted his hat. "Evening, Miss Chalmers," he said.<br><br>Lily glowered at him. "What do you want?"<br><br>The major smiled that insolent, melting smile of his. He had bathed, Lily noticed, and his uniform was fresh. He hesitated for a moment, then said, "I'd like to walk you home. It's dark, after all, and a town full of soldiers is no place for a woman alone."<br><br>Lily squared her slender shoulders. "My rooming house is nearby," she said in dismissal. "So I don't need an escort, thank you."<br><br>It was as though she hadn't spoken. Major Halliday fell into step beside her, settling his hat on his head with a practiced motion of one hand. "Where did you live before you came here?" he asked.<br><br>Lily sighed. The man was over six feet tall, and he probably weighed twice what she did. There would be no getting rid of him if he didn't want to go. "Nebraska," she replied, quickening her pace.<br><br>The major frowned. "That's a long way off. Do you have family in Tylerville?"<br><br>An old grief sounded inside Lily like a far-off bell as she thought of her lost sisters. Maybe, despite all her prayers and her letter-writing and her traveling from place to place, she'd never find them. She shook her head. "No family."<br><br>"Anywhere?" the major pressed.<br><br>Lily glanced at him. "I have an adopted brother living in Spokane," she answered. She wouldn't tell him about Emma and Caroline; that would be like baring a freshly bandaged wound. "Why are you so curious about me, Major?"<br><br>He smiled. "My name is Caleb," he corrected, ignoring her question.<br><br>"That's more than I care to know," Lily replied haughtily, and he laughed at that.<br><br>"I suppose it is. May I call you Lily?"<br><br>"No, you may not. I'm to be 'Miss Chalmers,' if y...</p><h2>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself, with &#x201c;A True Tale of Slavery&#x201d; by John S. Jacobs (The John Harvard Library)</h2><p>This enlarged edition of the most significant and celebrated slave narrative completes the Jacobs family saga, surely one of the most memorable in all of American history. <b>John S. Jacobs</b>&#x2019;s short slave narrative, <i>A True Tale of Slavery</i>, published in London in 1861, adds a brother&#x2019;s perspective to <b>Harriet A. Jacobs</b>&#x2019;s autobiography. It is an exciting addition to this now classic work, as John Jacobs presents further historical information about family life so well described already by his sister. Once more, <b>Jean Fagan Yellin</b>, who discovered this long-lost document, supplies annotation and authentication.<br>This is the standard edition of <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, reissued here in the John Harvard Library and updated with a new bibliography.</p><p>These two slave narratives expand our knowledge of the differing ways males and females coped with enslavement and later ordeals in flight. This popularly-priced anthology contains the often taught Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs and the recently discovered A True Tale of Slavery by John S.

Jacobs &#x201c;walked away&#x201d; as he put it, from his owner, a congressman. He sailed on a whaling ship and educated himself. He then became a paid agent of the Anti-Slavery Society, made a lecturing trip with Frederick Douglass, and finally settled in London, where he remained until it was safe for a fugitive to return to the North. He wrote his story for a London Sunday school journal where it was published in 1861.</p>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition combines the two most important African American slave narratives into one volume. <br>Frederick Douglass's Narrative, first published in 1845, is an enlightening and incendiary text. Born into slavery, Douglass became the preeminent spokesman for his people during his life; his narrative is an unparalleled account of the dehumanizing effects of slavery and Douglass's own triumph over it. Like Douglass, Harriet Jacobs was born into slavery, and in 1861 she published Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, now recognized as the most comprehensive antebellum slave narrative written by a woman. Jacobs's account broke the silence on the exploitation of African American female slaves, and it remains crucial reading. These narratives illuminate and inform each other. This edition includes an incisive Introduction by Kwame Anthony Appiah and extensive annotations. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>Down the Nile: Alone in a Fisherman&#39;s Skiff</h2><p>When Rosemary Mahoney, in 1998, took a solo trip down the Nile in a seven-foot rowboat, she discovered modern Egypt for herself. As a rower, she faced crocodiles and testy river currents; as a female, she confronted deeply-held beliefs about foreign women while cautiously remaining open to genuine friendship; and, as a traveler, she experienced events that ranged from the humorous to the hair-raising--including an encounter that began as one of the most frightening of her life and ended as an edifying and chastening lesson in human nature and cultural misunderstanding. Whether she's meeting Nubians and Egyptians, or finding connections to Westerners who traveled up the Nile in earlier times--Florence Nightingale and Gustave Flaubert among them--Mahoney's informed curiosity about the world never ceases to captivate the reader.<br> "A pilgrimage about pilgrims and holy places that is not only enlightening but also very funny." -Paul Theroux (on <em>The Singular Pilgrim</em>)<br> "Mahoney is a wonderfully effective catalytic agent: she goes to Ireland and just makes the country happen around her." -Jonathan Raban (on <em>Whoredom in Kimmage</em>)<br><br>"Mahoney, who has been rowing for 10 year, brilliantly juxtaposes an account of her own palm-blistering hours on the Nile....with the diary entries of two Victorian travelers-Gustave Flaubert and Florence Nightingale."<br> --Lisa Fugard, <em>New York</em><em> Times Book Review</em></p><p>Rosemary Mahoney is the author of <em>The Early Arrival of Dreams</em>, a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book; <em>Whoredom in Kimmage</em>, a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist; <em>A Likely Story: One Summer with Lillian Hellman</em>; <em>The Singular Pilgrim: Travels on Sacred Ground; </em>and <em>Down the Nile: Alone in a Fisherman's Skiff, </em>a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book. She is the recipient of a Whiting Writer's Award.<i>Starred Review.</i> This is travel writing at its most enjoyable: the reader is taken on a great trip with an erudite travel companion soaking up scads of history, culture and literary knowledge, along with the scenery. The genesis for the trip is simple: the author's love of rowing. Her plan, "to buy a small Egyptian rowboat and row myself along the 120-mile stretch of river between the cities of Aswan and Qena," is less so. Mahoney (<i>The Singular Pilgrim</i>; <i>Whoredom in Kimmage</i>) conveys readers along the longest river in the world, through narrative laced with insight, goodwill and sometimes sadness. Mahoney's writing style is conversational, her use of metaphor adept. She cleverly marshals the writings of numerous river travelers but focuses on "two troubled geniuses": Florence Nightingale and Gustave Flaubert. The device allows readers a backward glance at the Edwardian travel accoutrements of sumptuous riverside dinners, staggering supplies of alcohol and food, trunks of books and commodious accommodations. The physical environment is demanding. "When I removed my hat, the sun had made the top of my head sting... it was like having a freshly baked nail driven into one's skull." Yet her biggest obstacle isn't the climate but the slippery hurdles of culture and sex. Whether struggling to buy a boat, visiting historic Luxor or rowing, innocent encounters become sticky psychological and philosophical snares. Still, the ride is smooth, leaving the reader wishing for more nautical miles. <i>(July 11)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now nine leading scholars of postwar America offer a revealing look at the Seventies and their rightful place in the epic narrative of American history <br><br>This is the first major work to relate the economic decline and cultural despair of the Seventies to the creative efforts that would reshape American society. Dogged by economic and political crises at home and foreign policy failures abroad, Americans responded to a growing sense of uncertainty in a variety of ways. Some explored the new freedoms promised by the social change movements of the late Sixties. Some challenged the technological verities that ruled corporate America. Others sought to create autonomous zones in the ruins of decaying cities or on the bleak landscape of anomic suburbia. And, against a backdrop of massive economic dislocation and bicentennial celebrations, many Americans struggled to redefine patriotism and the meaning of the American dream.<br><br>Focusing on how Americans made sense of their changing world by analyzing such sources as film, popular music, use of public space, advertising campaigns, and patriot rituals, these essays interweave the themes of economic transformation, identity reconfiguration, and cultural uncertainty. The contributors cover such topics as the publics increasing mistrust of government, the reshaping of working-class identity, and the tensions between the ideological and economic origins of changing gender roles.<br><br>From existential despair in popular culture to the reactions of youth subcultures, these provocative articles plot the lives of Americans struggling to redefine themselves as their nation moved into an uncertain future.

He looks at the issue of child abuse--very much a reality, though the idea of child abuse is a social product. He also cautiously examines the ways in which advanced research on new weapons influences not the content but the form of science. In conclusion, Hacking comments on the "culture wars" in anthropology, in particular a spat between leading ethnographers over Hawaii and Captain Cook.

Haddix has masterfully melded in-depth information about the history of immigration, the struggle for women's rights, the beginnings of the organized labor movement, and the horrific Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 within a narrative that will simultaneously engross and educate its readers. The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Bella, an Italian immigrant teen; Yetta, a Russian Jewish immigrant; and Jane, the daughter of an upper-class American businessman. Yetta is opinionated and aware of how immigrants, especially women, are mistreated. She is outspoken and ready to work toward improving conditions. Bella is a new immigrant and easily taken advantage of. She only wants to earn money to send home so the rest of her family can join her in America. Though wealthy, Jane is influenced by college girls who are starting to work for women's rights. The three girls meet during the strike at the Triangle factory. Jane bravely leaves home when she learns that her father was involved in trying to break the strike.

The development of our understanding of the strength of materials has enabled engineers to establish the forces which can safely be imposed on structure or components, or to choose materials appropriate to the necessary dimensions of structures and components which have to withstand given loads without suffering effects deleterious to their proper functioning.<br>This excellent historical survey of the strength of materials with many references to the theories of elasticity and structures is based on an extensive series of lectures delivered by the author at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. Timoshenko explores the early roots of the discipline from the great monuments and pyramids of ancient Egypt through the temples, roads, and fortifications of ancient Greece and Rome. The author fixes the formal beginning of the modern science of the strength of materials with the publications of Galileo's book, "Two Sciences," and traces the rise and development as well as industrial and commercial applications of the fledgling science from the seventeenth century through the twentieth century. <br>Timoshenko fleshes out the bare bones of mathematical theory with lucid demonstrations of important equations and brief biographies of highly influential mathematicians, including: Euler, Lagrange, Navier, Thomas Young, Saint-Venant, Franz Neumann, Maxwell, Kelvin, Rayleigh, Klein, Prandtl, and many others. These theories, equations, and biographies are further enhanced by clear discussions of the development of engineering and engineering education in Italy, France, Germany, England, and elsewhere. 245 figures.</p><p>The father of modern engineering mechanics, Stephen Timoshenko (1868&#x2013;1972) taught for decades at Stanford University.

Yet while heat from sunlight and ventilation from breezes is free for the taking, few modern architects or builders really understand the principles involved.</p> <p>Now Dan Chiras, author of the popular book <em>The Natural House,</em> brings those principles up to date for a new generation of solar enthusiasts.</p> <p>The techniques required to heat and cool a building passively have been used for thousands of years. Early societies such as the Native American Anasazis and the ancient Greeks perfected designs that effectively exploited these natural processes. The Greeks considered anyone who didn't use passive solar to heat a home to be a barbarian!</p> <p>In the United States, passive solar architecture experienced a major resurgence of interest in the 1970s in response to crippling oil embargoes. With grand enthusiasm but with scant knowledge (and sometimes little common sense), architects and builders created a wide variety of solar homes. Some worked pretty well, but looked more like laboratories than houses. Others performed poorly, overheating in the summer because of excessive or misplaced windows and skylights, and growing chilly in the colder months because of insufficient thermal mass and insulation and poor siting.</p> <p>In <em>The Solar House,</em> Dan Chiras sets the record straight on the vast potential for passive heating and cooling. Acknowledging the good intentions of misguided solar designers in the past, he highlights certain egregious&#x2014;and entirely avoidable&#x2014;errors. More importantly, Chiras explains in methodical detail how today's home builders can succeed with solar designs.</p> <p>Now that energy efficiency measures including higher levels of insulation and multi-layered glazing have become standard, it is easier than ever before to create a comfortable and affordable passive solar house that will provide year-round comfort in any climate.</p> <p>Moreover, since modern building materials and airtight construction methods sometimes result in air-quality and even toxicity problems, Chiras explains state-of-the-art ventilation and filtering techniques that complement the ancient solar strategies of thermal mass and daylighting. Chiras also explains the new diagnostic aids available in printed worksheet or software formats, allowing readers to generate their own design schemes.</p></p><p><p>Dan Chiras paid his last electric bill in June of 1996. It is not that he has disavowed the use of electricity and modern conveniences, but rather that he has turned to the sun and wind to meet his family's needs.<br><br> In 1995, Dan, a former full-time college professor with years of experience in sustainable development, built a state-of-the-art rammed earth tire and straw bale home in Evergreen, Colorado. He installed solar electric panels on the roof; a year or so later he installed a small wind generator. Since that time, he has met nearly all of his electrical needs for his home and office from these clean, renewable sources.<br><br> Dan also heats his home in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains 8000-feet above sea level with energy from the sun thanks to passive solar design. For backup heat on those cold winter nights, he burns a cord of wood a year, gathered free from his community. His annual gas bill, mostly for showers and cooking, runs about $120 a year - about $2 to $3 per month for natural gas and $10 per month to read the meter!<br><br> Dan has spent much of the past 30 years studying sustainability and applying what he has learned in solar energy, natural building, and green building to his residences, and most of the last ten years sharing the practical knowledge he has gained through writing, lectures, slide shows, and workshops.<br><br> Dan has published 21 books to date including several college and high school textbooks: <em>Environmental Science: Creating a Sustainable Future, Natural Resource Conservation, Human Biology</em>, and <em>Biology: The Web of Life</em>. His high school environmental science text, <em>Environmental Science</em>, was selected as the official book of the U.S. Academic Decathlon's 1991 competition.<br><br> In the early 1990s, Dan published two trade books on environmental issues and sustainability for a general audience: <em>Beyond the Fray: Reshaping America's Response</em> and <em>Lessons from Nature: Learning to Live Sustainably on the Earth</em>.<br><br> Since 1995, Dan has focused most of his attention on residential green building. He has written extensively on the subject. His is books include: <em>The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy Efficient, Environmental Homes; The Natural Plaster Book; The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling; Superbia! 31 Ways to Create Sustainable Suburbs</em>; and <em>The New Ecological Home</em>.<br><br> His newest book, <em>EcoKids: Raising Kids Who Care for the Earth</em> will be published in the Spring of 2005 by New Society Publishers.<br><br> Dan also writes extensively for magazines, journals, newsletters, and newspapers. He has published nearly 250 articles on environmental issues, sustainability, natural building, natural plaster, green building, and passive solar heating and cooling. His articles appear regularly in <em>Home Power, Mother Earth News, Natural Home</em>, and <em>The Last Straw</em>.<br><br> Dan also writes frequently for <em>World Book Encyclopedia</em> (Science Year) and <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>. He authored a 12-page article on the environment for <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>. Dan has written environmental pollution section for <em>World Book Encyclopedia's</em> annual publication, <em>Science Year</em>, since 1993. In 1997, he wrote an extensive piece for <em>World Book</em> on population growth and its many implications. Dan also wrote the ecology and air pollution sections for <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>.<br><br> In addition to his writing, Dan has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado in Denver and the University of Colorado at Denver. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Washington, where he taught a course on environmental science. He currently is a Melon Visiting Professor at Colorado College where he teaches courses on renewable energy, ecological design, and sustainable development.<br><br> Through his writing and teaching in the 1980s and early 1990s, Dan played a leading role in promoting critical thinking, an understanding of the root causes of environmental issues, systemic solutions to environmental problems, sustainable development. He pioneered a systems approach to sustainable development and has played a lead role in articulating the principles, policies, and practices of sustainable development which seeks ways that business and society can prosper within a healthy environment. He is currently focusing most of his research and writing on sustainable building and sustainable communities.<br><br> Dan's free time is spent mountain biking, canoeing, playing music, and gardening. <br><br> For more information visit danchiras.com.</p><p>"An excellent guide for embracing ecologically-friendly living."--<strong><em>Midwest Book Review</em></strong></p></p><h2>On Blue&#39;s Waters: Volume One of &#39;The Book of the Short Sun&#39; (Book of the Short Sun, 1)</h2><p><p><b><i>On Blue's Waters </i>is the start of a major new work by Gene Wolfe, the first of three volumes that comprise The Book of the Short Sun, which takes place in the years after Wolfe's four-volume Book of the Long Sun. </b></p><p>Horn, the narrator of the earlier work, now tells his own story.

It is nothing. You might go around the market all day and never find a single spirit who would trade you a fresh egg for it. Yet it holds...<br>Enough.<br>Yes, enough. I am sick of fancies.<br>* * *<br>At present it holds two quills, for I have taken the third one out. Two were in it when I found it in the ashes of our shop. The third, with which I am writing, was dropped by Oreb not so long ago. I picked it up, put it in this pen case, and forgot both Oreb and his feather.<br>It also holds a knife for pointing pens and the small bottle of black ink (more than half full) into which I dip mine. See how much darker my writing has become.<br>* * *<br>It is facts I need--facts I starve for. To Green with fancies!<br>My name is Horn.<br>This is such a pen case as students use in Viron, the city in which I was born, and no doubt in many others--a case of black leather glued over pressboard; it has a brass hinge with a steel spring, and a little brass clamp to keep it shut. We sold them in our shop and asked six cardbits; but my father would accept four if the purchaser bargained awhile, and such purchasers always did.<br>Three, if they bought something else, a quire of writing paper, say.<br>* * *<br>The leather is badly scuffed. More facts later, when I have more time. Rajya Mantri wants to lecture me.<br>* * *<br>Reviewing what I wrote yesterday, I see that I have begun without plan or foresight, and in fact without the least notion of what I was trying to do or why I was trying to do it. That is how I have begun everything in life. Perhaps I need to begin before I can think clearly about the task. The chief thing is to begin, after all--after which the chief thing is to finish. I have finished worse than I began, for the most part.<br>It is all in the pen case. You have to take out the ink and string it together into the right shapes. That is all.<br>* * *<br>If I had not picked up this old pen case where my father's shop once stood, it is possible that I might still be searching for Silk. <br>For the phantom who has eluded me on three whorls.<br>* * *<br>Silk may be here on Blue already, after all. I have dispatched letters to Han and some other towns, and we will see. It is convenient, I find, to have messengers at one's beck and call.<br>So I am searching here, although I am the only person here in Gaon who could not tell you where to find him. Searching does not necessarily imply movement. Thinking it does, or rather assuming it without thought, may have been my first and worst mistake.<br>Thus I continue to search, true to my oath. I question travelers, and I write new letters subtracting some facts and adding others, composing flatteries and threats I hope will bring this town and that to my assistance; no doubt my scribe thinks I am penning another such letter at this moment, a letter that he, poor fellow, will have to copy out with broad, fair flourishes upon sheepskins scraped thin.<br>We need a paper mill here, and it is the only thing that I am competent to do.<br>* * *<br>I wish Oreb were here.<br>* * *<br>Now that I know what I mean to do, I can begin. But not at the beginning. To begin at the beginning would consume far too much time and paper, to say nothing of ink. I am going to begin, when I do, just a day or two before the moment at which I put to sea in the sloop.<br>Tomorrow then, when I have had time to decide how best to tell the convoluted tale of my long, vain search for Patera Silk--for Silk my ideal, who was the augur of our manteion in the Sun Street Quarter of Our Sacred City of Viron in the belly of the <i>Whorl</i>.<br>When I was young.<br>* * *<br>The mainshaft had split--I remember that. I was taking it out of the journals when one of the twins ran in. I believe it was Hide. "A boat's coming! A big boat's coming!"<br>I told him that they probably wanted to buy a few bales, and that his mother could sell it to them as well as I could.<br>"Sinew's here, too."<br>Just to get rid of Hide, I told him to tell his mother about it. When he had gone, I got my needler from its hiding place and stuck it in my waistband under my greasy tunic.<br>Sinew was stamping up and down the beach, lovely shells of purple, rose, and purest white snapping beneath his boots. He looked surly when he saw me, so I told him to bring the good telescope out of the sloop. He would have defied me if he had possessed the courage. For half a minute we stood eye to eye; then he turned and went. I thought he was leaving, that he would put out for the mainland in his coracle and stay there for a week or a month, which to tell the truth I wanted much more than my telescope.<br>The boat they came in was indeed large. I know I counted at least a dozen sails. It carried a couple of jibs, three sails on each of its big masts, and staysails. I had never seen a boat big enough to set staysails between its masts before, so I am sure of those.<br>Sinew came back with the telescope. I asked whether he wanted the first look, and he sneered at me. It was always a mistake to try to treat him with any courtesy in those days, and I could have kicked myself for it. I put the telescope to my eye, wondering what Sinew was doing the second I could no longer watch him.<br>It was a good instrument, made in Dorp they said, where they are good sailors and grind good lenses. (We were good sailors in New Viron, too--or thought we were--but did not grind lenses at all.) Through it I could see the faces at the gunwale, all looking toward Tail Bay, for which their boat was plainly making. Its hull was white above and black below--I recall that, too. Here on Blue the sea is silver where it is not so dark a blue that it seems it might dye cloth, not at all like Lake Limna at home where the waves were nearly always green.<br>I had become used to Blue's blue and silver sea long ago, of course. Perhaps I only think of it now because we are so far from it here in Gaon; but it seems to me, as I sit here to write at this beautifully inlaid table the Gaonese have provided for me, that I saw it then through the glass as though it were new, that there was some magic carried in the big black and white boat that made Blue new to me again. Perhaps there was, for boats are magic--living things that ordinary men like me can shape from wood and iron.<br>"Probably pirates," Sinew snarled.<br>I took my eye from the telescope and saw that he had his long, steel-hilted hunting knife out and was testing its edge with his thumb. Sinew could never sharpen a knife properly (Nettle did it for him in those days), although he pretended he could; but for a moment before I returned to my study of the boat, I wondered whether he would not stab me and try to join them if pirates in fact came again. Then I put my eye back to the telescope, and saw that the faces at the gunwale included a woman's, and that one of the men was old Patera Remora. I should make it clear here that he and Marrow were the only ones I knew well.<br>There were five besides Gyrfalcon's sailors, who had been brought along to work the boat. Perhaps I ought to list all five now and describe them, since Nettle may want to show this to others. You would do everything much better, darling, I know, working in the descriptions cleverly as you did when we wrote <i>The Book of Silk</i>; but it is a skill I have never possessed to the same degree.<br>No doubt you remember them better than I, as well.<br>* * *<br>Gyrfalcon is fat, with busy eyes, a noble face, and a mop of sinknut-brown hair just starting to turn gray. It was his boat, and he let us know that the moment that he came ashore. Do you remember?<br>* * *<br>Eschar is tall and stooped, with a long, sad face, slow to speak until his passions are roused. He was on our lander, of course, just as Marrow and Remora were.<br>* * *<br>The woman came later, perhaps on Gyrfalcon's lander. Her name is Blazingstar. She has humor, as you do, a rare thing in a woman. I know you liked her, and so did I. She talked about her farms, so she must own at least two in addition to her trading company.<br>* * *<br>Marrow is large and solid, not so fat as he was at home, but balder even than I was then. When we were children, he owned a greengrocery as well as his fruit stall in the market. He still deals in vegetables and fruits mostly, I believe. I have never known him to cheat anyone, and he can be generous; but I would like to meet the man who can best him in a bargain. Marrow was the only one of the five who helped me after I was robbed in New Viron.<br>* * *<br>His Cognizance Patera Remora is of course the head of the Vironese Faith--quite tall but not muscular, with lank gray hair he wears too long. He was at one time coadjutor in Old Viron (as we say it here). A good and a kind man, not as shrewd as he believes, prone to be too careful.<br>* * *<br>They were too many for our little house. Hoof and Hide and I made a rude table on the beach, laying planks across boxes and barrels and bales of paper. Sinew carried out all the chairs, I brought the high and low stools I use in the mill, and you spread the planks with cloths and set what little cheer we had before our uninvited guests. And so we managed to entertain all five, and even Gyrfalcon's sailors, with some show of decency.<br>Marrow rapped the makeshift table, calling us to order. Our sons and the sailors were sitting on the beach, nudging one another, whispering, and tossing shells and pebbles into the silver waves. I would have sent them all away if I could. It did not seem to be my place to do so, and Marrow let them stay.<br>"First let me thank you both for your hospitality," he began. "You owe us no favors, since we have come to ask you for a big one--"<br>Gyrfalcon interrupted, saying, "To grant you a privilege." From the way he spoke, I felt sure that they had argued about this already.<br>Marrow shrugged. "I should have begun by explaining who we are. You know our names now, and even though you live so far from town, it's likely that you also know we're its five richest citizens."<br>Remora cleared his throat. "Not, um, so. No--ah--intent to, um, contradict, but not, er, I."<br>"Your Chapter's got more gelt than any of us," Eschar remarked dryly.<br>"Not mine, hey? Custodian--um-solely." The sweet salt wind ruffled his hair, making him look at once foolish and blessed.<br>Blazingstar spoke first to you, Nettle; then to me. "We are the five people who have jockeyed most successfully for money and power, that's all. We wanted them, we five, and we got them. Now here we are, begging you two to keep us from cutting our own throats."<br>"Not, um--"<br>"He'll deny it," she told us, "but it's the gods' own truth just the same. Our money belongs to us, mine to me, Gyrfalcon's to him, and so on. Patera here is going to insist that his isn't really his, that it belongs to the Chapter and he only takes care of it."<br>"Brava! Quite--um--ah...Precisely the case."<br>"But he's got it, and as Eschar said he's probably got more than any of us. He's got bravos, too, buckos to break heads for him whenever he wants."<br>Stubbornly, Remora shook his own. "There are many men of--ah--high heart amongst the faithful. That I, um, concede. However, we--ah--none--"<br>"He doesn't have to pay his," Blazingstar explained. "We pay ours."<br>Eschar asked Remora, "If it isn't so, what are you doing here?"<br>Marrow rapped the table again. "That's who we are. Do you understand now?"<br>You looked at me then, Nettle darling, inviting me to speak; but all I could think of to say was. "I don't think so."<br>Marrow said, "You don't know why we're here, naturally. We haven't told you. That will come soon enough."<br>Gyrfalcon snapped, "New Viron needs a cald�. Anybody can see it."<br>You nodded then, Nettle darling. "It's become a terrible place."<br>"Exactly. We came here to escape the Sun Street Quarter, didn't we? The Sun Street Quarter and the Orilla." Gyrfalcon chuckled. "But we carried them with us."<br>&nbsp;"It isn't just crime," Blazingstar declared, "though there's much too much of that. The wells are polluted and there's filth everywhere."<br>&nbsp;Gyrfalcon chuckled again. "Just like home."<br>"Worse. Filth and flies. Rats. It isn't just that the people want a cald�, though they do. <i>We</i> do. We're businesspeople at base, all of us. Traders and merchants. Sharpers, if you like."<br>"I must--ah," Remora began.<br>"All right, all except His Cognizance, who never hedges the truth even a finger's width. Or so he says." Blazingstar gave Remora a scornful smile. "But the rest of us need to carry on our businesses, and it's become almost impossible to do that in New Viron."<br>Marrow added, "And getting worse."<br>"Getting worse. Exactly."<br>You asked, "Can't one of you be cald�?"<br>Gyrfalcon laughed aloud at that; he has a good, booming laugh. "Suppose one of us became cald� tomorrow. How about old Marrow there? He wants it."<br>"I feel sure it would be a wonderful improvement."<br>Marrow thanked you. "For you and your family it would be, Nettle. What do think it would be for them?" He glanced around at Gyrfalcon, Remora, Eschar, and Blazingstar.<br>"An improvement, too, I think."<br>"Not a bit of it." Marrow had rapped the table before; now he struck it with his fist, rattling our mugs and plates. "I would take everything I could get. I would do my best to ruin them, and if you ask me I would succeed." He smiled, and glanced around at the woman and the three men I had believed were his friends. "They know it well, my dear. And, Nettle, they would do the same to me."<br>Eschar told you, "We need Cald� Silk here. I was the first to suggest it."<br>"He's still in the <i>Whorl</i>, isn't he? And...I don't like to say this."<br>"Then I will." Blazingstar reached across the table we had made to cover your hand with her own. "He may be dead. I left sixteen years ago, and by this time it's certainly possible."<br>"Hem!" Remora cleared his throat. "Theocracy, hey? I have suggested it, but they will, er, won't. Not if--ah--me. But, um, Patera Silk, eh? Yes. Yes, to that. Third party. Still an augur, eh? Indelible--ah--consecration. So, um. Modified? A mitigated theocracy. We, um, two in concert. I concur."<br>Gryfalcon summed up, "It's that or we fight, and a fight would destroy the town, and all of us, too, in all probability. Show them the letter, Marrow."<br>* * *<br>Hari Mau and I have formalized the court. Up until now, it seems, litigants have simply done whatever they could to come before the rajan (as their ruler was called at home) and made their cases. Witnesses were or were not called, and so forth. We have set up a system--tentative, of course, but it <i>is</i> a system--in a situation in which any system at all will surely be an improvement. Unless they choose otherwise, Nauvan will represent all the plaintiffs, and Somvar all the defendants. It will be their duty to see that evidence, witnesses, and so forth are present when I hear the case. In criminal cases, I will assign one or the other to prosecute, depending.<br>I feel like Vulpes.<br>They will have to be paid, of course; but demanding fees from both parties should encourage them to come to agreement, so that may work out well. Besides, there will be fines. I wish I knew more about our Vironese law--these people don't seem to have had any.<br>Back to it.<br>* * *<br>I swore an oath, adm...</p><h2>Basic Clinical Lab Competencies for Respiratory Care: An Integrated Approach</h2><p>A long time favorite, the fifth edition of BASIC CLINICAL LAB COMPETENCIES FOR RESPIRATORY CARE: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH continues to bring classroom theory to life at the bedside.

These are stories of transcendence and spiraling grief, of hallucinations and glories, of getting lost and found and lost again. The insights and careening energy in <i>Jesus' Son</i> have earned the book a place of its own among the classics of twentieth-century American literature.<b></b><br><b></b><br><b>For more than twenty years, Picador has been producing beautifully packaged literary fiction and nonfiction books from Manhattan's Flatiron Building. Our Twentieth Anniversary Modern Classics line pairs iconic books - <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> by Jeffrey Eugenides, <i>Steppenwolf</i> by Herman Hesse, <i>Jesus' Son</i> by Denis Johnson, and <i>Housekeeping</i> by Marilynne Robinson - with a design that's both small enough to fit in your pocket and unique enough to stand out on your bookshelf.</b><br><b></b></p></p><p>The unnamed narrator in <i>Jesus' Son</i> lives through a car wreck and a heroin overdose. Is he blessed? He cheats, lies, steals--but possesses a child's (or a mystic's) uncanny way of expressing the bare essence of things around him. In its own strange and luminous way, this linked collection of short fiction does the same. The stories follow characters who are seemingly marginalized beyond hope, drifting through a narcotic haze of ennui, failed relationships, and petty crime. In "Dundun" the narrator decides to take a shooting victim to the hospital, though not for the usual reasons: "I wanted to be the one who saw it through and got McInnes to the doctor without a wreck. People would talk about it, and I hoped I would be liked." Later he takes his own pathetic stab at violence in "The Other Man," attempting to avenge a drug rip-off but succeeding only at terrorizing an innocent family. Each meandering story--some utterly lacking in the usual elements of plot, including a beginning and an end--nonetheless demands compulsive reading, with Denis Johnson's first calling as a poet apparent in the off-kilter beauty of his prose. Open to any page and gems spill forth: "I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened. I knew a certain Oldsmobile would stop for me even before it slowed, and by the sweet voices of the family inside that we'd have an accident in the storm." <p> The most successful stories in the collection offer moments of startling clarity. In "Car Crash While Hitchhiking," for instance, the narrator feels most alive while in the presence of another's loss: "Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn't know yet that her husband was dead.... What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I've gone looking for that feeling everywhere." In "Work," while "salvaging" copper wire from a flooded house to fund their habits, the narrator and an acquaintance stop to watch the nearly unfathomable sight of a beautiful, naked woman paragliding up the river. Later the narrator learns that the house once belonged to his down-and-out accomplice and that the woman is his estranged wife. "As nearly as I could tell, I'd wandered into some sort of dream that Wayne was having about his wife, and his house," he reasons. Such is the experience for the reader. More Genet than Bukowski, Denis Johnson lures us into a misfit soul's dream from which he can't awake. <i>--Langdon Cook</i></p><b>Denis Johnson (1949-2017)</b> is the author of eight novels, one novella, one book of short stories, three collections of poetry, two collections of plays, and one book of reportage.

He lives in Bournemouth, England, with his wife and son.1<br><br>Forty-�Four Years Later<br><br>Nina Wilde gazed in wonderment at the ruins of Atlantis rolling past beneath the submersible. Ten years had passed since she&#x2019;d discovered the lost civilization, using the lifelong work of her parents, Henry and Laura Wilde, as the foundations of her own research. The intervening decade had seen others join the task of excavating the wonders lost for eleven millennia, what had once been a rolling expanse of silt eight hundred feet beneath the Atlantic now dotted with buildings, many still surprisingly intact despite the earthquake and deluge that had dropped an entire island below the waves. It was an incredible sight.<br><br>But to her frustration, she wasn&#x2019;t seeing it in person.<br><br>The submersible was relaying the images picked out by its spotlights and laser scanners up an umbilical cable to a research vessel above, which in turn was transmitting them to an operations center in the offices of the International Heritage Agency at the United Nations in New York. As much as Nina desperately wanted to revisit the site, she had&#x2014;�with deep reluctance&#x2014;�settled for watching the expedition unfold on a screen several thousand miles away. Adding to her annoyance, her husband was aboard the submersible . . . despite not especially wanting to be there.<br><br>&#x201c;Wish you&#x2019;d kept up your dive certification,&#x201d; said Eddie Chase over the comm system, his deep voice with its broad Yorkshire accent reverberating inside his spherical acrylic helmet. &#x201c;Then you could be freezing your bum off down here while I sit around drinking coffee in a nice comfy chair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You remember what the IHA&#x2019;s office chairs are like, right?&#x201d; Nina replied, a little tersely. &#x201c;And, y&#x2019;know, having a baby kind of affected our priorities. You missed those new Star Wars movies; I didn&#x2019;t qualify to use a new version of a deep submergence suit. Not that I needed some certificate when I was running the IHA,&#x201d; she added, with a glance at the man beside her. &#x201c;I just learned how to use the thing, then used it.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Lester Blumberg peered over his horn-�rimmed glasses with a patronizing smile. &#x201c;Yes, but we&#x2019;re a lot less&#x2014;�how shall I put it?&#x2014;�improvisational now than when you were in charge, Nina. Everyone needs proper training and certification for any IHA operation. Health and safety, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know.&#x201d; Nina&#x2019;s own smile was decidedly lacking in both humor and warmth. After her resignation almost four years previously, the post of director of the IHA had eventually been filled by the Minnesotan. Blumberg would not have even made it onto her short list, as she considered him merely competent at best&#x2014;�safe and unimaginative, a plodder&#x2014;�but she&#x2019;d had no say in his appointment.<br><br>She turned her attention back to the screens. The main display showed a pilot&#x2019;s-�eye view of the submersible&#x2019;s voyage, but one of the smaller monitors flanking it had an angle on one of its passengers, standing on a landing skid: Eddie. &#x201c;How much farther?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>An Australian voice came over the comm. &#x201c;Be there in about three minutes,&#x201d; said the couple&#x2019;s friend Matt Trulli from inside the sub. It could accommodate three, but today he was the only person in the cabin, making it far less cramped than normal.<br><br>The two men holding on to its hull had no such luxuries. On the other skid was a second diver, Nerio Cellini. The Italian was young, only in his mid-�twenties, but he already had years of experience in underwater exploration. His enthusiasm made Nina nostalgic for the time when she had been filled with the same youthful vigor, and also a little jealous of it.<br><br>&#x201c;I see the site,&#x201d; Cellini reported.<br><br>Nina looked back at the main monitor. The blue-�green lasers used to pierce the water&#x2019;s murky cloak had the side effect of leaching away all color except an eerie turquoise, but a small patch of white faded into sight at the screen&#x2019;s center. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; she asked Blumberg.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;The Temple of Poseidon.&#x201d;<br><br>The glow came from powerful spotlights standing on the roof of a massive structure rising from the seafloor. Even in ruins, the centerpiece of the lost city was still awe inspiring. When Nina had first discovered it, the great temple had been largely buried by silt. Most of the surrounding sediment had since been cleared, but the building itself had suffered massive damage when her survey ship was deliberately scuttled and smashed down on top of it. Some of the RV Evenor&#x2019;s remains were still in place, the wreck too big and costly to remove entirely. But parts had been cut away to give access to what remained of the temple.<br><br>The submersible approached the northern end of the huge vaulted ruin. The lights encircled an area where the damaged roof had been carefully opened up. Beneath it was the altar room, not merely a place of religious importance but also an archive: The entire history of the Atlantean civilization was recorded within, scribed into the sheets of gold alloy covering the walls. Some had been lost when the ceiling collapsed, but others were still intact, including an account of the doomed civilization&#x2019;s last hours.<br><br>It was a different record that the expedition hoped to discover, however.<br><br>&#x201c;Matt, move to drop-�off position,&#x201d; Blumberg ordered. &#x201c;Nerio, Eddie, you&#x2019;re up.&#x201d;<br><br>The submersible stopped above the ring of lights, pulsing its thrusters at low power to hold position against the ocean&#x2019;s slow but relentless current. &#x201c;Okay, guys, we&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; said Matt. The two divers each collected an equipment case, then Eddie leaned his shaved head closer to the camera and grinned at Nina, revealing the gap between his two front teeth, before stepping off the skid.<br><br>&#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; she told him.<br><br>���<br><br>&#x201c;Hope we don&#x2019;t need it,&#x201d; Eddie replied. The deep suit&#x2014;�comprising a hard casing around his body that let him breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure to eliminate any risk of the bends, heavy-�duty seals at the shoulders and hips allowing his dry-�suited limbs to move freely&#x2014;�was neutrally buoyant, but the case was heavy enough to let him drift lazily downward. A spool of hair-�thin fiber-�optic communications line played out behind him, keeping him in direct contact with the sub and the IHA. His feet made gentle contact with the ancient stone. &#x201c;Touchdown! It didn&#x2019;t collapse, so that&#x2019;s a good start.&#x201d;<br><br>Cellini landed a few feet away. &#x201c;This part of the temple should be very stable,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Only below the altar room is it . . .&#x201d; He searched for the best English word, waggling his free hand from side to side. &#x201c;Wobbly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And guess where we&#x2019;re going.&#x201d; Eddie sighed. He became more serious as he surveyed his surroundings.<br><br>He had visited the altar room before, as well as near-�identical copies the Atlanteans had built after abandoning their homeland, one in a vast cavern within a Himalayan mountain, the other deep in the jungles of Brazil. The archaeologists cataloging the lost city on the Amazon had since discovered more chambers beneath its altar room&#x2014;�not hidden, exactly, but neither had they been immediately obvious. Meanwhile, the teams exploring Atlantis itself had uncovered references to a previously unknown treasure held somewhere within the Temple of Poseidon, and all the clues pointed to one of those secondary rooms.<br><br>There were two problems. The first was that nobody was sure if the Brazilian temple&#x2019;s chambers were exact duplicates of the original&#x2014;�sonar searches suggested open spaces beneath this altar room, but the results were far from conclusive. The second, and bigger, was that even if they existed, the Evenor&#x2019;s destructive landing had dropped countless tons of debris into the temple&#x2019;s interior, making it impossible to know what was beneath.<br><br>Until someone remembered that Nina and Eddie had been inside the temple while it was still intact . . .<br><br>There was a camera mounted on the Yorkshireman&#x2019;s right shoulder. &#x201c;Nina, you seeing this?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, all looking good,&#x201d; his wife replied. &#x201c;I can see the stairs.&#x201d;<br><br>An opening in one wall descended into darkness. The rubble blocking it had been removed, only for the IHA&#x2019;s explorers to find another, more solid obstruction farther down. Small underwater drones had been able to squeeze past it to confirm that the stairway continued beyond, but they in turn were stymied by further debris. To the frustration of their controllers, the second blockage looked loose enough to be cleared by hand, but the little robots lacked the power to do so.<br><br>Which was why, the previous day, Cellini and another diver had used precision explosive charges to split apart the first obstacle. The blast had stirred up debris and sediment, turning the water in the tunnel completely opaque. It had now settled, so he and Eddie could determine if the stairway was passable and, if so, explore its depths.<br><br>The Italian gestured to his dive partner. &#x201c;Are you ready?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Eddie replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try not to wreck the entire place.&#x201d; He smiled to reassure the younger man, who clearly knew his reputation.<br><br>Blumberg&#x2019;s voice came through his earpiece. &#x201c;That would be appreciated this time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twat,&#x201d; said Eddie under his breath, though deliberately just loud enough for his microphone to pick it up. The IHA&#x2019;s director was making an implied criticism of his predecessor and her husband; despite their best efforts, the Temple of Poseidon was far from the only archaeological site to be seriously damaged after Nina had discovered it.<br><br>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Must have been a fish farting. Okay, Nerio, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie used the controller stalk attached to the deep suit&#x2019;s chest to start its ducted propellers, gliding at low speed to the entrance. Cellini touched down beside him, directing his suit&#x2019;s lights down the steeply sloping passage. Stone steps receded into the murk for about twenty feet before the path came to an abrupt halt.<br><br>A huge stone slab had been dislodged from the ceiling, pulverizing everything beneath it. It had originally come to rest at an angle, leaving a gap just big enough for the drones. Now, though, the space was much larger. The explosives had split the great block in two, the lower half dropping onto the steps and the upper wedging against it.<br><br>Rather than use the thrusters, Eddie carefully walked to the slab and took a powerful handheld light from his case, shining it over the carved stone. It looked as if the divers could swim past&#x2014;�but first there was a question that had to be answered.<br><br>Cellini voiced it. &#x201c;Is it safe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who am I, Dustin Hoffman?&#x201d; Eddie waited for a reply, but got only a bemused stare from the young man. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t seen Marathon Man?&#x201d; Another blank look. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t even heard of . . . Oh, I give up. Kids today!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just wait until our kid&#x2019;s older,&#x201d; Nina joked. &#x201c;Macy&#x2019;ll be like, &#x2018;Dad, all your cultural references are from the twentieth century! Mom&#x2019;s the archaeologist, not me.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I dunno, if ever a kid was destined to follow in her mother&#x2019;s footsteps . . .&#x201d; He used his hands to test the blocks. They stayed firm.<br><br>Cellini added his torchlight to the Englishman&#x2019;s. &#x201c;So we will fit, yes? Help me through.&#x201d; He swam to the gap. &#x201c;Is my suit clear?&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie checked. There would only be a small space between the suit&#x2019;s fiberglass casing and the stone. &#x201c;Roll on your right so you don&#x2019;t bang your air tank cover on the ceiling.&#x201d; Cellini did so. &#x201c;Okay, try to get through. Don&#x2019;t use your legs&#x2014;�I&#x2019;ll push you.&#x201d;<br><br>Bracing himself, he carefully assisted the other man into the opening. Despite their best efforts, the suit scraped against the tight surrounds, with a tense moment when the control stalk caught the stone block, but a small roll brought Cellini clear. The hard carapace finally slipped through, and the Italian immediately angled downward to get clear. &#x201c;I made it!&#x201d; he cried.<br><br>&#x201c;Wind out some of your fiber optic so it won&#x2019;t catch when I come through,&#x201d; Eddie told him. Cellini acknowledged. &#x201c;All right, here I come.&#x201d;<br><br>He followed the other man into the opening. Cellini helped him through. Again, the inflexible fiberglass rasped against the stonework, but even though Eddie was considerably stockier than the lithe young man, the bodies of their deep suits were identical; if one could fit, so could its twin. A quick twist, and the Englishman was free.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m through,&#x201d; he told his listeners, bringing himself back upright. Without the spill of illumination from the altar room, the passage beyond the broken slab was much darker. He used his lamp to scan the floor, then the ceiling. &#x201c;Looks like some bits came loose from above,&#x201d; he said, examining the broken stonework littering the steps.<br><br>&#x201c;Is the ceiling intact?&#x201d; Nina asked nervously.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but there are some cracks. Let&#x2019;s not stay in here too long, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the second blockage?&#x201d; said Blumberg. &#x201c;The robots couldn&#x2019;t get through it&#x2014;�will you be able to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll soon find out.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie and Cellini carefully made their way down the sloping tunnel. Before long, another obstruction appeared. Eddie had seen a photo of the pile of rubble before diving, and saw at once that something had changed. Cellini realized the same thing. &#x201c;The explosion, it must have dislodged some of the stones,&#x201d; he said. Although loose, the pile had previously reached to the roof, but now there were open areas at its top.<br><br>&#x201c;We still won&#x2019;t fit through, though. Good job we brought these!&#x201d; Eddie set down his case and opened it. Among other tools, it contained a steel crowbar and a folding shovel. He took out the former and made a few exploratory probes at the debris. The smashed stones shifted easily. &#x201c;You were right about it being loose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long do you think it&#x2019;ll take to get through?&#x201d; asked Blumberg.<br><br>&#x201c;Probably only a few minutes,&#x201d; the Yorkshireman reported, knocking away a couple more pieces.<br><br>���<br><br>&#x201c;Just make it a clean job,&#x201d; said Blumberg. &#x201c;Smashing priceless sites apart isn&#x2019;t my style.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina looked at the cardigan-�clad man, whose retreating hairline had been feebly camouflaged by a swooping comb-�over, but decided to keep her thoughts on his ideas of style to herself. Instead, she turned back to the monitors. Eddie and Cellini were indeed opening up the gap quite quickly. She was about to ask one of them to see if anything was visible beyond when someone entered the room. She sat up in surprise when she saw the new arrival. &#x201c;Oswald, hi!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And hello to you too, Nina,&#x201d; replied Oswald Seretse. The urbane Gambian diplomat had acted as the IHA&#x2019;s interim director before Blumberg was appointed, but had since returned to the role of bureaucratic liaison between the semi-�independent agency and the United Nations, with which she was sure he was far more comfortable. &#x201c;I heard you were in the building.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The UN grapevine&#x2019;s as quick as it ever was, I see,&#x201d; she said, standing to shake his hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Three years, I believe. How is Macy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Three years, I believe,&#x201d; Nina echoed, grinning. &#x201c;No, she&#x2019;s great. Very precocious.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled. &#x201c;I am not surprised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;re responsible for getting me involved with this operation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am certain Lester would have remembered in due course that you and Eddie have personal knowledge of the temple&#x2019;s interior,&#x201d; said Seretse, greeting Blumberg. &#x201c;After all, everyone at the IHA has surely read your book.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Blumberg replied, hastily enough to give Nina the impression that he had skimmed it at best.<br><br>&#x201c;My first book,&#x201d; she told Seretse. &#x201c;The second&#x2019;s finished, and should be out by the end of the year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have already read it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your publisher sent me proofs of the manuscript so it could be vetted for security purposes.

His most famous views&#x2015;the will to power, the eternal recurrence, the <i>�bermensch</i>, the master morality&#x2015;often seem incomprehensible or, worse, repugnant. Yet he remains a thinker of singular importance, a great opponent of Hegel and Kant, and the source of much that is powerful in figures as diverse as Wittgenstein, Derrida, Heidegger, and many recent American philosophers.</p><p>Alexander Nehamas provides the best possible guide for the perplexed. He reveals the single thread running through Nietzsche&#x2019;s views: his thinking of the world on the model of a literary text, of people as if they were literary characters, and of knowledge and science as if they were literary interpretation. Beyond this, he advances the clarity of the concept of textuality, making explicit some of the forces that hold texts together and so hold us together. Nehamas finally allows us to see that Nietzsche is creating a literary character out of himself, that he is, in effect, playing the role of Plato to his own Socrates.</p><p>Nehamas discusses a number of opposing views, both American and European, of Nietzsche&#x2019;s texts and general project, and reaches a climactic solving of the main problems of Nietzsche interpretation in a step-by-step argument. In the process he takes up a set of very interesting questions in contemporary philosophy, such as moral relativism and scientific realism. This is a book of considerable breadth and elegance that will appeal to all curious readers of philosophy and literature.</p></p><p>Nietzsche is an author, a public figure, and all his writings are relevant to his interpretation. The importance we attach to any part of his work cannot depend on general principles about which is essentially primary and which necessarily follows.Alexander Nehamas is Edmund N.

A Senior Counterinsurgency Advisor to General David Petraeus in Iraq, his vision of war dramatically influenced America's decision to rethink its military strategy in Iraq and implement "the surge."<p>Now, in <i>The Accidental Guerrilla</i>, Kilcullen provides a remarkably fresh perspective on the War on Terror. Kilcullen takes us "on the ground" to uncover the face of modern warfare, illuminating both the big global war (the "War on Terrorism") and its relation to the associated "small wars" across the globe: Iraq, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Chechnya, Pakistan and North Africa. Kilcullen sees today's conflicts as a complex pairing of contrasting trends: local social networks and worldwide movements; traditional and postmodern culture; local insurgencies seeking autonomy and a broader pan-Islamic campaign. He warns that America's actions in the war on terrorism have tended to conflate these trends, blurring the distinction between local and global struggles and thus enormously complicating our challenges. Indeed, the US had done a poor job of applying different tactics to these very different situations, continually misidentifying insurgents with limited aims and legitimate grievances (whom he calls "accidental guerrillas") as part of a coordinated worldwide terror network. We must learn how to disentangle these strands, develop strategies that deal with global threats, avoid local conflicts where possible, and win them where necessary.</p> <p>Colored with gripping battlefield experiences that range from the jungles and highlands of Southeast Asia to the mountains of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to the dusty towns of the Middle East, <i>The Accidental Guerrilla</i> will, quite simply, change the way we think about war. This much anticipated book will be a must read for everyone concerned about the war on terror.</p></p><p><br><strong>David Kilcullen</strong> was formerly counterinsurgency advisor to General David Petraeus in Iraq and to the NATO Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and currently serves as a consultant to the U.S. government. Kilcullen is also Adjunct Professor of Security Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a Fellow at the Center for a New American Security.<br>Starred Review. Kilcullen, adviser on counterinsurgency to General Petraeus, defines accidental guerrillas as locals fighting primarily because outsiders (often Westerners) are intruding into their physical and cultural space, but they may also be galvanized by high-tech, internationally oriented ideologues. This interaction of two kinds of nonstate opponents renders both traditional counterterrorism and counterinsurgency inadequate. Kilcullen uses Afghanistan and Iraq as primary case studies for a new kind of war that relies on an ability to provoke Western powers into protracted, exhausting, expensive interventions. Kilcullen presents two possible responses. Strategic disruption keeps existing terrorists off balance. Military assistance attacks the conditions producing accidental guerrillas. That may mean full-spectrum assistance, involving an entire society. Moving beyond a simplistic war on terror depends on rebalancing military and nonmilitary elements of power. It calls for a long view, a measured approach and a need to distinguish among various enemies. It requires limiting the role of government agencies in favor of an indirect approach emphasizing local interests and local relationships. Not least, Kilcullen says, breaking the terrorist cycle requires establishing patterns of virtue, moral authority, and credibility in the larger society. Kilcullen's compelling argument merits wide attention. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These days no one is shocked when an administrative assistant buys silk pajamas at Victoria's Secret. Or a young professional buys only Kendall-Jackson premium wines. Or a construction worker splurges on a $3,000 set of Callaway golf clubs.<br><br> In dozens of categories, these new luxury brands now sell at huge premiums over conventional goods, and in much larger volumes than traditional old luxury goods. <i>Trading Up</i> has become the definitive book about this growing trend.</p><p>Michael J.

He works with leading companies around the world.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Neil Fiske is the former head of the Chicago office of The Boston Consulting Group and is now the CEO of Bath &amp; Body Works.</p><br><p>John Butman is an established business author and journalist.</p>In Bobos in Paradise, David Brooks traced the cultural forces behind the rise of what he called the bohemian bourgeois class. Now Silverstein and Fiske take a close look at its buying patterns. Both authors have v-p-level experience at the Boston Consulting Group studying retail practices, and they display deep familiarity with "new luxury" goods favored by a growing segment of the American middle market with more disposable income than ever. They're talking about people who take shopping tips from Oprah and Martha, swear their washing machine makes them happy, and dine at "fast casual" restaurants instead of burger chains. Many chapters focus on companies that produce specific luxury items. Victoria's Secret, for example, was a small, seedy store before it was purchased by a visionary retailer convinced American women would be willing to pay higher prices for attractive lingerie in a boutique setting. There's also the case of Callaway Golf, which was able to target new luxury shoppers to achieve a tenfold increase in revenue within just three years. Even the toy market can become a breeding ground for high-end items, like American Girl dolls, a line with an extensive back story that appeals to the luxury consumer's desire to "know" the pedigree of his or her purchases (just as some wine aficionados jump at the chance to display their mastery of California vintages). Despite the book's slight technical flaws, including a high degree of repetitiveness, its insights into a highly lucrative market (e.g., single women earn in excess of $374 billion annually) make this a must read for anyone interested in practical economics.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Primitive Skills and Crafts: An Outdoorsman&#39;s Guide to Shelters, Tools, Weapons, Tracking, Survival, and More</h2><p>Here are ancient techniques that can be adapted for the modern outdoorsman-making stone blades and ax handles, cordage and sandals, cooking fires and stone ovens, trapping and more.

Sheinkin lives in Saratoga Springs, New York, with his wife and two children.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;In this thoroughly researched, thoughtfully produced, and beautifully written book, Sheinkin delves into the life of Daniel Ellsberg, former Pentagon consultant and a self-described "cold warrior," who gradually made an about-face with regard to America's presence in Vietnam. Ellsberg famously leaked the Pentagon Papers, a lengthy document written by military insiders about the Vietnam War, to various members of the press in 1971. He was quickly labeled an enemy of the state and a traitor to his country, aka the most dangerous man in America. With access to many of the key players in this real-life drama, as well as mountains of source material, Sheinkin builds a narrative that is at once accessible and suspenseful, with revelations and details coming at just the right moments. In Sheinkin's careful hands, Ellsberg and others, including Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and Robert McNamara, are fully realized characters with strengths, flaws, and motivations that grow ever more clear as the story unfolds. Direct quotes, primary source documents, and archival photographs are peppered throughout, supplementing and complementing the text. Meticulous source notes indicate the level of research and time that the author has put into this particular work. With the news filled with stories about Edward Snowden and the NSA, Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, and privacy rights and government overreach, this brilliant work about an extraordinary whistle-blower taking a stand should be on everyone's reading list.

Even before he rose he was scrabbling forward across the forest floor on hands and knees, his pulse drumming in his ears. Only when he was some dozen paces away from the tree did he dare turn and look.<br><br>The moonlight seeping through the ancient trees did not reveal much of the thing that had touched him but cast enough silvery light for Morgan to know he had never seen another creature like it. It was smaller than his young sister, which eased his fears some, but it was no animal he could recognize, neither bear cub nor ape. Its startled black eyes were huge and, before the creature turned and vanished into the upper part of the tree, he even caught a glimpse of hands that seemed to have fingers instead of claws.<br><br>Morgan sat on the damp ground as the moon slid out of sight again behind the trees. He shivered, waiting for his heart to slow, wanting to weep but not daring to make a sound. He had no idea which direction he had come from or how long he had run.<br><br>I&#x2019;m lost, he realized. Alone in Aldheorte Forest. Lost. It hit him like a blow.<br><br>He badly wanted a drink of something strong.<br><br>Morgan woke from a harrowing, dark dream of tripping roots and tangling branches, of vines that clutched and dragged him down like vengeful ghosts, to discover that, instead of angry phantoms, a bright blue summer sky peeked at&nbsp;him from between the branches overhead, and the warm morning air was full&nbsp;of the scent of green things.<br><br>He had but a single moment to appreciate the relief, the perfect innocence of the day; then as he tried to untangle himself from his cloak he rolled over and fell out of the tree where he had fallen asleep. He was slowed in his tumble by branches beneath; he was lucky to have climbed only a couple of times his own height. Still, branches scratched and gouged him in several places before he struck the ground.<br><br>At first he could only lie panting, testing his limbs to see if he had injured himself badly. So much, he thought, for the safety of perching in trees.<br><br>Thank our merciful lord Usires I didn&#x2019;t climb any higher!<br><br>But his next thought was, What will happen to me? Is anyone searching? Are any of the others I came with even alive? He remembered the last time he had seen poor old Count Eolair, and his insides clutched in fear and sorrow for the count and Porto, for Binabik the troll and his family. Morgan did his best to push bleak thoughts away. He was a prince, he reminded himself; he could not let fears or unhappiness unman him. And he had not seen any bodies back at the camp except for Erkynguards, so it was even possible Snenneq and Qina and the rest had survived. But it was hard to believe it.<br><br>He desperately wanted a drink. A jug of wine would make the aches go away, and the worries, too. How had he been such a fool as to leave his flask at the camp, when he and Eolair first departed with the Sithi? Porto had probably drunk all of Morgan&#x2019;s brandy. If the old knight had lived long enough.<br><br>Morgan was torn between genuine fear for his comrade and the idea that the last of the brandy might have been wasted on someone who wouldn&#x2019;t live to appreciate it.<br><br>Now past the first shock of his fall, Morgan climbed unsteadily to his feet and began gathering the things that had tumbled from the branch with him&#x2014;�his sword, water skin, and lastly his dark green cloak, which he had wrapped around himself during a particularly cold stretch in the middle of the night. He sat beneath the beech and laid them all out on the damp ground around him, then untied his purse from his belt and emptied its contents onto the spread cloak.<br><br>The pouch that held his flint and steel for making fire were the first thing that struck his eye, and he promptly thanked God. But other than his mail shirt and the clothes he wore under it, he did not have much&#x2014;�his sword and his dagger and the things he had dumped from the purse. He examined the small pile, an unhappily brief inventory.<br><br>Flint and steel.<br><br>His mother&#x2019;s Book of the Aedon.<br><br>A bundle wrapped in leaves that he didn&#x2019;t recognize but prayed was something to eat.<br><br>The spiked foot-�irons that Snenneq had given him for walking on ice, as useless here in the summer forest as teats on a boar.<br><br>But there was still a weight in the purse. He reached in to see what it was. Someone&#x2014;�his squire Melkin or perhaps even Snenneq the troll&#x2014;�had coiled up a few fathoms of slender cord and knotted them into a tight bundle at the bottom of the purse. He was unspeakably grateful to whoever had done it. If nothing else, he could use the rope to help make a shelter.<br><br>Or hang myself, he thought, then said a hasty prayer of apology. Why give God ideas?<br><br>Prayer over, he swiftly turned his attention to the leaf-�wrapped parcel. He and Eolair had last eaten at the camp of the scarred Sitha Khendraja&#x2019;aro. Morgan had not eaten much, although the food had been very good. It was hard not to curse himself now for having stinted when he could have feasted&#x2014;�but how could he have guessed what would happen next?<br><br>For the love of Our Lord, what will I find to eat here in the wood?<br><br>To his great relief, the bundle of leaves turned out be food that either old Porto or Morgan&#x2019;s squire Melkin had put there for him&#x2014;�hard cheese, bread, and an apple, all wrapped in grape leaves. But where did the apple come from? Morgan couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time they had been near a tree. Still, the rest of the food would keep a while longer, but the fruit was already softening, so he took a bite and for a moment was almost restored to happiness simply by the taste.<br><br>So I&#x2019;m not such a fool as my grandfather thinks me, he told himself. Not helpless. Look at what I have with me&#x2014;�a knife, some food, flint and steel for fire. The moment of satisfaction was interrupted by a memory of his grandfather&#x2019;s friend, Jeremias the Lord Chamberlain, who had strongly criticized Morgan&#x2019;s leather belt-�purse.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the kind of thing peasants and pilgrims wear,&#x201d; Jeremias had told him. &#x201c;And you, Highness, are neither.&#x201d;<br><br>Well, Lord Purse-�Hater, Morgan thought, who&#x2019;s right and who&#x2019;s wrong now? Then he realized he was sitting alone in a huge forest with no idea of how to get home, arguing in his head with someone who wasn&#x2019;t there.<br><br>&#x201c;When you wind up in one of those bad situations,&#x201d; his grandfather had once told him, &#x201c;sometimes you just have to get on with things. Just get on with them. Keep going. Keep pushing forward.&#x201d; Now, years later, the king&#x2019;s words finally began to make sense. Just during the time he had been staring at his few possessions the sun had moved higher in the sky, passing from below one branch to above it, hurry�ing toward its eventual noon summit, after which it would roll down into darkness again.<br><br>The food in his purse would not last long, and Morgan knew nothing of what might be edible in Aldheorte other than a few berries. He had not caught a rabbit since his childhood, while pretending to be wandering heroes with some of the other high-�born children of the Hayholt. He hoped he still remembered how to make a snare.<br><br>If you remain here you&#x2019;ll starve, he told himself. You must do something. Think, Morgan, think!<br><br>The most obvious plan was to try to find his way back to the edge of the forest. It had been hard to guess where to go before, but that had been while he was with the Sithi, and doubtless was due to some kind of heathen spell meant to confuse outsiders. There should be no reason now to doubt the sun&#x2019;s path and the directions it would give him.<br><br>He bundled everything back into the purse, then looked up in the sky to calculate how the sun had moved before setting out toward what he felt sure was the south, toward the nearby grasslands. Despite his worries&#x2014;�and a fierce thirst for something strong, a thirst that was growing, not easing&#x2014;�he felt brave enough to whistle as he walked. It was only when he recalled that whoever had attacked the camp might well be searching for him that he fell silent.<br><br>By the middle of the afternoon Morgan could not have mustered the courage to whistle even if he had wanted to. His stomach was cramping painfully and his legs ached, but he could not seem to make any progress. After the sun crossed the peak of the sky he kept the line of its descent to his right, which should have taken him back to the forest&#x2019;s edge. Instead, as the afternoon wore on he found himself still deep in the shadows of the tall trees, hornbeam and lindens and spreading Erkynland oaks, a darkness alleviated only by an occasional sun-�scoured clearing or patch of marshy bottomland between hills. He had walked for far longer now than he could possibly have run the night before, no matter his terror. But even with the Sithi no longer about, their forest magic still seemed to afflict him.<br><br>He stopped to take stock, resting against the trunk of a broad beech tree halfway up a hillside. He&#x2019;d finished the apple hours before, and squeezed and sucked the juice out of its core, then crunched up the seeds between his teeth so as not to waste any of it, feeling almost virtuous as he did so. But now hunger was a constant companion, so he pulled a piece of crust off the bread and ate it with a few morsels of cheese. That helped a little, but he still pined desperately for some strong drink. The thought of it and the frustration of having none was a constant misery.<br><br>The problem with where he was going seemed simpler to solve: he knew that in a general way the grasslands and the Ymstrecca must be south of him somewhere, but he did not know how deep in the forest he was. He wiped the sweat from his brow and peered up a nearby slope. If he climbed straight up, it seemed likely he would see something of his surroundings from the hilltop. He might even be able to see the edge of the forest and how far he still had to travel.<br><br>The climb took no little while because the slope was steep and covered with brush and fallen trees. By the time Morgan reached the top the sun had sunk considerably farther toward the horizon. He made his way across the summit until he found an open space where the trees fell away at the edge of a stand of ghostly birches. He looked out at the sea of trees spread below him&#x2014;�a sea with no shore.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair!&#x201d; he cried. A jay squawked its disapproval at him. &#x201c;Not fair!&#x201d;<br><br>In every direction, the forest stretched away in all directions, nothing but endless treetops and a few hills here and there like the one on which he was standing, isolated islands in the green and brown ocean of leaves.<br><br>His eyes misted with tears of frustration and fear chilled him. He desperately longed to be able to drink himself witless.<br><br>The Sithi called their villages &#x201c;little boats.&#x201d; How he longed to see such a thing now. He wouldn&#x2019;t care if it was the camp of that scarred villain Khendraja&#x2019;aro himself.<br><br>Morgan&#x2019;s knees felt weak, so he leaned against a birch trunk. The sun was even lower, its light skipping over dark places where the evening mists were already beginning to form. He wiped his eyes, angry with himself for this moment of weakness, but not strong enough to do anything else yet.<br><br>I&#x2019;m going to die here. At that moment there seemed no other possibilty. Starved, or frozen, or after falling down and breaking my neck. Wolves. Bears. And nobody will ever know what happened to me.<br>&#x201c;Kill the nobleman and take his clothes. He&#x2019;s got nothing else of worth.&#x201d;<br><br>Count Eolair, Lord Steward, Hand of the Throne, hero of the Storm King&#x2019;s War, was all but picked up by a sneering Thrithings-�man and thrown to the ground.<br><br>The rough, bearded men outnumbered Eolair by six to one. His tormentors wore pieces of armor that did not quite match, many of them in dirty surcoats from which the emblems had long ago been torn. The one who had thrown Eolair down stabbed at him with a sword, but it was meant to wound rather than kill&#x2014;�this grasslander wanted sport, first&#x2014;�and the count rolled out of the way so that the man&#x2019;s thrust only pierced his cloak and pinned it to the ground.<br><br>One of the other riders dismounted, saying, &#x201c;Stay your blade, Hurza.&#x201d; The newcomer was young, but Eolair guessed by the easy way he gave the order that he must be the leader. He stared down at Eolair, mouth twisted in a smirk. His cheeks bore ceremonial scars, and numerous small, ornamental bones had been knotted in his fair hair and beard. Like the others, he wore no Thrithings clan-�sign, which confirmed for Eolair that they were most likely free-�roving bandits. &#x201c;We can kill him any time we like. I want to know what he&#x2019;s doing here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I will be very willing to tell you,&#x201d; said Eolair, &#x201c;but I would like to stand up first.&#x201d; He lifted himself into a sitting position. Hurza&#x2019;s blade was still in Eolair&#x2019;s cloak; as the cloth ripped, a piece of it remained tacked to the ground. The grasslander scowled but did not argue with his young chieftain. Hurza withdrew his sword, then slowly wiped the mud from its tip on the count&#x2019;s leg before sheathing it again. &#x201c;Unless you are all of you afraid of a single Hernystirman twice your age,&#x201d; Eolair added.<br><br>&#x201c;More than twice mine, I guess,&#x201d; answered the bandit leader, grinning now. &#x201c;But as I said, there is no hurry in killing you, so tell us&#x2014;�what is a Hernystiri rabbit-�eater doing on our land?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it yours? I see no clan emblem on any of you.&#x201d; Eolair knew he was courting death by such bold replies, but the men of the Thrithings respected courage, and he might as well be killed for a leopard as for a lamb. He also had the feeling that the young one truly did want to hear him out, if only because the chieftain was smarter and more practical than his followers. Also, but not least in importance, Eolair saw three more members of the bandit company still poking around in a disgruntled manner near the fringe of the forest where Morgan had disappeared, and he wanted badly to keep the rest of them distracted. &#x201c;I am Eolair, Lord Steward of Erkynland. I am here because I was on a mission for the High Throne.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A mission?&#x201d; The chief laughed. &#x201c;To who? The Fox Clan? Or the Sparrows? Or were you on your way to visit the fat villagers of New Gadrinsett?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None of those, nor to any other mortals. I was sent to find the Sithi.&#x201d;<br><br>Several of the other bandits grew nervous at these words; a few spit on the ground and made signs against evil. &#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; said the leader. &#x201c;Now I know you are lying, Hernystirman. Why would anyone want to seek the Forest Folk? And who could find them if the fairies did not wish to be found?&#x201d;<br><br>The men who had been searching the edge of the woods had remounted their horses and were now heading back toward them; Eolair felt a rush of relief. Great Brynioch, thank you. Keep the boy safe, he prayed. Perhaps Jiriki was still waiting nearby and would help Morgan to safety. Despite their bad treatment at Khendraja&#x2019;aro&#x2019;s hands, Eolair thought there were few places outside of the Hayholt where the prince would be safer than with the Sithi.<br><br>&#x201c;We had a horn,&#x201d; he told the bandit leader. &#x201c;One of ...</p><h2>The Shortest Way to Hades</h2><p>It seemed the perfect way to avoid three million in taxes on a five-million-pound estate: change the trust arrangement. Everyone in the family agreed to support the heiress, ravishing raven-haired Camilla Galloway, in her court petition -- except dreary Cousin Deirdre, who suddenly demanded a small fortune for her signature. Then Deirdre had a terrible accident. That was when the young London barristers handling the trust -- Cantrip, Selena, Timothy, Ragwort, and Julia -- summoned their Oxford friend Professor Hilary Tamar to Lincoln&#39;s Inn. Julia thinks it&#39;s murder. Hilary demurs. Why didn&#39;t the heiress die? But when the accidents escalate and they learn of the naked lunch at Uncle Rupert&#39;s, Hilary the Scholar embarks on the most perilous quest of all: the truth....</p><p><b>Sarah Caudwell</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>Thus Was Adonis Murdered, The Shortest Way to Hades,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Sirens Sang of Murder</i>, and <i>The Sibyl in Her Grave</i>. She studied law at St. Anne's College, Oxford; was called to the Chancery Bar; and practiced as a barrister for several years in Lincoln's Inn. She then became a member of the legal department of a major London bank, where she found herself specializing in international tax planning. She died in 2000.In the midst of a legal wrangle among heirs, the single dissenter winds up dead. Did the dreary young woman fall off a roof, or was she pushed? To find out, the stuffy solicitors of said heirs engage an Oxford don, Professor Hillary Tamor, to ferret out the truth. The good professor, as interpreted by Eva Haddon, details the matter with keen observation, wit, and grace. Both author and narrator provide vivid characterization and ample humor, if not much suspense. An irritating distortion mars even moderately loud passages throughout.

In this essay the visual arts of the machine age morph into literature and theory and then back again to images, gestures, and thought. </p><p>This essay, however, is only the beginning of a vast collection of writings that the editors have assembled to demonstrate what was revolutionary about Benjamin&#x2019;s explorations on media. Long before Marshall McLuhan, Benjamin saw that the way a bullet rips into its victim is exactly the way a movie or pop song lodges in the soul.</p><p>This book contains the second, and most daring, of the four versions of the &#x201c;Work of Art&#x201d; essay&#x2015;the one that addresses the utopian developments of the modern media. The collection tracks Benjamin&#x2019;s observations on the media as they are revealed in essays on the production and reception of art; on film, radio, and photography; and on the modern transformations of literature and painting. The volume contains some of Benjamin&#x2019;s best-known work alongside fascinating, little-known essays&#x2015;some appearing for the first time in English. In the context of his passionate engagement with questions of aesthetics, the scope of Benjamin&#x2019;s media theory can be fully appreciated.</p></p><p><p>Walter Benjamin (1892&#x2013;1940) was the author of many works of literary and cultural analysis.</p><p>Michael W. Jennings is Class of 1900 Professor of Modern Languages at Princeton University.</p><p>Brigid Doherty is Associate Professor of German and of Art and Archaeology, Princeton University.</p><p>Thomas Y. Levin is Associate Professor of German at Princeton University.</p>&#x201c;Until recently, Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s seminal essay, <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility</i>, was available to English-speaking readers only in the version that appeared in the 1968 collection <i>Illuminations</i>. Harvard&#x2019;s new volume of the German cultural critic&#x2019;s writings on media offers as its title-piece an earlier, edgier incarnation&#x2015;the second of three composed between 1935 and 1939&#x2015;in a superior translation... Throughout <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility</i>, Benjamin&#x2019;s startling, often oblique language reveals his subjects from unexpected angles... This volume amply demonstrates the keenness and ingenuity of Benjamin&#x2019;s intuitions at the dawn of modern media culture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ross Benjamin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Freshly translated (it used to be called &#x2018;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,&#x2019; which, although more lumberingly Teutonic, has the virtue of evoking an image of robot sex) and newly packaged with an assortment of his other &#x2018;writings on media&#x2019; in a hipster-friendly paperback, Benjamin&#x2019;s best-known work is...well, as they say on Facebook, it&#x2019;s complicated. Man, is it ever complicated. The essay begins by describing the ways film and photography have changed human perception. Benjamin argues that because such exact simulacra of reality can be mass-distributed and mass-consumed, we have a new, more distant relationship to authentic reality&#x2015;and he concludes that these changes in perception clear a path for fascism. Not exactly cheerleadery, then. And while it&#x2019;s easy to be distracted by Benjamin&#x2019;s dusty examples&#x2015;Chaplin&#x2019;s films and Picasso&#x2019;s paintings&#x2015;and therefore lulled into thinking he&#x2019;s describing a different world...well, don&#x2019;t be. Substitute <i>blogs</i> and <i>social-networking platforms</i> and <i>Twitter</i> and <i>YouTube</i> and <i>Wikipedia</i> for <i>film</i> and <i>photography</i>, and the nearly century-old essay becomes a relevant, piercing alarm.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Emily Gould</b><b>, </b><b><i>Technology Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The editors and publisher of this volume deserve credit for organizing its contents thematically rather than chronologically. Such a format encourages readers to approach Benjamin&#x2019;s work discursively, thereby fostering a superior sense of the recurrent ideas, themes, motifs and concepts that Benjamin employed time and again.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Noah Isenberg</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A juicy selection of [Benjamin&#x2019;s] many short pieces on pop culture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Fetherling</b><b>, </b><b><i>Seven Oaks</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility and Other Writings on Media</i> reflects Benjamin&#x2019;s most salient thoughts on media and on culture in general in their most realized form, still maintaining an edge under the skin of everyone who reads it. The visual arts morph into literature and theory and then back to images, gestures and thought. Here the editors have situated this essay as the cornerstone of a vast collection of writings that demonstrates what was revolutionary about Benjamin&#x2019;s explorations on media. He was so prescient, and mind you, Virginia, he was alive only until 1940. We are now talking about 2008 and his work is not just timely, but powerful, important, clairvoyant, and necessary. This is the second and most daring version of the &#x2018;Work of Art&#x2019; essay which tracks Benjamin&#x2019;s observations on the production and reception of art; on film, radio, and photography; on the telephone, on children&#x2019;s books, on Charlie Chaplin and so much more. He was not a critic for the 20th century, he was a theoretician for all time. This volume will probably become a text for some classes, but it is an introduction, a force that must be dealt with by anyone interested in culture, in the media, in the arts, to debates on the digital age. He could explore implications of these themes and be so prescient about what we are experiencing today. Oh, if he were alive today, he would tell us about the future, I am sure. This is a must for anyone who wants to be introduced to Benjamin, or one who wants more and more of what he has to say&#x2015;and this one is thankfully in English.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Umbrella</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In recent decades, Benjamin&#x2019;s essay on the work of art may have been quoted more often than any other single source in an astonishing range of areas&#x2015;from new-left media theory to cultural studies, from film and art history to visual culture, from the postmodern art scene to debates on the future of art, especially film, in the digital age. The antinomies and ambivalences in Benjamin&#x2019;s thinking, his efforts to explore the most extreme implications of opposing stances, are still invaluable for illuminating the contradictions in today&#x2019;s media environment. Anyone interested in the fate of art, perception, and culture in the industrialized world must welcome this collection of Benjamin&#x2019;s writings on media.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Miriam Hansen</b><br><br>&#x201c;In wanting to be a great literary critic [Benjamin] discovered that he could only be the last great literary critic... He explained certain aspects of the modern with an authority that seventy years of unpredictable change have not vitiated.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frank Kermode</b><br><br>&#x201c;Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s work, fragmentary and partly esoteric as it is, fully withstands a comparative measure, and surpasses any of its rivals in philosophic consequences. There has been no more original, no more serious critic and reader in our time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Steiner</b><br><br>&#x201c;This one-volume gathering of Benjamin&#x2019;s dialectical writing on media of all kinds, ranging from children&#x2019;s literature to cinema, has at its heart the second, most expansive version of his path-breaking essay &#x2018;The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility.&#x2019; Readers familiar only with partial versions of this piece, where Benjamin began to record the melancholy loss of aesthetic presence at the turn of the twentieth century, will find their understanding transformed&#x2015;for this second version, like all the essays and supplemental texts included here, explores a set of latent, utopian possibilities inherent in mechanical means of art-making. Benjamin, the visionary magus of particulars, reveals profoundly, and repeatedly, both the grounds and the consequences of our ever-changing image of the made world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Susan Stewart</b></p><h2>Journey to the Centre of the Earth (Bantam Classics)</h2><p>Written almost a century before the daring flights of the astronauts, Jules Verne&#x2019;s prophetic novel of man&#x2019;s race to the stars is a classic adventure tale enlivened by broad satire and scientific acumen. <br><br>When the members of the elite Baltimore Gun Club find themselves lacking any urgent assignments at the close of the Civil War, their president, Impey Barbicane, proposes that they build a gun big enough to launch a rocket to the moon.

Now, his winning streak will continue with this latest work--a collection of appealing, funny, and surprisingly moving essays on life, happiness, and getting through the slumps.<br><br> Filled with another delightful helping of Yogi's inimitable and unwittingly wise aphorisms, these reflections focus on the valuable lessons he's learned on and off the field. From his early years as an immigrant's son who dropped out of the eighth grade through his triumphant career as a player and manager who played in a record seventy-five World Series games, Yogi illustrates his homespun philosophies with apt analogies to his trove of baseball stories. He expounds on such topics as Patience (Waiting for your pitch); Sacrifice (Laying down a bunt); Trusting Others (Taking direction); and Staying Focused (Keeping your eye on the ball), to show how the rules of life and baseball are uncannily similar. And, in the tradition of <em>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</em> and <em>All I Really Need to I Know I Learned in Kindergarten</em>, he explains his recipe for fulfillment and happiness with life lessons that are profoundly simple, simply profound--and classic Yogi to the core. Following on the heels of two <em>New York Times</em> bestselling books and filled with memorable photos, this new collection of Yogi wisdom will undoubtedly expand his growing legion of fans. <em>When You Come to a Fork in the Road, Take It!</em> is a wise, humble, touching book that's a guaranteed winner. In short, it's d�j� vu all over again.<br><br> A baseball legend reflects on the following lessons...<br><br> <ul> <li>"A nickel ain't worth a dime any more."</li> <li>"It ain't over til it's over."</li> <li>"You can't think and hit at the same time."</li> <li>"I didn't really say everything I said."</li> <li>"The future ain't what it used to be."</li></ul> . . . and many more.</p><p>Hall of Fame philosopher Yogi Berra's <i>When You Come to a Fork in the Road, Take It!</i> is another volume of musings and malaprops, and the advice implicit in the title is sound indeed. Just listen: "Throughout life you come to serious forks in the road--decisions," Yogi tells us. "Which path do you choose? Sometimes it's tough. People are always afraid of making the wrong choice." Not Yogi, who explains that tragedy lies in paralysis, not bad choices or regrets, and offers personal examples from on and off the field to prop up his profundity.<p> Like its predecessor, <i>The Yogi Book</i>, <i>Fork</i> is essentially a collection of Yogi's well-traveled observations from out of left field, but it's much more than just d�j� vu all over again. Instead of explaining, as he has before, what prompted a particular Yogi-ism or what he was really trying to say, Yogi does his best to go deep. The charm is that Yogi's so guileless, he makes it work--there's sagacity in his simplicity. Each Yogi-ism gets its own short chapter in which Yogi riffs off the phrase to dispense a bit of homespun wisdom and inspiration. "It gets late early out there"--we get old before we're ready, but here's how to cope with it. "If you can't imitate him, don't copy him"--we all need to be true to ourselves. With Yogi's latest career as a successful author, not only ain't it over for him, there's happily no end in sight. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><b>Yogi Berra</b> is a beloved American baseball personality whose exploits with the New York Yankees made him a vital part of the most successful sports franchise ever.

The past few years have shattered this fantasy, as those who've paid the price for globalism's gains have turned to populist and nationalist politicians to express fury at the political, media, and corporate elites they blame for their losses. <br><br>The United States elected an anti-immigration, protectionist president who promised to "put America first" and turned a cold eye on alliances and treaties. Across Europe, anti-establishment political parties made gains not seen in decades. The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.<br><br>And as Ian Bremmer shows in this eye-opening book, populism is still spreading. Globalism creates plenty of both winners and losers, and those who've missed out want to set things right. They've seen their futures made obsolete. They hear new voices and see new faces all about them. They feel their cultures shift. They don't trust what they read. They've begun to understand the world as a battle for the future that pits "us" vs. "them." <br><br>Bremmer points to the next wave of global populism, one that hits emerging nations before they have fully emerged. As in Europe and America, citizens want security and prosperity, and they're becoming increasingly frustrated with governments that aren't capable of providing them. To protect themselves, many government will build walls, both digital and physical. For instance...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Brazil and other fast-developing countries, civilians riot when higher expectations for better government aren't being met--the downside of their own success in lifting millions from poverty. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Indonesia, Egypt and other emerging states, frustration with government is on the rise and political battle lines are being drawn. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In China, where awareness of inequality is on the rise, the state is building a system to use the data that citizens generate to contain future demand for change<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, the tools now used to provide essential services for people who've never had them can one day be used to tighten the ruling party's grip on power. <br><br>When human beings feel threatened, we identify the danger and look for allies. We use the enemy, real or imagined, to rally friends to our side. This book is about the ways in which people will define these threats as fights for survival. It's about the walls governments will build to protect insiders from outsiders and the state from its people.<br><br>And it's about what we can do about it.</p><p>Ian Bremmer is the president and founder of Eurasia Group, the leading global political risk research and consulting firm.

"Countries are no longer nations but markets. Borders are erased . . . Everyone can come to our country, and this has cut our salaries and our social protections. This dilutes our cultural identity." Marine Le Pen's four sentences capture every important element of the anxiety rising across the Western world. The borders are open, and the foreigners are coming. They will steal your job. They will cost you your pension and your health care by bankrupting your system. They will pollute your culture. Some of them are killers. Le Pen fell short in her bid to become France's president in 2017, but her message remains compelling for the twenty-first-century politics of us vs. them.<br><br>But this is not a story about Marine Le Pen or Donald J. Trump or any of the other populist powerhouses who have emerged in Europe and the United States in recent years. Spin the camera toward the furious crowd-there's the real story. It's not the messenger that drives this movement. It's the fears, often, if not always, justified, of ordinary people-fears of lost jobs, surging waves of strangers, vanishing national identities, and the incomprehensible public violence associated with terrorism. It's the growing doubt among citizens that government can protect them, provide them with opportunities for a better life, and help them remain masters of their fate.<br><br>As of December 2015, just 6 percent of people in the United States, 4 percent in Germany, 4 percent in Britain, and 3 percent in France believe "the world is getting better." The pessimistic majority suspects that those with power, money, and influence care more about their cosmopolitan world than they do about fellow citizens. Many citizens of these countries now believe that globalization works for the favored few but not for them.<br><br>They have a point.<br><br>Globalization-the cross-border flow of ideas, information, people, money, goods, and services-has resulted in an interconnected world where national leaders have increasingly limited ability to protect the lives and livelihoods of citizens. In the digital age, borders no longer mean what citizens think they mean. In some ways, they barely exist.<br><br>Globalism-the belief that the interdependence that created globalization is a good thing-is indeed the ideology of the elite. Political leaders of the wealthy West have been globalism's biggest advocates, building a system that has propelled ideas, information, people, money, goods, and services across borders at a speed and on a scale without precedent in human history.<br><br>Sure, more than a billion people have risen from poverty in recent decades, and economies and markets have come a long way from the financial crisis. But along with new opportunities come serious vulnerabilities, and the refusal of the global elite to acknowledge the downsides of the new interdependence confirms the suspicions of those losing their sense of security and standard of living that elites in New York and Paris have more in common with elites in Rome and San Francisco than with their discarded countrymen in Tulsa, Turin, Tuscaloosa, and Toulon. "The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia," former White House strategist Steve Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter a few days after Donald Trump's 2016 election victory. "The issue now is about Americans looking to not get fucked over."<br><br>In the United States, the jobs that once lifted generations of Americans into the middle class-and kept them there for life-are vanishing. Crime and drug addiction are rising. While 87 percent of Chinese and 74 percent of Indians told pollsters in 2017 that they believe their country is moving "in the right direction," just 43 percent of Americans said the same.<br><br>In Europe, the European Commission and the unelected bureaucrats who enforce its rules have legislated for its twenty-eight member nations without understanding their varied needs. In recent years, they've failed to halt a debt crisis that forced many Europeans to accept lower wages, higher prices, later retirement, less generous pensions, and an uncertain future, all while telling them they must bail out foreign countries that have spent their way into debt. In the migrant crisis, globalist European leaders insisted that all EU members must accept Muslim refugees in numbers determined in Brussels, and barricades and a spike in nationalism were the result (I define "nationalism" as one form of us vs. them intended to rally members of one nation against those of other nations).<br><br>Were the wave of populist nationalism sweeping the United States and Europe the only signs of globalism's failure, it would be bad enough. But there's a larger crisis coming. Many of the storms creating turmoil in the U.S. and Europe-particularly technological change in the workplace and broader awareness of income inequality-are now headed across borders and into the developing world, where governments and institutions aren't ready. Developing countries are especially vulnerable, because the institutions that create stability in developing countries are not as sturdy, and social safety nets aren't nearly as strong as in the United States and European Union. They face an even bigger gap between rich and poor, and the reality that new technologies will kill large numbers of the jobs that lifted expectations for a better life will be much harder to manage. In short, just as the financial crisis had a cascading effect through financial markets and real economies around the world, so the sources of anger convulsing Europe and America will send shock waves through dozens of other countries. Some will absorb these shocks. Some of them won't. As poorer people in developing countries become more aware of what they're missing or losing-quality housing, education, jobs, health care, and protection from crime-many will pick up rocks.<br><br>It is not rising China, a new Cold War, the future of Europe, or the risk of a global cyberconflict that will define our societies. It's the efforts of the losers not to get "fucked over," and the efforts of the winners to keep from losing power. Not just in the United States and Europe, but in the developing world too, there will be a confrontation within each society between winners and losers.<br><br>And winners and losers there will be. It's too late to assuage the anger of people whose needs have been neglected for years, too late to stop the technological advances that will exacerbate the inequality and nativism stirred up by globalism. What remains to be seen is who will win-and who will be the scapegoat. In some countries, us vs. them will manifest as the citizens versus the government. In other countries, the division will be between the rich and the poor. In some cases, disgruntled citizens will blame immigrants for their problems, punishing "them." And in other cases, an ethnic majority will turn on an internal ethnic minority, blaming them for the problems.<br><br>"Us vs. them" is a message that will be adopted by both the left and the right. Antiglobalists on the left use "them" to refer to the governing elite, "big corporations," and bankers who enable financial elites to exploit the individual worker or investor. These are the messages we hear from Senator Bernie Sanders and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Antiglobalists on the right use "them" to describe governments that cheat citizens by offering preferential treatment to minorities, immigrants, or any other group that receives explicit protection under the law.<br><br>How will governments choose to react? The weakest will fall away, leaving us with more failed states, like Syria and Somalia. Those still hoping to build open societies will adapt to survive, attempting to rewrite social contracts to create new ways to meet the needs of citizens in a changing world. And many governments that have a stronger grip on power will build walls-both actual and virtual-that separate people from one another and government from citizens.<br><br>We can no more avoid these choices than the world can avoid climate change, and the time is now to begin preparing for a world of higher tides. This is the coming crisis. This is the conflict that will unravel many societies from within.<br><br>How did we get here?<br><br>In Europe and the United States, the battle of nationalism vs. globalism has deep historical roots, but recent history has given it a new intensity. First, there was the earthquake. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 drove anti-EU fury in response to bailouts and austerity in Europe and resentment of Wall Street and its political enablers in the United States. In the United States, the right dismissed the Occupy Wall Street movement as a vapid left-wing fringe group without significance. The left waved off the Tea Party movement as a motley assortment of angry, aging racists intent on "making America white again" and well-heeled Republican Party activists disguised as grassroots patriots. Other Americans ignored both sides as if nothing important were shifting in American politics. The migrant crisis and a series of terrorist attacks then boosted a more xenophobic set of politicians and political parties in Europe. A number of EU member states established temporary border controls, and some openly defied EU rules. Britons voted to take back control of their laws and borders in 2016, and Trump was elected president as a battering ram against globalist elites and the media in the United States.<br><br>Then the anger seemed to abate, and we experienced an illusion of moderation. Barricades in the Balkans and a deal between the EU and Turkey to sharply slow the flow of migrants into Europe eased the refugee crisis and pressure across the continent for another round of border controls. Anti-Muslim firebrand Geert Wilders finished second in Dutch elections in March 2017. Two months later, pro-EU newcomer Emmanuel Macron overcame the challenge from Le Pen to become France's president, though the broader election story was the sound defeat of traditional parties of the center-right and center-left that had dominated French politics for decades in favor of a candidate who, like Trump, had never before run for office.<br><br>The center-left showed renewed strength in Britain, though it relied on large numbers of working-class Brexit voters for its revival. Germany's Angela Merkel, defender of European unity, won a fourth term as chancellor. In the United States, the Trump backlash went into high gear. The new president's approval rating settled into a narrow range between the mid-30s and low 40s, and his legislative agenda stalled. Courts blocked some of his plans, and various scandal investigations kept him distracted, though Democrats found no credible message of their own for U.S. voters.<br><br>The next chapter is now being written, and it will not be a better one. That's because globalism contains the seeds of its own destruction: Even as it makes the world better, it breeds economic and cultural insecurity, and when people act out of fear, bad things happen.<br><br>Economic insecurity<br><br>Globalization creates new economic efficiency by moving production and supply chains to parts of the world where resources-raw materials and workers-are cheapest. In the developing world, the influx of capital from wealthier nations has created the first truly global middle class. In the developed world, this process bolsters the purchasing power of everyday consumers by putting affordable products on store shelves, but it also disrupts lives by killing livelihoods as corporations gain access to workers in poorer countries who will work for lower wages.<br><br>Trade has not become as toxic a political issue in Europe as in the United States. In part, that's because the European Union includes so many small countries that depend on trade for economic growth, and exports are a crucial growth engine for Germany, the EU's largest economy and de facto political leader. In fact, its current account surplus, a measure of the flow of goods, services, and investment into and out of a country, topped China's to become the world's largest in 2016.<br><br>In addition, social safety net protections in many European countries cushion the blow to workers when they're displaced by trade-related change. In exchange for the higher taxes they pay, Europeans enjoy more generous and longer-lasting jobless benefits than Americans, have broader access to health insurance, and pay lower tuition fees for both first-time and older students. Those who champion trade in the U.S. try to make up for these differences with promises that government will provide those who lose when trade moves jobs overseas with so-called "trade adjustment assistance"-money, retraining, and other forms of support. But these benefits are easier to promise before deals are approved than to deliver after they're signed and politicians no longer need to keep their word.<br><br>Beyond trade, globalization boosts technological change by exposing businesses of all kinds to international competition, forcing them to become ever more efficient, which leads to greater investment in game-changing innovations. Advances in automation and artificial intelligence are remaking the workplace for the benefit of efficiency, making the companies that use them more profitable, but workers who lose their jobs and can't be retrained for new ones won't share in the gains. Technological change then disrupts the ways in which globalization creates opportunity and shifts wealth.<br><br>As a result, large numbers of U.S. factory jobs have been lost not to Chinese or Mexican factory workers but to robots. A 2015 study conducted by Ball State University found that automation and related factors, not trade, accounted for 88 percent of lost U.S. manufacturing jobs between 2006 and 2013.<br><br>Broadening the effect, the introduction into the workplace of artificial intelligence is also reducing the number of-and changing the skill sets needed for-a fast-growing number of service sector jobs. The consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company has estimated that 73 percent of work in the food service and accommodations industries could be automated in coming years. More than half of jobs in the retail sector could be lost, and two-thirds of jobs in the finance and insurance sectors are likely to disappear once computers can understand speech as well as humans do. What does that mean for the future of work? What does it mean for the middle class? It means that jobs are eliminated, and the middle class continues to shrink. Though technological change may eventually create more jobs than it kills, there's not much reason for confidence that fired workers will get the education and training they need for tomorrow's more technically sophisticated jobs.<br><br>In the world's wealthiest countries, particularly the United States, wealth inequality has steadily widened as globalism has advanced. According to a study published by Pew Research in December 2015, "After more than four decades of serving as the nation's economic majority, the American middle class is now matched in number by those in the economic tiers above and below it."...</p><h2>Listening for God: How an ordinary person can learn to hear God speak</h2><p>Through personal stories and scriptural principles, author Marilyn Hontz brings new insight to the practice of listening as a spiritual discipline.

This volume, with its erudite introduction by Mario Praz, presents three of the most celebrated Gothic novels: <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>, published pseudonymously in 1765, is one of the first of the genre and the most truly Gothic of the three. <i>Vathek</i> (1786), an oriental tale by an eccentric millionaire, exotically combines Gothic romanticism with the vivacity of The Arabian Nights and is a narrative tour de force. The story of <i>Frankenstein</i> (1818) and the monster he created is as spine-chilling today as it ever was; as in all Gothic novels, horror is the keynote.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>One of the most interesting phenomena in the history of literature, the Gothic novel&#x2014;which flourished from about 1765 to 1825&#x2014;still has much to offer to the modern reader. Supernatural thrills, adventure and suspense, colorful settings, and, in the better examples, literary quality are all present. Unfortunately, true Gothic novels (not simply modern detective stories called "Gothic") are extremely rare books, and have never been as available as they should be.The first member in this collection, Horace Walpole's <i>The</i><i>Castle of Otranto</i>, published as a Christmas book for 1764, was the first and one of the greatest members of the genre. It has also been one of the most influential books in history. It motivated the Gothic revival in the arts, and it probably did more to usher in the early-19th-century Romanticism than any other single work. It also served as the model in plot, characterizations, settings, and tone for &nbsp;hundreds, perhaps thousands of successors.<i>Vathek</i>, by the eccentric British millionaire William Beckford, is generally considered to be the high point of the Oriental tale in English literature. Certainly no one has ever written (in any European tongue) a story which better unifies the stirrings of Gothic romanticism with the color, poetry, and vivacity of the original <i>Arabian Nights</i>.The third novel in this collection, John Polidor's <i>Vampyre</i>, emerged from the same soir�es of ghost-story telling in Geneva that produced Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>. The first full-length vampire story in English, it initiated a very important literary chain that also leads up to the present. Included with Polidori's novel is Lord Byron's little-known <i>Fragment,</i> from which Polidori (who was Byron's physician in Switzerland) plagiarized his plot.These three novels (and the fragment) are still well worth reading. Generations of readers have found thrills and horrors in Walpole's fine work, while <i>Vathek</i> cannot be excelled in its unusual mixture of the bizarre, cruel irony, and masterful narration. Polidori's thriller still conveys chills, and the <i>Fragment</i> makes us all wish that Byron had completed his novel.<br>Unabridged republication of all four texts: second edition (with prefaces) of <i>The Castle of Otranto,</i> and Sir Walter Scott's Introduction; <i>Vathek</i> in Samuel Henley's translation, with full notes; first edition of <i>The Vampyre,</i> with the introductory section; Byron's <i>Fragment.</i> Edited and introduced by E.

The most celebrated of his many other books is The Romantic Agony.</p><h2>The Symbolic Quest</h2><p><p>This book explores the use and development of man's symbolizing capacities-those qualities that make him distinctly human. Dr. Whitmont describes the symbolic approach to a dream, which takes into account a symptom's meaning in reference to an unfolding wholeness of personality. He then presents the view that the instinctual urge for meaning is served by the symbolizing capacities, and that this urge has been repressed in our time.</p><p> In the field of psychology, this symbolic approach is most fully exemplified by the theories of C. G. Jung. The author's contribution includes many differentiations and speculations, especially concerning the problems of relatedness.</p></p><p>In this highly acclaimed work Edward C. Whitmont explores C.G. Jung&#39;s revolutionary discoveries about the archetypal world and the self, offering practical insights into the process of healing and transformation."[Whitmont] has succeeded in what can only be called an act of creative translation. . . . The general reader will get what has not been available before, a clear and lucid statement of the Jungian position, that life has a pattern of wholeness which can only be comprehended symbolically at this moment in time." (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>"Whitmont...enriches the meaning of the myth of the self by taking us beyond the language of 'disease' and 'symptom' into another language world, the world of 'dis-ease' and 'symbol' and 'therapeia'."

Reprint.</p><p>Miles turns 30, and--though he isn't slowing down just yet--he is starting to lose interest in the game of Wall: the one where he tries to climb the wall, fails, gets up, and tries again. Having finally reached a point in his life where he can look back and realize that he has managed to prove his courage and competence, he can move on to bigger and better things. <p> Depending on how you count it, this is the eighth, ninth, tenth, or eleventh book in a series--not all are about Miles or even his extended family. A good place to start is with the first Vorkosigan story, <i>Shards of Honor</i>.</p><i>Author's Note</i>:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A Bujold Reading-Order Guide</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My fantasy novels are not hard to order.

The debate mainlyrevolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with a few adjustments.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i> The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar. <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>. For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.) <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, MilesVorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleetby accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other thingsone can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br>&nbsp;<br>After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Komarr</i> makes another alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes agood Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length. (But it maymake more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not sharesettings or characters with the main body of the series. Most readersrecommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however,which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free-fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; thenovellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 word sand 40,000words) in quote marks.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i><br><i>Shards of Honor</i><br><i>Barrayar</i><br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br>"The Mountains of Mourning"<br>"Weatherman"<br><i>The Vor Game</i><br><i>Cetaganda</i><br><i>Ethan of Athos</i><br><i>Borders of Infinity</i><br>"Labyrinth"<br>"The Borders of Infinity" <br><i>Brothers in Arms</i><br><i>Mirror Dance</i><br><i>Memory</i><br><i>Komarr</i><br><i>A Civil Campaign</i><br>"Winterfair Gifts"<br><i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br><i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i><br><i>CryoBurn</i><br><i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Caveats:<br>&nbsp;<br>The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.

An explanation of the Law they used and how it can be used by anyone.</p><p>For over 70 years, DeVorss Publications has been the proud publisher of Neville Goddard (1905-1972), who was among the last century's most articulate and charismatic purveyors of the philosophy generally called New Thought. He wrote ten books under the solitary pen-name Neville and was a popular speaker on metaphysical themes from the late 1930s until his death in 1972. Possessed of a self-educated and uncommonly sharp intellect, Neville captured the sheer logic of creative-mind principles as perhaps no other figure of his era. <p> In New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, he addressed crowded church pews and packed auditoriums at the peak of his career. He had a radio program and, for a short time, an inspirational television show broadcast from Los Angeles in the mid-1950s. His books and pamphlets were sold at lectures, and he freely allowed students to tape his addresses without charge "&#x20ac;" tapes that continue to informally spread his message today. </p><p> "Leave the mirror and change your face. Leave the world alone and change your conceptions of yourself." NEVILLE</p><p> For all the recent talk of America being a faith-based nation, it was this iconoclastic foreigner from Barbados, West Indies who lived out the promise of religious freedom in a manner, perhaps, that a Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Paine would have smiled upon. Through the force of intellect and self-study, Neville developed a personal theology and barnstormed through auditoriums and churches on both American coasts winning followers. Here was a man who stretched his wings in the winds of a nation that was open to religious innovation. It is in Neville that one finds a truly American spiritual figure: an innovator, a nonconformist, someone who dared to live by the inner light of his ideas. </p><p> THE LAW AND THE PROMISE offers testimony that "creative visualization gives birth to reality," revealing how people have used it to realize their desires.</p>Born in Barbados, West Indies, Neville came to the United States to study drama at the age of seventeen. In 1932 he gave up the theater to devote his attention to his studies in mysticism when he began his lecture career in New York City. After traveling throughout the country, he eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the late 1950 s, he gave a series of talks on television, and for many years, lectured regularly to capacity audiences at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Although Neville&#39;s career peaked in the late 1950s and early 60s, his message continues to find a place in the hearts of spiritual readers throughout the world today. Neville Goddard was one of the more quietly dramatic and supremely influential teachers in the New Thought field for many years.</p><h2>Failure to Launch: Why Your Twentysomething Hasn&#39;t Grown Up...and What to Do About It</h2><p><b>From an expert in adolescent psychology comes a groundbreaking, timely, and necessary guide for parents of the 2.2 million young adults in America who are struggling to find their way in the world.</b><br><br>In Dr. Mark McConville's decades of experience as a family clinical psychologist, perhaps no problem has been more fraught than that of young adults who fail to successfully transition from adolescence into adulthood. These kids--technically adults--just can't get it together: They can't hold a job, they struggle to develop meaningful relationships, and they often end up back in their parents' spare bedroom or on the couch. In fact, studies show that 1 in 4 Americans aged 25 to 34 neither work nor attend school, and it's a problem that spans all socioeconomic and geographic boundaries.<br><br>McConville investigates the root causes of this problem: Why are modern kids "failing to launch" in ever-increasing numbers? The key, McConville has found, is that they are struggling with three critical skills that are necessary to make the transition from childhood to adulthood--finding a sense of purpose, developing administrative responsibility, and cultivating interdependence. In Failure to Launch, McConville breaks these down into achievable, accessible goals and offers a practical guide for the whole family, to help parents instill those skills in their young adults--and to get their kids into the real world, ready to start their lives.</p><p><b>Mark McConville, Ph.D.</b>, is a clinical psychologist in private practice in Cleveland, Ohio, specializing in adult, adolescent, emerging adult, and family psychology. A senior faculty member at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland, he has lectured, published, and taught widely on the subjects of child development, parenting, and counseling methodology."Mark McConville offers a guilt-free look at why your kid is failing to launch, and explains how to tweak your parent-child interactions so that your kid becomes motivated to slide into the driver's seat of their own life.

It tells the astonishing story of sex in the West from the ancients to the moderns in a precise account of developments in reproductive anatomy and physiology. We cannot fail to recognize the players in Thomas Laqueur&#x2019;s story&#x2015;the human sexual organs and pleasures, food, blood, semen, egg, sperm&#x2015;but we will be amazed at the plots into which they have been woven by scientists, political activists, literary figures, and theorists of every stripe.</p><p>Laqueur begins with the question of why, in the late eighteenth century, woman&#x2019;s orgasm came to be regarded as irrelevant to conception, and he then proceeds to retrace the dramatic changes in Western views of sexual characteristics over two millennia. Along the way, two &#x201c;master plots&#x201d; emerge. In the one-sex story, woman is an imperfect version of man, and her anatomy and physiology are construed accordingly: the vagina is seen as an interior penis, the womb as a scrotum, the ovaries as testicles. The body is thus a representation, not the foundation, of social gender. The second plot tends to dominate post-Enlightenment thinking while the one-sex model is firmly rooted in classical learning. The two-sex story says that the body determines gender differences, that woman is the opposite of man with incommensurably different organs, functions, and feelings. The two plots overlap; neither ever holds a monopoly. Science may establish many new facts, but even so, Laqueur argues, science was only providing a new way of speaking, a rhetoric and not a key to female liberation or to social progress. <i>Making Sex</i> ends with Freud, who denied the neurological evidence to insist that, as a girl becomes a woman, the locus of her sexual pleasure shifts from the clitoris to the vagina; she becomes what culture demands despite, not because of, the body. Turning Freud&#x2019;s famous dictum around, Laqueur posits that destiny is anatomy. Sex, in other words, is an artifice.</p><p>This is a powerful story, written with verve and a keen sense of telling detail (be it technically rigorous or scabrously fanciful). <i>Making Sex</i> will stimulate thought, whether argument or surprised agreement, in a wide range of readers.</p></p><p>Thomas Laqueur is Helen Fawcett Distinguished Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;[<i>Making Sex</i> is] a brilliant documentation of difference between the one-sex and two-sex models...presenting a simple theme with broad and cascading implications... I didn&#x2019;t need Laqueur to teach me that sex was interesting, but now I have a broader base for this greatest of certainties.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen Jay Gould</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Laqueur] gives us an excellent sense of how our predecessors, including physicians and scientists, thought about the anatomy that fascinates every schoolchild... No one can doubt, after reading this book, that our notions of masculinity or femininity have been imposed on what are supposed to be objective biological observations.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Melvin Konner</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[In this] challenging analysis of our ideas on gender...Laqueur shows how radically our consciousness of ourselves, our bodies, our sex has changed over the centuries. The categories we think of as most basic turn out to be mutable...

Mackay was a penniless Irish immigrant who came of age in New York City, went to California during the Gold Rush, and mined without much luck for eight years. When he heard of riches found on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in 1859, Mackay abandoned his claim and walked a hundred miles to the Comstock Lode in Nevada.<br> <br>Over the course of the next dozen years, Mackay worked his way up from nothing, thwarting the pernicious &#x201c;Bank Ring&#x201d; monopoly to seize control of the most concentrated cache of precious metals ever found on earth, the legendary &#x201c;Big Bonanza,&#x201d; a stupendously rich body of gold and silver ore discovered 1,500 feet beneath the streets of Virginia City, the ultimate Old West boomtown.

It was the most notorious slum in the world.<br><br>The poorest and most wretched population that can be found in the world&#x2014;the scattered debris of the Irish nation.<br> <br>&#x2014;Archbishop John Hughes, 1849<br> <br>Few great men ever started further down the ladder of success than John William Mackay. He was born into dire poverty near Dublin, Ireland, on November 28, 1831. Mackay, his younger sister, and his mother and father shared a crude cottage with the family pig. That was in no way unique, for grinding need wore at the foundations of nineteenth-century Ireland. Walls of loose-stacked stone slathered in mud enclosed the one-room shelters that housed fully half the Irish population. Most didn&#x2019;t have windows. A roof of tree branches, sod, and leaky thatch protected them from the worst of the Atlantic rains; an open peat fire warmed them through the dark winter months. Beds and blankets were rare luxuries. Most Irish families slept on bare dirt floors alongside their domestic animals. A British government official reporting on the living conditions of the Irish peasantry noted that &#x201c;in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage water. . . . Pigs and manure constitute their only property.&#x201d; Like many Irish families, the Mackays didn&#x2019;t always get enough to eat.<br> <br>They were Catholic, and in the eyes of Ireland&#x2019;s Gaelic Catholic majority, theirs was a conquered country, subjugated to the foreign English crown since the mid-seventeenth century. Although Catholics constituted more than three-quarters of Ireland&#x2019;s population, by 1800, 95 percent of the country&#x2019;s land had passed into the hands of English or Anglo-Irish Protestant aristocrats. Interested only in extracting rents and raising grain and cattle for cash sale in England, those absentee owners typically spent the bounty of the Irish countryside supporting lavish lifestyles in England while the laborers and tenants who worked their estates endured desperate poverty.<br> <br>Irish tenants exchanged their labor for the lease on the small plots of dirt they needed to feed themselves. On such meager acreages, only the potato yielded sufficiently to feed a family. Poor Irish men and women ate them at almost every meal. Chronically indigent, often underfed, unable to purchase land, deprived of political power, and ferociously discriminated against for the sin of being Catholic, more than a million people left Ireland in the first four decades of the nineteenth century.<br> <br>The Mackays held firm until 1840, but when young John reached the age of nine, the family immigrated to America. In 1800, some 35,000 Irish men and women lived in the United States. When the Mackay family arrived forty years later, that number had bloated to 663,000, the overwhelming majority of them poor and barely educated. Unskilled laborers nailed to the cross of extreme poverty, most Irish male immigrants did casual day labor, taking whatever employment they could find. Ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week, they performed the brutal, backbreaking toil nobody else would do, for paltry wages, digging sewers and canals, excavating foundations, loading ships and wagons, carrying hods of bricks and mortar for skilled masons, paving streets, and building railroad beds. Irish women worked as washerwomen and domestic servants, or sewed piecework in the needle trades. Widows took in boarders and collected rags they recycled into &#x201c;shoddy,&#x201d; a cheap cloth made from shredded scraps of wool. In New York City, Irish peddlers lugged merchandise to every neighborhood, hawking sweet corn, oranges, root beer, bread, charcoal, clams, oysters, buttons, thread, fiddle strings, cigars, suspenders, and a host of other inexpensive items. Rag-clad Irish children scavenged wood, coal, scrap metal, and glass, swept street crossings for tips, shined shoes, dealt apples and individual matches, and sold newspapers.<br> <br>Rather than be grateful for their inexpensive labor and service, established Yankee Protestants despised the Irish immigrants, scorning them as &#x201c;superstitious papists&#x201d; and &#x201c;illiterate ditch diggers.&#x201d; The huge numbers of Irish-born Catholics enfranchised by the universal white male suffrage of Jacksonian democracy terrified native-born Americans. Many Protestants judged Catholicism&#x2014;with its devotion to an imagined papal dictatorship&#x2014;to be philosophically incompatible with the ideals of American democracy. Established, respectable Americans discriminated ferociously against the filthy Irish suddenly infesting the slums of eastern cities and manning the work camps of railroad- and canal-building concerns. Help wanted advertisements often carried the qualifier &#x201c;any color will answer except Irish.&#x201d; The twin millstones of being Irish and Catholic kept most Irish immigrants firmly anchored to the bottom of the American social spectrum.<br> <br>In 1840, the year the Mackay family crossed the Atlantic, nearly half of the eighty-four thousand immigrants received in the United States came from tiny Ireland, and like thousands of their countrymen, the Mackays settled in New York City. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 had transformed the city into the most important port in the Western Hemisphere. Dense forests of masts and spars sprouted from ships docked against the piers, wharfs, quays, and slips cramming the southern shores of Manhattan Island. Banking, insurance, and manufacturing industries developed alongside the trade. New York&#x2019;s population grew from 123,700 in 1820, five years before the canal opening, to 202,000 in 1830 and roughly 313,000 in 1840, making New York three times the size of Baltimore, America&#x2019;s second largest urban concentration.<br> <br>The Mackay family took quarters on Frankfort Street in the heart of the Fourth Ward. In their earliest days, the city&#x2019;s Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth wards running from the East River to the Hudson River between City Hall Park and Canal Street had housed a mixed community of free blacks and French, German, Polish, and Spanish immigrants, but as more and more people abandoned Ireland for the United States, those neighborhoods acquired a distinctly Irish flavor, an influence that spread north into the Fourteenth Ward and east to permeate the Seventh. When the Mackays arrived in 1840, the Irish presence filled much of lower Manhattan,I and it centered on the Five Points intersection, just a few hundred yards from the Mackay family&#x2019;s front door. At that time, Five Points was the most notorious slum in the United States.<br> <br>Originally, Five Points had been an attractive marshy pond, the Collect. As the city expanded, tanneries and slaughterhouses set up on its banks and dumped their effluents into the pond. The Collect grew so disgusting that it depressed local real estate values. The municipality dug a canal to drain it (and gave a name to Canal Street), and when that didn&#x2019;t improve conditions, filled in the pond. Without bedrock beneath it, the landfill proved too unstable to support major construction. Speculators bought the land and erected cheap one- to two-and-a-half-story wooden houses among the businesses of the neighborhood.<br> <br>Property owners originally designed the houses for artisans, their families, and their workshops, but as budding manufacturing industries undercut the prosperity of individual craftsmen, landlords discovered that they made much larger profits by partitioning the buildings into tiny rooms rented to immigrants. Originally known as &#x201c;tenant houses,&#x201d; the term morphed into the word &#x201c;tenements.&#x201d; The rickety wooden fabrications were damp and frigid in winter, sticky and sweltering in summer, and always choked with foul, smoky air from the fires of cooking and warming. Inside, entire families crammed into single rooms entered from dim, lightless corridors. Unceasing din harried the inhabitants. Street noise reverberated in the front rooms. Rooms in the rear filled with the sounds of neighbors facing the backyards and alleys&#x2014;spouses argued, babies screamed, siblings fought. Occupants shared filthy, overflowing outhouses with dozens of neighbors and drew water from common hydrants outside. The horses, mules, and oxen used everywhere for drayage defecated in the streets. The municipal government sponsored no garbage collection. Foot, animal, and wheeled traffic churned the improperly drained streets and alleys into fetid quagmires choked with animal corpses, human and animal waste, kitchen slops, and ashes. The stench was overwhelming.<br> <br>Mice, rats, roaches, fleas, lice, maggots, and flies thrived in the squalor. Thousands of feral pigs roamed the streets. Despite the pigs&#x2019; grotesque snouts, coarse hair, and black-splotched skin, New York residents tolerated them because the pigs were far and away the city&#x2019;s most effective street cleaners, even as they waged pitched battles with wild dogs for choice morsels of food. Among their own kind, the pigs rutted with loud, gleeful abandon. Refined Knickerbocker ladies sent up howls of protest, complaining that exposure to such indiscriminate sexual behavior undermined their respectability and lowered the moral tone of the whole city. For Irish women, most of whom had been raised in a rural countryside, fornicating domestic animals barely seemed worth a raised eyebrow. Besides, the pigs supplied valuable meat.<br> <br>The outrageous quantities of animal and human feculence contaminated local wells. Dysentery, typhoid fever, diarrhea, and other waterborne diseases wreaked far more havoc in the immigrant wards than they did in the rest of the city, as did tuberculosis, diphtheria, smallpox, measles, mental disorders, and alcoholism. Crime and prostitution were ubiquitous, murder commonplace. Astronomical mortality rates haunted New York&#x2019;s immigrant neighborhoods.<br> <br>America&#x2019;s new penny newspapers thrilled readers with lurid descriptions of the violence, dirt, mayhem, poverty, and moral depravity of Five Points. Visiting journalists could seldom resist characterizing the Irish neighborhoods as nests of vipers and sinks of filth and iniquity, unable or unwilling to do justice to the poor, working-class families who lived there. Most scribes, making brief forays into the slums, had eyes only for the dark side of the Irish wards. They failed to credit the immigrants&#x2019; ferocious struggle, or to perceive the community strength building in their churches, saloons, benevolent societies, fraternal orders, and fire companies. Immigrant families bent on improving their lot in the new country fought a constant battle to maintain any semblance of dignity in the face of such filth, squalor, and anarchic ruckus. The vast majority of Irish immigrants worked as hard as humanly possible to better their lives and the lives of their children as they fought to claw their way up from circumstances so desperate they were difficult for established Yankees to comprehend.<br> <br>Among the thousands of immigrant families in New York City, the Mackays struggled forward in anonymity, and for their first two years in the United States, the family did reasonably well. Mr. and Mrs. Mackay scraped together enough money to send their ten-year-old son to school. In that, John Mackay was lucky. Only about half the school-age Irish children then living in New York City received any education at all.<br> <br>Disaster struck the family in 1842. John Mackay&#x2019;s father died of a cause lost to history. The catastrophe forced eleven-year-old John Mackay to quit school and work to support his mother and sister. Mackay could read, write, and figure, but he would never receive another day of classroom schooling. A taciturn lad who spoke slowly and awkwardly, fighting a stutter, he&#x2019;d regret his lack of formal education for the rest of his life.<br> <br>In an age devoid of social safety nets, when circumstances forced Irish boys not yet old enough to apprentice to earn money to help their family survive, most of them started selling newspapers or shining shoes. No resident of Frankfort Street would have been surprised that John Mackay fell into the world of the New York newsboys after his father&#x2019;s death&#x2014;most of the city&#x2019;s newspapers had their headquarters on Park Row a few blocks west of the Mackay family lodgings.<br> <br>For a job so near the bottom of the capitalist ladder, selling newspapers forced the young boys to accept a whopping ton of risk. Most New York dailies sold for two cents, and newsboys made a half-cent profit on every sale. However, wholesalers forced the newsboys to purchase their supply outright, for 1.5 cents per paper, and the newsboys couldn&#x2019;t return unsold stock. Any newspapers they didn&#x2019;t sell therefore cut a significant chunk from their earnings. The newsboys called it &#x201c;getting stuck,&#x201d; and they hated it. The more fortunate ones, like John Mackay, knew how to read, since basic literacy conveyed a major selling advantage. A literate newsboy could scan the leading stories and make a snap judgment about how many papers he&#x2019;d sell. Ones who couldn&#x2019;t read had to find a trusted ally to perform the service.<br> <br>Newsboys bought their stock of morning papers before sunrise and immediately hit the streets crying the headlines, their clear, young voices among the all-pervasive sounds of the New York streets. Astute newsboys tailored their cries to their intended marks, touting commercial news at the approach of a Wall Street sharp or social happenings to a fashionable lady, and they all led a rough-and-tumble territorial existence. Newsboys staked claims to the best street corners and selling locales and fiercely defended their fiefdoms against interlopers. Fistfights were common, and John Mackay both received and administered his fair share of thrashings.<br> <br>Midmorning, newsboys who had exhausted their stock grabbed a bite to eat and then hustled odd jobs&#x2014;perhaps sweeping street crossings or carrying packages for tips at a ferry terminal&#x2014;until the late papers dropped in the afternoon. They&#x2019;d repeat their selling routine into the evening. An average newsboy, on an average day, earned twenty-five to fifty cents. A good salesman, on a good day, hustling hard until he&#x2019;d sold his last paper, took home between sixty cents and a dollar. A day with incendiary headlines might earn a newsboy as much as two dollars.<br> <br>Selling newspapers was an endless grind, but the newsboys reveled in their self-sufficient autonomy and liberty. Each boy worked on his own account, suffering no boss. Off-duty, they crowded the rowdy galleries of the Bowery and Chatham theaters, notorious aficionados of low entertainments and equally ardent spectators at prizefights and cockfights.

The man he thought the greatest in the world was innovative newsman James Gordon Bennett, founder and owner of the New York Herald, a Scottish immigrant whom Mackay often watched hustle through City Hall Square with a bundle of newspapers tucked under his arm.

But his impact reached beyond France&#x2019;s borders as well. His legacy of war, civil rights, exploitation, and national awakening reshaped identities across the European continent, while in the Atlantic world he destroyed the colonial order and helped plant the seeds of American power.

Martin Beck and his colleagues feverishly comb Stockholm for the murderer, a demented and deadly rifleman, who has plans for even more chaos. As the tension builds and a feeling of imminent danger grips Beck, his investigation unearths evidence of police corruption. That&#x2019;s when an even stronger sense of responsibility and something like shame urge him into taking a series of drastic steps, which lead to a shocking disaster.</p><p><b>Maj Sj�wall </b>and <b>Per Wahl��</b>, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. Mr Wahl��, who died in 1975, was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories, and novels. Maj Sj�wall is also a poet.The violent killing of a Swedish police captain while in hospital brings to light the brutality of his 40 years on the Stockholm police force. His history leaves Detective Martin Beck and his colleagues with plenty of suspects. Tom Weiner perfects the gravelly rumble of the hard-boiled but intellectual Beck as he makes his way through the dangerous case. Sj�wall&#39;s and Wahl��&#39;s descriptive prose, in tandem with Weiner&#39;s narration, enlivens the Scandinavian imagery, as well as the characters&#39; often-sordid surroundings. Scrutiny of modern law enforcement, with a strong indictment of indiscriminate brutality, flows throughout as a social theme. Gripping tension leads to a bleak and horrifying disaster but leaves us awaiting more from this crime series.

Then, slowly, a mist settled deep inside the mind she once knew so well, blurring the world around her. She didn&#x2019;t know it then, but dementia was starting to take hold. In 2014, at age fifty-eight, she was diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer&#x2019;s.&nbsp;<br><br> In this groundbreaking book, Mitchell shares the heartrending story of her cognitive decline and how she has fought to stave it off. What lay ahead of her after the diagnosis was scary and unknowable, but Mitchell was determined and resourceful, and she vowed to outwit the disease for as long as she could.<br><br> As Mitchell learned to embrace her new life, she began to see her condition as a gift, a chance to experience the world with fresh eyes and to find her own way to make a difference. Even now, her sunny outlook persists: She devotes her time to educating doctors, caregivers, and other people living with dementia, helping to reduce the stigma surrounding this insidious disease.<br><br> Still living independently, Mitchell now uses Post-it notes and technology to remind her of her routines and has created a &#x201c;memory room&#x201d; where she displays photos&#x2014;with labels&#x2014;of her daughters, friends, and special places. It is a room where she feels calm and happy, especially on days when the mist descends.<br><br> A chronicle of one woman&#x2019;s struggle to make sense of her shifting world and her mortality, <i>Somebody I Used to Know</i> offers a powerful rumination on memory, perception, and the simple pleasure of living in the moment. Philosophical, poetic, intensely personal, and ultimately hopeful, this moving memoir<i> </i>is both a tribute to the woman Wendy Mitchell used to be and a brave affirmation of the woman she has become.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Somebody I Used to Know</i></b><br><b><br></b>&#x201c;Remarkable . . .

She continued to work as an administrator for the British National Health Service until March 2015, when she retired to live &#x201c;happily alone.&#x201d; She now writes a popular blog about the experience of living with early-onset dementia called &#x201c;Which me am I today?&#x201d; She has been profiled on BBC news, and for two awareness-raising videos, one for the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Society in the UK and one by <i>Women &amp; Home</i> magazine. The single mother of two adult daughters, she lives in Yorkshire, England.It happened again the other day. This was nothing like before. It was much, much worse. It wasn&#x2019;t a word lost from the tip of my tongue; it wasn&#x2019;t an absent adjective, a vanished verb. It wasn&#x2019;t getting up from the sofa and padding into the kitchen in slippers, then forgetting to bring back the cup of tea I&#x2019;d just poured myself. It wasn&#x2019;t running upstairs for something and then reaching the top step and not for the life of me remembering what it might be.<br><br>This was totally different. This was totally blank.<br><br>A<br><br>big<br><br>dark<br><br>black<br><br>hole.<br><br>And the worse thing was, just when I needed you most, you were gone.<br><br>I am running along the path by the river with an impending sense of something I can&#x2019;t put my finger on. It has lingered for a few weeks now. More honestly, a few months. How can I describe it? Perhaps that in itself is why I haven&#x2019;t been to the doctor&#x2019;s, why I haven&#x2019;t mentioned it to anyone else, not even my daughters. How are you meant to describe these things? My head feels fuzzy, life is a little less sharp. What use would that generic description be? It would be better not to waste my GP&#x2019;s time, and yet I know there&#x2019;s something, an inkling that I am functioning around average. Even though I know that what I consider to be average would be above average for most people, this just isn&#x2019;t me.<br><br>It was this fuzziness that had pulled me from the sofa this afternoon, that pushed my feet into my running shoes, that placed my house keys into one hand, my iPod into another. I wasn&#x2019;t sure where I&#x2019;d get the energy to run, but I knew I&#x2019;d find it: I&#x2019;d push through that initial wall, just as I had dozens of times before, and the next time I open the front door of my riverside apartment it would be with adrenalin pumping through my veins, I&#x2019;d feel invigorated. That&#x2019;s what a run had always done.<br><br>I glance down at my feet doing their job, finding the pace the way they always did, the rhythm, the gentle thud as I hit the concrete, and I look up again at the path, waiting for the world to sharpen into focus just as it always had. &#x201c;Five hundred meters,&#x201d; the robotic voice in my headphones announces, my iPod synced up to my shoes, motivation to push me through, and yet right now, it feels more like a marker of failure. I&#x2019;ve done more than this. I tackled the Three Peaks Challenge last year and I can still conjure up the feeling I had when I reached the top of the first peak, Pen-y-ghent, more than 2,000 feet above sea level; it felt like I&#x2019;d conquered the world. The same adrenalin I now desperately awaited had pushed blood around my body to tackle two more peaks on the same day, the wind blowing hard in my ears at the top. Life wasn&#x2019;t fuzzy around the edges then; it was pin-sharp.<br><br>It&#x2019;s cold and crisp and my running leggings hug my thighs, keeping the warmth of my body trapped inside. Aside from the sound of my rubber soles hitting the path, the only other sound is the swish of oars breaking the stillness of the river as the scullers practice their skills between bridges. Down one side of the river I&#x2019;ll go, crossing the Millennium Bridge, back up the other side, a route I have trodden so many times before. But then, in a second, everything changes. Without warning, I&#x2019;m falling. There&#x2019;s no time to even put my hands out toward the concrete as it comes crashing toward me. My face hits the ground first; white pain shoots through my nose, my cheekbones; I feel a crack. Something hot and sticky bursts from within. It&#x2019;s a couple of seconds before there is complete stillness. I use it to catch my breath and when I reach up to my face my hand returns to me covered in blood. That&#x2019;s when the pain hits, not just physical pain, but the sting of humiliation as I look down at my legs, a tangle in front of me, and for that split second I don&#x2019;t recognize them or what they&#x2019;ve done to me. Or, rather, what they&#x2019;ve allowed to happen. I&#x2019;ve broken my nose, I&#x2019;m sure of it. I stagger to my feet, blood soaking my running top, seeping into each thread of the fabric. Helpless to stop the stain spreading further across my chest, I stumble back toward home.<br><br>My doctor&#x2019;s office is just around the corner, and so I decide to walk there and see the nurse. The shock is settling into my bones now, and by the time I stand in front of her, my hands are shaking. My knees are doing the same, and I&#x2019;m hoping that she hasn&#x2019;t noticed.<br><br>She sends me straight to Emergency and on the walk there, I&#x2019;m still trying to work out what went wrong, whether it was anything to do with that sense of something I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on when I set off. Was that it? Was that what I was waiting for? A fall while I was running? But somehow it feels bigger than that. I wait in Emergency, the blood drying brown on my running top, tissues speckled scarlet scrunched tight inside my palm, telling myself that this is a one-off, and then finally I&#x2019;m called in to see the nurse who will patch me up.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s nothing broken,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky. How did it happen?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I was out running.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, the perils of running,&#x201d; she laughs. &#x201c;I know them well!&#x201d;<br><br>We share the joke, rolling our eyes, but it&#x2019;s there again, that sense of something more. I&#x2019;m already planning to go back along the route on my way home, to find the wonky paving slab that has left me with two black eyes, yet thankfully, no broken bones. I&#x2019;m grateful that I&#x2019;m on annual vacation, that I don&#x2019;t need to walk into the office tomorrow with black and purple patterns stretched across my face.<br><br>An hour later I&#x2019;m standing in front of the place where I fell. It&#x2019;s easily recognizable from the spatter of red where my face hit the pavement. I search all around, but there is no dip in the pavement, no loose slab, nothing to trip over. So what was it, then? The fog in my head makes it hard to decipher&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing, no clues&#x2014;but this has never happened before. I return home and lie back into the sofa cushions, battered and bruised, back where I was before, looking out at the River Ouse as the sky darkens above it and the mystery deepens beneath. I&#x2019;m tired now, more tired than before. It hurts to close my eyes, but this time I let the lethargy cover me like a blanket, and for the first time, I don&#x2019;t attempt to fight it.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a few days later, and I book an appointment with my General Practitioner, the tiredness dragging me there rather than anything else. My lack of energy: that&#x2019;s how it started.<br><br>I sit in front of him. &#x201c;I just . . . I just feel slower than usual,&#x201d; I say, and he studies me for a second or two.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been entertaining silly thoughts. One that passed through quickly was a brain tumor. I study the doctor&#x2019;s face to see if he&#x2019;s thinking the same, but he gives away no clues. Instead, his shoulders slump away from his ears and he attempts an expression of something like empathy.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fit, you exercise, you eat well, you don&#x2019;t smoke and at fifty-six, you&#x2019;re relatively young,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;But there comes a time when we all have to admit to ourselves that we&#x2019;re just slowing down.&#x201d;<br><br>He sits back in his chair then and folds his arms, waiting for it to sink in.<br><br>&#x201c;You work hard, Wendy,&#x201d; he sighs. &#x201c;Maybe take some time off.&#x201d;<br><br>I want to tell him that I have done, that right now I&#x2019;m in the middle of annual leave and the idea of taking any more than that is preposterous to someone like me. I&#x2019;m the person at work who knows the system for rostering nursing shifts inside out. I&#x2019;m the one my colleagues nickname &#x201c;the guru&#x201d; because my recall is so sharp, because I can problem-solve in a second, reminding anyone who asks who works night shifts, who needs which day off. They can&#x2019;t possibly manage without me. But he&#x2019;s tidying papers on his desk and I sense this is the end of the appointment.<br><br>&#x201c;Age.&#x201d; He shrugs when he turns back and finds me staring at him.<br><br>I leave his office. I know I should be feeling relieved. My doctor isn&#x2019;t worried, it seems, and normally I would distract myself with work, throwing myself back into the job I love, yet I go home to an empty flat. I don&#x2019;t tell my daughters Gemma or Sarah about the fall. I tell myself the doctor is right, that it is nothing but age, but more months go by and the snowdrift that seems to have settled in my mind remains, along with the lack of energy and the same feeling I just can&#x2019;t put my finger on. There are other things too; a forgetfulness. I go on other runs and I always get to the same spot, the place where I fell, and check the pavement every time, searching for signs of why, but deep down I know it was me.<br><br>And then it happens again. I&#x2019;m out running, crossing a road, convinced that I can get ahead of the car that&#x2019;s about to turn left across my path. I see it coming and suddenly decide to dodge it, but something is lost, some message between my brain and my legs fails to get through fast enough, and instead I stumble, falling flat onto the pavement again, this time thankfully bruising nothing more than my ego.<br><br>There are three of those falls in quick succession. The last time I land badly on my hand, and that afternoon, when I put my runnning shoes away, something tells me it&#x2019;s for the last time. My brain and legs aren&#x2019;t talking to each other; the communication is lost. I go back to the doctor and there a nurse pulls blood from my veins into vials and sends them off.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything is clear,&#x201d; my GP tells me when I go back for the results, and again he mentions my age. I sit in front of him, unsure how to explain that everything is getting slower, that on bad days my mind can&#x2019;t instantly recall names and faces and places like it used to. Perhaps he is right and it is age, but I leave the office again with that impending sense of something I can&#x2019;t put my finger on, a sense that the doctor is missing something and yet I can&#x2019;t form enough thoughts to give him a clue as to what.<br><br>I remember the frantic pace, the speed with which you tackled things. I secretly admired that, even though I never would have said it. You drove everywhere, up and down the country all the time for work. On holidays you&#x2019;d walk for miles across fells in the Lake District, right into the middle of nowhere, never minding if you got lost, because if you did, you had your wits about you&#x2014;you would see distant landmarks, familiar sights, and simply follow your nose. I couldn&#x2019;t do that. Not now.<br><br>We wouldn&#x2019;t get on now, you and I. Too much time has passed. We are friends who have lost touch, who now lead parallel lives. We like different things. You love the hustle and bustle of a busy city, whereas some days I lose hours just looking out of a window at the view. Just looking. Just still. And silent. But you always liked to be doing things, always wanted to be busy. You were never any good at just sitting. I have a lovely view where I live now. It&#x2019;s in a village not far from Beverley, East Yorkshire. Actually, you might remember&#x2014;it&#x2019;s where Gemma lived. You fell in love with it too when we first came to visit, pointing out all the pretty red-brick cottages that line the street. You loved the friendly atmosphere, the fact everyone you met said hello whether they knew you or not. I do remember some things, like her showing you around the house, giving the guided tour, room to room, up and down stairs. You dutifully followed, excited too. Only she would have recognized that glint in your eye, that longing inside to roll your sleeves up and get stuck in, to open cans of paint and start decorating there and then. Nothing fazed you.<br><br>I am sitting in another hospital waiting room, with an overnight bag at my side purely as a precaution, or at least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve told my eldest daughter, Sarah, because I don&#x2019;t want her to worry. It had been the GP&#x2019;s idea to call one of my daughters when he handed me the referral letter, telling me to head straight to casualty. When I had phoned Sarah I&#x2019;d promised there was nothing to panic about, that they would just need to check me over, that it would be nothing, although I&#x2019;m not sure which one of us I was trying to convince. The sensation of a head half-filled with cotton wool has continued for months&#x2014;since the last fall&#x2014;and this weekend it has been much, much worse. A fatigue that I couldn&#x2019;t fathom. My fork slipping from my hand, clattering onto my plate into my dinner. When I got to work on Monday, my colleague noticed how my words slurred from my mouth, and she&#x2019;d sent me home. It was clear that this was something much more serious than simply burning the candle at both ends. And now I&#x2019;m here, sitting side by side with Sarah on the hard plastic hospital benches, looking out at the scene unfolding in front of us.<br><br>Sarah is still in the throes of her nursing training and her newly acquired medical eye roams over each patient as the pair of us observe other bodies in the room; the crude slings, the blood-soaked tea towels grabbed hurriedly, toddlers impatient to wait their turn, and the mothers trying hard to disguise their worry from them. The referral letter in my hand feels damp beneath my touch. When I&#x2019;d shown it to the nurse who assessed me on arrival, I&#x2019;d been surprised that she&#x2019;d recognized my name as a patient, that the GP had already phoned ahead. Despite the fact that I knew the drill, that I work in hospitals, I didn&#x2019;t expect it to be happening to me.<br><br>They want to keep me in for monitoring. They&#x2019;re not sure what&#x2019;s to blame for the slurring, or at least even if they are, they haven&#x2019;t said. I&#x2019;m sent back to the plastic chairs while I wait for a bed, and it&#x2019;s then that I convince Sarah not to wait with me.<br><br>&#x201c;It could be hours yet,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point in us both sitting here.&#x201d;<br><br>I see the doubt in her eyes, but she finally gathers up her coat and bag, and I promise to call her as soon as there is any news.<br><br>I was right to make her leave because it is hours later that they find me a bed. Darkness hangs outside at the windows as I&#x2019;m led up to the ward. I lie on top of the sheets, still in the work clothes I&#x2019;d dressed myself in that morning. All around me, nurses flit back and forth, never enough time between beds and patients, time flying on their shift, where for me it drags painfully. Ironically, I hate hospitals. I know I make a terrible patient. There&#x2019;s an electronic roster on the screen I can just make out from my bed and the nurses who buzz around have no idea that I can read from it just how understaffed they are, that I know whose feet are tired from the day shift, who&#x2019;s just arrived for the night. There&#x2019;s nothing to do but stare at the screen between checks until a nurse arrives to assess me more thoroughly.<br><br>&#x201c;How long has your speech been affected?&#x201d; she asks.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it was until this morning,&#x201d; I tell her, as she takes a pen from her pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you pull me toward you?&#x201d; she says, taking my weaker left arm in hers. I sense in her eyes that my arm is refusing to obey a simple test.<br><br>&#x201c;OK, now push me away,&#x201d; she says. The same again; she scribbles something on my notes, then leaves my bedside. I&#x2019;m lucky tonight. They&#x2019;ve put me into a side room, nothing to watch except different shades of blue as nurses hurry between beds outside. I slip into my pajamas, but I don&#x2019;t sleep, the strange sounds from the machines I&#x2019;m wired up to providing an unfamiliar soundtrack. Each time I feel my body relax, attempting to sink further into an unyielding mattress, an alarm goes off as my heart rate dips, a nurse rushes in and checks the screen, but I don&#x2019;t panic. I have a low resting heart rate; I&#x2019;m fit and healthy. Aren&#x2019;t I?</p><h2>The Brave</h2><p><p><b></b></p><b>Sonny's been an outsider all his life. </b><p></p><p>He has never fit into either world: the Moscondagas on the Reservation see him as white; whites see him as Indian. So far, Sonny's managed to harness his anger -- what he calls "the monster" -- in the boxing ring. But Sonny wants out of the Res. He's headed for New York City, where nobody can tell him what to do.</p><p>Sonny doesn't count on stepping into the middle of a drug war when he gets there -- or on tangling with a tough Harlem boxer-turned-cop named Alfred Brooks. Brooks seems to think that Sonny's got the talent to make it to the top -- to be a contender. But first Sonny's got to learn to be smart, take control of his life, and beat the monster. Only it isn't as easy as it sounds....</p></p><p><p>Robert Lipsyte was an award-winning sportswriter for the <em>New York Times</em> and the Emmy-winning host of the nightly public affairs show <em>The Eleventh Hour</em>. He is the author of twelve acclaimed novels for young adults and is the recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards Award honoring his lifetime contribution in that genre. He lives in Manhattan and on Shelter Island, New York, with his wife, Lois, and his dog, Milo.</p>Alfred Brooks, hero of The Contender (1967), reappears as a police sergeant who rescues a young Native American boxer from drug pushers. Sonny Bear, 17, steps off the bus in N.Y.C., accepts a job with a hustler (``Stick''), and is immediately busted for possession. Sonny has talent, but he's hot-tempered and undisciplined; he's nearly killed in the correctional facility before Brooks springs him and sends him to Donatelli's Gym, the place in Harlem where world champions, and Brooks himself, once trained. Characters here may sneer at Rocky and The Karate Kid, but the story has elements of both. Sonny's training begins on the reservation, where it's supplied by old Jake Stump, member of a secret society (the ``Running Braves''); after a brief course of instruction at Donatelli's, the youth enters a citywide amateur competition and rips his way to the finals. His triumph is followed by a double blow: Brooks is shot and paralyzed (in a dramatic climax, Sonny tracks down the suspect--Stick); and Sonny is stripped of his amateur status when it comes out that he was paid for some previous bouts. A gritty tale of a young man who learns to replace his anger with pride. Well-written boxing action, too. (Fiction. 12-15) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this classic account, he dramatically details how the tides of despair and triumph flowed and ebbed as the political and military leaders of the time navigated the dangerous currents of world conflict.<br><br>Churchill vividly recounts the major campaigns that shaped the war: the furious attacks of the Marne, the naval maneuvers off Jutland, Verdun's &#x201c;soul-stirring frenzy,&#x201d; and the surprising victory of Chemins des Dames. Here, too, he re-creates the dawn of modern warfare: the buzz of airplanes overhead, trench combat, artillery thunder, and the threat of chemical warfare. In Churchill's inimitable voice we hear how &#x201c;the war to end all wars&#x201d; instead gave birth to every war that would follow, including the current war in Iraq. Written with unprecedented flair and knowledge of the events, <i>The World Crisis</i> remains the single greatest history of World War I, essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the twentieth century.</p><p>Churchill&#39;s history of The Great War reaches 1915 - the year of stalemate on the Western Front and the first uses of tank and gas warfare on the battlefield, as well as Churchill&#39;s own involvement in the Gallipoli campaign.Winston Churchill (1874&#x2013;1965) was prime minister of Great Britain from 1940&#x2013;1945 and 1951&#x2013;1955.

Finally available in English, it is an unrivaled example of Panofsky's early method that placed him within broader developments in theories of knowledge and cultural change. Here, drawing on a massive body of learning that ranges over Antique philosophy, theology, science, and optics as well as the history of art, Panofsky produces a type of "archaeology" of Western representation that far surpasses the usual scope of art historical studies. Perspective in Panofsky's hands becomes a central component of a Western "will to form," the expression of a schema linking the social, cognitive, psychological, and especially technical practices of a given culture into harmonious and integrated wholes. Yet the perceptual schema of each historical culture or epoch is different, and each gives rise to a different but equally full vision of the world. Panofsky articulates these different spatial systems, demonstrating their particular coherence and compatibility with the modes of knowledge, belief, and exchange that characterized the cultures in which they arose. Our own modernity, Panofsky shows, is characterized by its peculiarly mathematical expression of the concept of the infinite, within a space that is necessarily both continuous and homogeneous.</p></p><p>Christopher S.

This remarkable "critique of critique" is introduced here without embellishment, cutting straight to the heart of the matter in a particularly clear and logical manner. It allows the destiny of thought to be the absolute once more.</i></p><p>"This work is one of the most important to appear in continental philosophy in recent years and deserves a wide readership at the earliest possible date ... <i>Apr�s </i><i>la finitude </i>is an important book of philosophy by an authnted emerging voices in continental thought. Quentin Meillassoux deserves our close attention in the years to come and his book deserves rapid translation and widespread discussion in the English-speaking world. There is nothing like it."</p><p><i>-</i>Graham Harman in <i>Philosophy Today</i></p><p>Quentin Meillassoux's remarkable debut makes a strikingly original contribution to contemporary French philosophy and is set to have a significant impact on the future of continental philosophy. Written in a style that marries great clarity of expression with argumentative rigour, <i>After Finitude </i>provides bold readings of the history of philosophy and sets out a devastating critique of the unavowed fideism at the heart of post-Kantian philosophy. </p><p>The exceptional lucidity and the centrality of argument in Meillassoux's writing should appeal to analytic as well as continental philosophers, while his critique of fideism will be of interest to anyone preoccupied by the relation between philosophy, theology and religion. </p><p>Meillassoux introduces a startlingly novel philosophical alternative to the forced choice between dogmatism and critique. <i>After Finitude </i>proposes a new alliance between philosophy and science and calls for an unequivocal halt to the creeping return of religiosity in contemporary philosophical discourse.</p></p><p>Ray Brassier is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon.<p>'Rarely do we encounter a book which not only meets the highest standards of thinking, but sets up itself new standards, transforming the entire field into which it intervenes. Quentin Meillassoux does exactly this.' Slavoj Zizek</p><br><br>'In his clearly argued essay, now available in an excellent English translation, the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux shows that subjectivity and objectivity must be conceived of independently of each other ... It is a truly philosophical work in that it develops the original idea of a speculative materialism with uncompromising passion and great consistency.'Alexander Garcia D�ttmann, Professor of Philosophy and Visual Culture, Goldsmiths University of London, UK<br><br>'You may entirely disagree with the author's solution (I do) but not with the courage with which he proposes to escape from the prison of discourse and to put the much abused metaphor of the Copernican Revolution right at last.'Bruno Latour<br><br>"Talented and exciting new voice in contemporary French philosophy"&#x2014;Bookseller Buyers Guide (Bookseller Buyers Guide)<br><br>'An exceptionally clear and careful writer... Quentin Meillassoux launches a stinging attack upon the state of philosophy in general, and takes initial steps towards a form of speculative philosophy which, he thinks, overcomes the shortcomings he has identified.' - John Appleby, The Philosopher's Magazine, Issue 43, 4th Quarter 2008<br><br>"It's easy to see why Meillassoux's <em>After Finitude</em> has so quickly acquired something of a cult status among some readers who share his lack of reverance for 'the way things are'. The book is exceptionally clear and concise, entirely devoted to a single chain of reasoning. It combines a confident insitence on the self-sufficiency of rational demonstration with an equally rationalist suspicion of mere experience and consensus....[this] is a beautifully written and seductively argued book." - Peter Hallward, <em>Radical Philosophy</em>, 2008<br><br>"<em>After Finitude</em> will certainly play a central role in ongoing debates on the status of philosophy, on questions pertaining to epistemology and, above all, to ontology. It will not only be an unavoidable point of reference for those working on the question of finitude, but also for those whose work deals with political theology, and the status of the religious turn of philosophy. After <em>Finitude</em> will certainly become an ideal corrosive against too rigid assumptions and will shake entrenched positions." &#x2014; Gabriel Riera, University of Illinois, Chicago, in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, 2008<br><br>"There is something absolutely exhilarating about Meillassoux's argument, and it is not difficult to see why his book has already aroused so much interest. The exposition and critique of correlationism is brilliant and Meillassoux is at his best when showing the philosophical complacency of contemporary Kantians and phenomenologists. The proposal of speculative realism is audacious and bracing, particularly when he defends the idea of nature as a 'glacial universe', cold and indeifferent to humans. Such is Pascal's 'Eternal silence of infinite spaces', but without the consolation of a wager of God's existence. However, by Mellassoux's own admission, his proposal is incomplete and we await its elaboration in future books. Although, his style of presentation can turn into a sort of fine-grained logic-chopping worthy of Duns Scotus, the rigour, clarity and passion of the argument can be breathtaking." &#x2014; Simon Critchley, TLS, Feb 2009<br><br><p>"Meillassoux addresses the question whether natural laws are necessary, and if so why, raised by Kant and gnawed by subsequent philosophers from Hume to Foucault. He offers a logical proof that the only feature of the laws of nature that is absolutely necessary is that they are contingent. He explores the ethical and metaphysical implications. Brassier translates <em>Apres la finitude</em>, which was published in 2006 by Editions du Seuil." -Eithne O'Leyne, <em>BOOK NEWS, Inc.</em></p><br><br>'A penetrating critique of the post-Kantian "correlationism" that has dominated philosophy on the European mainland over the last 250 years.' - Books of the Year, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em></p><h2>Mastering Sauces: The Home Cook&#x2019;s Guide to New Techniques for Fresh Flavors</h2><p><p><strong>The definitive cookbook on contemporary sauces that highlights fresh flavors and updated classics.</strong></p><p>Finally, a cookbook on sauces that is fresh, vibrant, and alive.

Of her own work, she wrote: &#x201c;What I do in writing of any character is to try to enter into the mind, heart, and skin of a human being who is not myself. Whether this happens to be a man or a woman, old or young, with skin black or white, the primary challenge lies in making the jump itself. It is the act of a writer&#x2019;s imagination that I set most high.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Stories, Essays and Memoir</i>&nbsp;presents Welty&#x2019;s collected short stories, an astonishing body of work that has made her one of the most respected writers of short fiction.&nbsp;<i>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</i>&nbsp;(1941), her first book, includes many of her most popular stories, such as &#x201c;A Worn Path.&#x201d; &#x201c;Powerhouse,&#x201d; and the farcical &#x201c;Why I Live at the P.O.&#x201d;<br><i><br>The Wide Net and Other Stories</i>&nbsp;(1943), in which historical figures such as Aaron Burr (&#x201c;First Love&#x201d;) and John James Audubon (&#x201c;A Still Moment&#x201d;) appear as characters, shows her evolving mastery as a regional chronicler.<br><i><br>The Golden Apples</i>&nbsp;(1946) is a series of interrelated stories about the inhabitants of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi. It was Welty&#x2019;s favorite among her books, and she described it as &#x201c;an experience in a writer&#x2019;s own discovery of affinities. In writing, as in life, the connections of all sorts of relationships and kinds lie in wait of discovery, and give out their signals to the Geiger counter of the charged imagination, once it is drawn into the right field.&#x201d;<br><br>The stories of&nbsp;<i>The Bride of Innisfallen and Other Stories</i>&nbsp;(1955) are set both in the American South and in Europe.

The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p>It's small wonder that the Library of America chose Eudora Welty as the first living (at that time) author published in this prestigious series. Welty was the kind of writer people routinely call "an American institution." But don't let the sweet white-haired-old-lady image fool you: Welty's work is anything but benign. For more than 50 years, Welty spoke with a fierce and uncompromising literary voice. Or, rather, <i>voices</i>: the stories collected in this volume feature a dizzying array of characters, each of whom seems to whisper directly into the reader's ear. From the toxic rage of "Where Is the Voice Coming From?" to the jazzy rhythms of "Powerhouse," these tales blaze with intensity and a comic energy that's both gentle and fierce. Even that bane of junior-high-school speech tournaments everywhere, "Why I Live at the P.O.," benefits from rereading; as far as this brand of down-home farce goes, Welty does it better than anyone. Bringing together the contents of Welty's four short-fiction collections, this Library of America volume also includes several essays as well as Welty's very fine 1984 memoir, "One Writer's Beginnings." In it she speaks of connections, continuities, the way both her fiction and her experiences emerged gradually into focus over time: <blockquote>...suddenly a light is thrown back, as when your train makes a curve, showing that there has been a mountain of meaning rising behind you on the way you've come, is rising there still, proven now through retrospect.</blockquote> This volume is that light thrown back; the full import of Welty's enormously influential work is perhaps apparent only now, in this substantial and rewarding retrospective of her career. <i>--Mary Park</i><b>Eudora Welty</b> (1909-2001) was the author of novels, short stories, memoirs, and essays, including such celebrated works as <i>The Optimist's Daughter</i>, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1973.

As he plans his picture, he contemplates the lives of all the people he has ever known there.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.<br></i>Written for J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s own children, <i>The Hobbit</i> met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001). Unforgettable! <br></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><b>Scenes from <em>The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies</em></b></p> <em> </em> Luke Evans as Bard and Orlando Bloom as Legolas in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, in theatres December 17, 2014.

Refreshingly, in this wide-ranging discussion of the moral and political status of homosexuals, Sullivan, the gay former whizbang <i>New Republic</i> editor, prefers the middle register. On the one hand, he shuns the liberal tendency to give gays victim status but, on the other, advocates the legalization of gay marriage because he views it as the public recognition of a gay's basic human right to fully love another member of his/her group -- a right that, Sullivan notes, even bigots generally grant those they hate."Virtually Normal is a brilliant and revolutionary book that will transform gay studies." --Camille Paglia, Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Groundbreaking. . . .

Based on proven theories outlined in Christensen&#39;s landmark books The Innovator&#39;s Dilemma and The Innovator&#39;s Solution, Seeing What&#39;s Next offers a practical, three-part model that helps decision-makers spot the signals of industry change, determine the outcome of competitive battles, and assess whether a firm&#39;s actions will ensure or threaten future success. Through in-depth case studies of industries from aviation to health care, the authors illustrate the predictive power of innovation theory in action.</p><p><b>Christensen</b> is one of the brightest stars in business right now, and is recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on innovation.

Published in 1923, it has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American editions alone have sold more than nine million copies.<br><i><br>The Prophet </i>is a collection of poetic essays that are philosophical, spiritual, and, above all, inspirational. Gibran&#x2019;s musings are divided into twenty-eight chapters covering such sprawling topics as love, marriage, children, giving, eating and drinking, work, joy and sorrow, housing, clothes, buying and selling, crime and punishment, laws, freedom, reason and passion, pain, self-knowledge, teaching, friendship, talking, time, good and evil, prayer, pleasure, beauty, religion, and death.<br><br>Each essay reveals deep insights into the impulses of the human heart and mind. The <i>Chicago Post </i>said of <i>The Prophet</i>: &#x201c;Cadenced and vibrant with feeling, the words of Kahlil Gibran bring to one&#x2019;s ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes . . . If there is a man or woman who can read this book without a quiet acceptance of a great man&#x2019;s philosophy and a singing in the heart as of music born within, that man or woman is indeed dead to life and truth.&#x201d;<br><br>With twelve full-page drawings by Gibran, this beautiful work makes an incredible gift for anyone seeking enlightenment and inspiration.</p><p>In a distant, timeless place, a mysterious prophet walks the sands. At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the man's wisdom is his gift. It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired." Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>A brilliant man&#39;s philosophy on love, marriage, joy and sorrow, time, friendship and much more.

Enchanted by their way of life, he falls in love with a local girl and starts to distrust his masters. Discovering their man has gone native, they in turn resolve to destroy both him and the native population once and for all.</p> <p><i>Avatar</i> or <i>Pocahontas</i>? As stories they&#x2019;re almost identical. Some have even accused James Cameron of stealing the Native American myth.1 But it&#x2019;s both simpler and more complex than that, for the underlying structure is common not only to these two tales, but to all.</p> <p>Take three different stories:</p> <p></p> <p>A dangerous monster threatens a community. One man takes it on himself to kill the beast and restore happiness to the kingdom &#x2026;</p> <p></p> <p>It&#x2019;s the story of <i>Jaws</i>, released in 1976. But it&#x2019;s also the story of <i>Beowulf</i>, the Anglo-Saxon epic poem published some time between the eighth and eleventh centuries.</p> <p>And it&#x2019;s more familiar than that: it&#x2019;s <i>The Thing</i>, it&#x2019;s <i>Jurassic Park</i>, it&#x2019;s <i>Godzilla</i>, it&#x2019;s <i>The Blob</i> &#x2013; all films with real tangible monsters. If you recast the monsters in human form, it&#x2019;s also every James Bond film, every episode of <i>MI5</i>, <i>House</i> or <i>CSI</i>. You can see the same shape in <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Fatal Attraction</i>, <i>Scream</i>, <i>Psycho</i> and <i>Saw</i>. The monster may change from a literal one in <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i> to a corporation in <i>Erin Brockovich</i>, but the underlying architecture &#x2013; in which a foe is vanquished and order restored to a community &#x2013; stays the same. The monster can be fire in <i>The Towering Inferno</i>, an upturned boat in <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>, or a boy&#x2019;s mother in <i>Ordinary People</i>. Though superficially dissimilar, the skeletons of each are identical.</p> <p></p> <p>Our hero stumbles into a brave new world. At first he is transfixed by its splendour and glamour, but slowly things become more sinister &#x2026;</p> <p></p> <p>It&#x2019;s <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, but it&#x2019;s also <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, <i>Life on Mars</i> and <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i>. And if you replace fantastical worlds with worlds that appear fantastical merely to the protagonists, then quickly you see how <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>, <i>Rebecca</i>, <i>The Line of Beauty</i> and <i>The Third Man</i> all fit the pattern too.</p> <p></p> <p>When a community finds itself in peril and learns the solution lies in finding and retrieving an elixir far, far away, a member of the tribe takes it on themselves to undergo the perilous journey into the unknown &#x2026;</p> <p></p> <p>It&#x2019;s <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, <i>Morte D&#x2019;Arthur</i>, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Watership Down</i>. And if you transplant it from fantasy into something a little more earthbound, it&#x2019;s <i>Master and Commander</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Guns of Navarone</i> and <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. If you then change the object of the characters&#x2019; quest, you find <i>Rififi</i>, <i>The Usual Suspects</i>, <i>Ocean&#x2019;s Eleven</i>, <i>Easy Rider</i> and <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>.</p> <p>So three different tales turn out to have multiple derivatives. Does that mean that when you boil it down there are only three different types of story? No. <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>Alien</i> and <i>Jaws</i> are &#x2018;monster&#x2019; stories &#x2013; but they&#x2019;re also about individuals plunged into a new and terrifying world. In classic &#x2018;quest&#x2019; stories like <i>Apocalypse Now</i> or <i>Finding Nemo</i> the protagonists encounter both monsters <i>and</i> strange new worlds. Even &#x2018;Brave New World&#x2019; stories such as <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i>, <i>Witness</i> and <i>Legally Blonde</i> fit all three definitions: the characters all have some kind of quest, and all have their own monsters to vanquish too. Though they are superficially different, they all share the same framework and the same story engine: all plunge their characters into a strange new world; all involve a quest to find a way out of it; and in whatever form they choose to take, in every story &#x2018;monsters&#x2019; are vanquished. All, at some level, too, have as their goal safety, security, completion and the importance of home.</p> <p>But these tenets don&#x2019;t just appear in films, novels, or indeed TV series like <i>Homeland</i> or <i>The Killing</i>. A nine-year-old child of my friend decided he wanted to tell a story. He didn&#x2019;t consult anyone about it, he just wrote it down:</p> <p></p> <p>A family are looking forward to going on holiday. Mom has to sacrifice the holiday in order to pay the rent. Kids find map buried in garden to treasure hidden in the woods, and decide to go after it. They get in loads of trouble and are chased before they finally find it and go on even better holiday.2</p> <p></p> <p>Why would a child unconsciously echo a story form that harks back centuries? Why, when writing so spontaneously, would he display knowledge of story structure that echoes so clearly generations of tales that have gone before? Why do we all continue to draw our stories from the very same well? It could be because each successive generation copies from the last, thus allowing a series of conventions to become established. But while that may help explain the ubiquity of the pattern, its sturdy resistance to iconoclasm and the freshness and joy with which it continues to reinvent itself suggest something else is going on.</p> <p>Storytelling has a shape. It dominates the way all stories are told and can be traced back not just to the Renaissance, but to the very beginnings of the recorded word. It&#x2019;s a structure that we absorb avidly whether in art-house or airport form and it&#x2019;s a shape that may be &#x2013; though we must be careful &#x2013; a universal archetype.</p> <p></p> <p>&#x2018;Most writing on art is by people who are not artists: thus all the misconceptions.&#x2019;</p> <p>Eug�ne Delacroix</p> <p></p> <p>The quest to detect a universal story structure is not a new one. From the Prague School and the Russian Formalists of the early twentieth century, via Northrop Frye&#x2019;s <i>Anatomy of Criticism</i> to Christopher Booker&#x2019;s <i>The Seven Basic Plots</i>, many have set themselves the task of trying to understand how stories work. In my own field it&#x2019;s a veritable industry &#x2013; there are hundreds of books about screenwriting (though almost nothing sensible about television). I&#x2019;ve read most of them, but the more I read the more two issues nag away:</p> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;Most of them posit completely different systems, all of which claim to be the sole and only way to write stories. How can they all possibly claim to be right? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;None of them asks &#x2018;Why?&#x2019;3 <p>Some of these tomes contain invaluable information; more than a few have worthwhile insights; all of them are keen to tell us <i>how</i> and with great fervour insist that &#x2018;there must be an inciting incident on page 12&#x2019;, but none of them explains <i>why</i> this should be. Which, when you think about it, is crazy: if you can&#x2019;t answer &#x2018;why&#x2019;, the &#x2018;how&#x2019; is an edifice built on sand. And then, once you attempt to answer it yourself, you start to realize that much of the theory &#x2013; incisive though some of it is &#x2013; doesn&#x2019;t quite add up. Did God decree an inciting incident should occur on page 12, or that there were twelve stages to a hero&#x2019;s journey? Of course not: they&#x2019;re constructs. Unless we can find a coherent reason why these shapes exist, then there&#x2019;s little reason to take these people seriously. They&#x2019;re snake-oil salesmen, peddling their wares on the frontier.4</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve been telling stories for almost all my adult life, and I&#x2019;ve had the extraordinary privilege of working on some of the most popular shows on British television. I&#x2019;ve created storylines that have reached over 20 million viewers and I&#x2019;ve been intimately involved with programmes that helped redefine the dramatic landscape. I&#x2019;ve worked, almost uniquely in the industry, on both art-house and populist mainstream programs, loved both equally, and the more I&#x2019;ve told stories, the more I&#x2019;ve realized that the underlying pattern of these plots &#x2013; the ways in which an audience demands certain things &#x2013; has an extraordinary uniformity.</p> <p>Eight years ago I started to read everything on storytelling. More importantly I started to interrogate all the writers I&#x2019;d worked with about how they write. Some embraced the conventions of three-act structure, some refuted it &#x2013; and some refuted it while not realizing they used it anyway. A few writers swore by four acts, some by five; others claimed that there were no such things as acts at all. Some had conscientiously learned from screenwriting manuals while others decried structural theory as the devil&#x2019;s spawn. But there was one unifying factor in every good script I read, whether authored by brand new talent or multiple award-winners, and that was that they all shared the same underlying structural traits.</p> <p>By asking two simple questions &#x2013; what were these traits; and why did they recur &#x2013; I unlocked a cupboard crammed full of history. I soon discovered that the three-act paradigm was not an invention of the modern age but an articulation of something much more primal; that modern act structure was a reaction to dwindling audience attention spans and the invention of the curtain. Perhaps more intriguingly, the history of five-act drama took me back to the Romans, via the nineteenth-century French dramatist Eug�ne Scribe and German novelist Gustav Freytag to Moli�re, Shakespeare and Jonson. I began to understand that, if there really was an archetype, it had to apply not just to screenwriting, but to <i>all</i> narrative structures. One either tells all stories according to a pattern or none at all. If storytelling does have a universal shape, this has to be self-evident.</p> <p>It was an investigation that was to produce a number of interesting offshoots. By concentrating initially on film and television, I was able to:</p> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;explore how story structure works, not just in single-protagonist storytelling but also in multi-protagonist dramas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;explain why protagonists have to be active<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;illustrate how &#x2013; in more detail than ever before &#x2013; the structural principles work in television<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;understand how narration can destroy drama<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;expound on why so many characters die in the penultimate stage of any drama<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;explain why almost all cops are mavericks<br>&nbsp;...</p><h2>Ayurvedic Medicine: The Principles of Traditional Practice</h2><p><p>Ayurvedic Medicine clearly and comprehensively presents the unique theories and traditions of Ayurveda making them accessible to the health practitioner of today. </p><p>With a brief history of traditional medicine in India and discussion of principles, treatment strategies and traditional Ayurvedic pharmacy and pharmacology, the book offers an essential overview of the culture in which Ayurveda has developed and the scientific basis behind this holistic approach.

Trask was Ford Madox Ford&#39;s personal secretary, and later a National Book Award winner and a recipient of Bollingen Foundation grants for his work in medieval and primitive poetry.</p><p>Joan of Arc, the 15th-century "Maid of Orleans" who led French forces in defense of Charles, the Dauphin, and was burned at the stake as a witch by the English authorities, has for many years been a popular figure, written about approvingly by the likes of George Bernard Shaw and Mark Twain. Trask, an independent scholar, gives us Joan in her own words, culled from the trial reports and from eyewitnesses. There are not many words, admittedly, but they are Joan's own and are thus a window into her spirit. The starkness of the words is offset by a 19th-century afterword by Sir Richard Creasy, who provides the context. Readers seeking a more complete account would do well to read Twain's Joan of Arc, recently republished by Ignatius Press. Recommended for academic and larger public libraries.?Augustine J.

And while I would consider all of us experienced meat cookers, every cook here has been pretty radically enlightened by it.</p> <p><em>Charred and Scruffed</em> is a game-changer. It blows open the whole over-saturated category of grilling and will change your meat cooking forever, whether you're a beginner or a hardy veteran of cooking meat with fire and smoke. In this book, Perry Lang teaches you to be an active griller--to abandon the idea and aesthetic of the rigid, perfect, crosshatched grill mark like you find at an Outback or Wendy's--and to instead really move the meat around the grill in a way that it builds up more and more surface area, getting as much char and flavor on every micro-inch of its surface as possible. He prepares the meats by opening them up, either by hand--kind of pulling apart rib roasts or cracking the backs of chickens and stabbing the birds repeatedly (!)--or by cutting shallow, diamond-hatch scoring into the surface of leaner cuts to create more places for crust and char to form, thus letting more flavor develop. And creating more surfaces for the seasoning salts, herby and acidic bastes, and unbelievably delicious and sensible &#x201c;board sauces&#x201d; made right on the cutting board with the juices of the meats themselves, to adhere and cling to. Why no one has thought of the board sauce is a mystery and an example of Adam Perry Lang's genius. After basting the meat frequently throughout its cooking time with a basting brush made of a bunch of herbs--both beautiful and purposeful--you finely mince the tip end of the herb baster brush--which has softened in the heat and released the herbs' fragrant oils--and stir that right into the juices from the rested grilled meat. It is a stroke of brilliance. Utterly freaking delicious and simple and smart.</p> <p>I first caught on to the obsessive genius of Adam Perry Lang and his relationship to meat over ten years ago when I wrote a piece about him for <em>Saveur</em> magazine. At the time he was the chef at Robert's Steakhouse on the west side of Manhattan, which served the best meat in New York City. Everyone who came to know it agreed that it blew the city's famed steakhouses out of the water. At the time Adam was aging meat weeks and even months longer than anyone, anywhere. His walk-ins had an elaborate setup of thermometers, fans, humidifiers and stainless steel metro shelving--and a fastidious date and time labeling system as well. He rotated huge racks of beef, attending to the temperature, humidity and &#x201c;velocity,&#x201d; as he called it, of cool air circulating in the room with a near mania. He was obsessively sourcing meat, flying out to see growers and buyers and packers throughout the Midwest and Texas to understand everything he could about grass and grain and corn. At the same time, just to give you a sense of his energy, he had opened Daisy May Bar B Que and was competing on the national barbecue circuit. And winning!</p> <p>All this to say, there is no single person or team working with meat today who knows more or who has more to share and to learn from.</p> <p>This book is suited for professionals and amateurs alike, men and women, from back yard pit masters to fire-escape kettle-grillers, for dads whose favorite weekend activity is centered around the Weber to die hards who will find themselves shoveling a path to the grill deep in winter just to cook from its pages.</p>Bold New Techniques for Explosive Flavor on and off the Grill</p><h2>As a Man Thinketh (The Tarcher Family Inspirational Library)</h2><p>The mind guides our footsteps as we progress along the pathway of life.<br><br>Purity of mind leads inevitably to purity of life, to the precious love and understanding that should control our everyday acts and attitudes towards friends and foes.<br><br>But where must one look for guidance?

On the last night of 1937, twenty-five-year-old Katey Kontent is in a second-rate Greenwich Village jazz bar when Tinker Grey, a handsome banker, happens to sit down at the neighboring table. This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a year-long journey into the upper echelons of New York society--where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve.

Tinker orbits in the world of the wealthy; Katey and Eve stretch their few dollars out each evening on the town. While all three are complex characters, Katey is the story's shining star. She is a fully realized heroine, unique in her strong sense of self amidst her life's continual fluctuations. Towles' writing also paints an inviting picture of New York City, without forgetting its sharp edges.

Armed with little more than a formidable intellect, a bracing wit, and her own brand of cool nerve, Katey embarks on a journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool through the upper echelons of New York society in search of a brighter future. <br><br> The story opens on New Year's Eve in a Greenwich Village jazz bar, where Katey and her boardinghouse roommate Eve happen to meet Tinker Grey, a handsome banker with royal blue eyes and a ready smile. This chance encounter and its startling consequences cast Katey off her current course, but end up providing her unexpected access to the rarified offices of Conde Nast and a glittering new social circle. Befriended in turn by a shy, principled multimillionaire, an Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, and a single-minded widow who is ahead of her times, Katey has the chance to experience first hand the poise secured by wealth and station, but also the aspirations, envy, disloyalty, and desires that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her orbit, she will learn how individual choices become the means by which life crystallizes loss. <br><br> Elegant and captivating, <i>Rules of Civility</i> turns a Jamesian eye on how spur of the moment decisions define life for decades to come. A love letter to a great American city at the end of the Depression, readers will quickly fall under its spell of crisp writing, sparkling atmosphere and breathtaking revelations, as Towles evokes the ghosts of Fitzgerald, Capote, and McCarthy.<br><br> <strong>Amor Towles's <i>Rules of Civility</i> Playlist</strong> <br> <p><i>You can listen to the playlist here.</i></p> <p>While jazz is not central to the narrative of <i>Rules of Civility</i>, the music and its various formulations are an important component of the book&#x2019;s backdrop.</p> <p>On the night of January 16, 1938, Benny Goodman assembled a bi-racial orchestra to play jazz to a sold-out Carnegie Hall--the first jazz performance in the hallowed hall and one which is now famous for bringing jazz (and black performers) to a wider audience. I am not a jazz historian, but for me the concert marks something of a turning point in jazz itself--from the big-band, swing-era sound that dominated the 1930s (and which the orchestra emphasized on stage that night) towards the more introspective, smaller group styles that would soon spawn bebop and its smoky aftereffects (ultimately reaching an apogee with Miles Davis&#x2019;s <i>Kind of Blue</i> in 1957). For it is also in 1938 that Coleman Hawkins recorded the bebop antecedent "Body &amp; Soul" and Minton&#x2019;s Playhouse, one of the key bebop gathering spots, opened in Harlem. By 1939, Blue Note Records was recording, and Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk were all congregating in New York City. From 1935-1939, Goodman himself was stepping out of the big-band limelight to make more intimate improvisational recordings with a quartet including Gene Krupa and Lionel Hampton.</p> <p>My assertion of this as a turning point (like most such assertions) is rough, inexact and misleading, but it helps give shape to an evolution and bring into relief two ends of a jazz spectrum. On the big-band front, the power of the music naturally springs from the collective and orchestration. In numbers like "Sing, Sing, Sing," the carefully layered, precisely timed waning and waxing of rhythm and instrumentation towards moments of unified musical ecstasy simply demand that the audience collaborate through dance, cheers, and other outward expressions of joy. While in the smaller groups of bebop and beyond, the expressive power springs more from the soloist and his personal exploration of the music, his instrument, and his emotional state at that precise moment in time. This inevitably inspires in the listener a cigarette, a scotch, and a little more introspection. In a sense, the two ends of this jazz spectrum are like the public/private paradox of Walker Evans&#x2019;s subway photographs (and of life in the metropolis itself.)</p> <p>If you are interested, I have created an playlist of music from roughly 1935-1945 that spans this transition. The playlist is not meant to be comprehensive or exact. Among other items, it includes swinging live performances from Goodman&#x2019;s Carnegie Hall Concert as well as examples of his smaller group work; there are precursors to bebop like Coleman Hawkins and some early Charlie Parker. As a strange historical footnote, there was a strike in 1942&#x2013;1944 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which no official recordings were made. As such, this period at the onset of bebop was virtually undocumented and thus the records of 1945 reflect something of a culmination of early bebop rather than its starting point. The playlist also reflects the influence of the great American songbook giants (Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, Rodgers &amp; Hart, the Gershwins), many of whom were at the height of their powers in the 1930s. <i>--Amor Towles</i></p> <p><b>Listen to the playlist</b></p>Amor Towles was born and raised just outside Boston, Massachusetts.

Although once common, this now rare awareness would be labelled by many as a 'sixth sense'. We have become so distanced from this way of experiencing our environment that it may initially seem hard to believe that it is possible, but Tristan Gooley uses a collection of 'keys' to show how everyone can develop this ability and enjoy the outdoors in an exciting way - one that is both new and ancient.</p><p></p><h2>The Broadview Anthology of Expository Prose - Third Edition</h2><p><p>The third edition of this anthology has been substantially revised and updated for a contemporary American audience; a selection of classic essays from earlier eras has been retained, but the emphasis is very much on twenty-first-century expository writing. Works of different lengths and levels of difficulty are represented, as are narrative, descriptive and persuasive essays&#x2015;and, new to this edition, lyric essays. For the new edition there are also considerably more short pieces than ever before; a number of op-ed pieces are included, as are pieces from blogs and from online news sources. The representation of academic writing from several disciplines has been increased&#x2015;and in some cases the anthology also includes news reports presenting the results of academic research to a general audience. Also new to this edition are essays from a wide range of the most celebrated essayists of the modern era&#x2015;from James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, and Annie Dillard to Eula Biss and Ta-Nehisi Coates. </p> <p>The anthology remains broad in its thematic coverage, but certain themes receive special emphasis&#x2015;notably, issues of race, class, and culture in twenty-first century America. </p> <p>For the new edition the headnotes have been expanded, providing students with more information as to the context in which each piece was written. Questions and suggestions for discussion have been moved online to the instructor website. </p></p><p><p><strong>Laura Buzzard</strong> and <strong>Don LePan</strong> are co-authors of <em>The Broadview Pocket Glossary of Literary Terms</em> (2014) and of <em>How to Be Good with Words</em> (forthcoming, 2017); <strong>Nora Ruddock</strong> and <strong>Alexandria Stuart</strong> are, respectively, Developmental Editor and Assistant Editor, at Broadview Press. </p><p><strong>Comments on previous editions:</strong> </p><p>&#x201c;My students&#x2019; responses to the readings have sparked meaningful and productive conversations about culture, education, and our ways of viewing the world. To my delight, at the end of a typical meeting we are left with even more questions than when we began. This text fosters students&#x2019; growth as inquisitive, critical readers and opens the doorway to future academic work.&#x201d; &#x2015; Alixandra V. Krzemien, Canisius College </p> <p> &#x201c;What a wonderful and insightful collection of essays. My writing courses improved by leaps and bounds when I adopted the first edition. ... [W]ith a diverse and engaging range of essays, <em>The Broadview Anthology of Expository Prose</em> challenges writers to read beyond the purview of their experience and knowledge so that their writing can consider and cross more horizons. This collection invites students into serious academic discourse via groundbreaking essays by prominent and influential voices from within and without academia; the second edition will prepare writers to understand how any topic or discipline cultivates networks of dialogue across popular, lyrical, scholarly, experimental, and theoretical styles. Don&#x2019;t be surprised when students read more than the assigned material from <em>The Broadview Anthology</em>, as was the case when I adopted the first edition for my courses; the accessible organization and appeal of this book make it a useful resource for ongoing learning and research.&#x201d; &#x2015; Beth Staley, West Virginia University </p> <p> &#x201c;For the second edition, the editors of <em>The Broadview Anthology of Expository Prose</em> have managed to make significant improvements to what was already an above-average prose anthology. A particular strength of the new edition is the inclusion of paired articles (two articles on the same topic but directed toward different audiences), which provides students with the opportunity to explore the concepts of audience, voice, and purpose in writing.&#x201d; &#x2015; Lisa Salem-Wiseman, Humber College </p> <p> &#x201c;<em>The Broadview Anthology of Expository Prose</em> is one of the best essay anthologies I have seen. The remarkable diversity of the essays covers an impressive range of authors, styles, topics, and viewpoints. Included are essays from the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; scholarly essays, literary essays, and popular essays; traditional essays and contemporary ones; short essays and long ones; essays in a wide range of tones and of voices, by men and women from a wide range of backgrounds. An added bonus is the historical range of prose styles from the seventeenth to the twenty-first centuries. The quality of the essays also deserves high praise; again and again these readings demonstrate how the most common questions may provoke uncommon insights. Many selections have a sharp edge but they challenge a reader&#x2019;s mindset without being confrontational. The topics make one take notice; the essays then lead the reader through the complexities of analysis. This anthology of significant, incisive, diverse essays should make a significant contribution to the recognition of the essay as a vitally important genre&#x2015;and of essay writing as a vitally important literary and argumentative art.&#x201d; &#x2015; Paul D.

J. M. Blaut persuasively argues that this doctrine is not grounded in the facts of history and geography, but in the ideology of colonialism. Blaut traces the colonizer&#39;s model of the world from its 16th-century origins to its present form in theories of economic development, modernization, and new world order.</p><p>J. M. Blaut, PhD, until his death in 2000, was Professor of Geography at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The author of <i>The Colonizer's Model of the World</i> and <i>Eight Eurocentric Historians</i>, Dr. Blaut was a recipient of the Distinguished Scholarship Award from the Association of American Geographers (AAG). Awards in his name are given annually by the Cultural and Political Ecology Specialty Group and the Socialist and Critical Geography Specialty Group of the AAG."No scholarly book could possibly be totally new or original in this era, but Blaut's powerful and tightly focused opus comes close in the way he has marshalled and distilled a vast array of literature and evidence and the vigor and rigor with which he has pursued his central theses--propositions of unusual intellectual significance and timeliness. I find his argument quite persuasive and potentially mind-altering....This is a work with truly revolutionary implications, a badly needed recasting of our badly flawed, conventional First World vision of ourselves and the thrust of modern history. This could come to be regarded as a landmark achievement." --Wilbur Zelinsky, PhD, Penn State University<br><br> "This is a dogmatically written, occasionally outrageous, and absolutely spellbinding book. It is a strongly argued, alternative interpretation of the basic causes for the rise of the west to the hegemonic position it has occupied for perhaps five centuries....It is a major contribution to the debate now coming to the fore in the field. It makes its contribution through a merciless critique of mainline theories, by its selective synthesis of subaltern scholarship (both theory and piecemeal empirical evidence), and by its integration of whatever evidence exists to support this alternative position....I would plan to recommend it to my students as highlighting many of the controversies of the field and as representing an exaggerated version of one possible position." --Janet Abu-Lughod, Ph.D., The New School for Social Research<br><br> "Will add excitement to courses in world history and self-critical Western Civilization and European history courses. I have adopted this provocative new book for my graduate colloquium on theories of world history and think that undergraduates too would enjoy Blaut's clarity of analysis and passionate writing. He depicts Eurocentric diffusionism as a pernicious ideology justifying European and United States colonial and neocolonial domination of the rest of the world. His largest chapter refutes 'the myth of the European miracle,' the decisive superiority that Western Europe allegedly had achieved independent of outside help. Blaut, a historical geographer, has assembled a wealth of evidence for many parts of the world both for the long period before 1492 and for the transitional period of 1492 to 1688. As one who has taught European history since the early 1960's and world history since the late 1980's I enthusiastically welcome this exciting book which challenges and explains assumptions about European superiority." --David M. Fahey, Miami University -Adopted for Theories of History (World)<br><br> "Jim Blaut has written an exciting book that successfully challenges conventional Eurocentric diffusionism. The text is very accessible and is well documented with numerous concrete historical examples. The book is very popular among the students that I teach." --Daniel Weiner, Associate Professor of Geography, West Virginia University<br><br> "My students are enthralled by the accounts in the book of the participation of other regions of the world in the making of modern world history. The book is easy to read without the need for much prior knowledge. Nearly a quarter-century after its publication, the book's themes are just as relevant--if not more so--for helping us understand the process of globalization today."--Sing C. Chew, PhD, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research&#x2013;UFZ Leipzig, and Humboldt State University<br><br> "...Attributing European supremacy, in part at any rate, to something resembling chance - Blaut throws down the gauntlet to those still coddling the model of an Inside/Outside world [his language] waiting to be 'modernized' and saved from itself." --B. Marie Perinbam, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland<br><br> "Blaut could offer us sound leadership, in heeding Chaudhuri's (1990:43) sound admonition that 'the ceaseless quest of modern historians looking for the 'origins' and roots of capitalism is not much better than the alchemist's search for the philosopher's stone that transforms base metal into gold' -and still less to look for them under a proverbial lamppost in European history, when most of the gold was, and still is, to be found elsewhere in the world." --Andre Gunder Frank, Faculty of Economics, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands<br><br>"...an engaging book...a clear and accessible style, generally valid assertions, and an explicit sense of geography. The book serves as a valuable foil against a persistent Eurocentric bias in historical interpretationeffectively challenging how we look at the world.", <i>The Professional Geographer</i> Published On: 1993-10-31<br><br>"....someone sounding off on a favorite topic can be fascinating, and Professor Blaut, an American, is certainly that.", <i>New Scientist</i> Published On: 1993-10-31<br><br>"Drawing from his many years of research on the historical and political geography of non-Western development, Blaut challenges the concept of diffusionism as believed and practiced by most scholars to explain the spatial inequalities of global wealth....Blaut presents arguments in a clear, highly readable, and engrossing fashion....Blaut's greatest contribution is to call on readers to rethink the multitude of flawed Eurocentric assumptions upon which modern scholarly inquiry is based.", <i>Growth and Change</i></p><h2>The LEGO Power Functions Idea Book, Volume 1: Machines and Mechanisms</h2><p>This first volume of <i>The LEGO Power Functions Idea Book, Machines and Mechanisms</i>, showcases small projects to build with LEGO Technic gears, motors, gadgets, and other moving elements.

Now recognized as an unparalleled poet of the natural world, Mary Oliver writes with unmatched dexterity and a profound appreciation for the divergence and convergence of all living things.<br><br>Mary Oliver is always searching for the soul of things. In poem after poem, her investigations go from the humble green bean that nourishes her and makes her wonder if "something/-I can't name it-watches as I walk the/rows, accepting the gift of their lives/to assist mine" to the vast, untouchable bliss of "things you can't reach./But you can reach out to them, and all day long./The wind, the bird flying away./The idea of God." Oliver's search grows and is informed by experience, meditation, perception, and discernment. And all the while, during her quest, she is constantly surprised and fortified by joy.<br><br>This graceful volume, designed to be paired with <i>New and Selected Poems, Volume One,</i> includes new poems on birds, toads, flowers, insects, bodies of water, and the extraordinary experience of the everyday in our lives. In the words of Alicia Ostriker,'Mary Oliver moves by instinct, faith, and determination. She is among our finest poets, and still growing.' In both the older and new poems, Mary Oliver is a poet at the height of her control of image and language.</p><p>A private person by nature, <b>Mary Oliver</b> (1935&#x2013;2019) gave very few interviews over the years. Instead, she preferred to let her work speak for itself. And speak it has, for the past five decades, to countless readers. The <i>New York Times</i> recently acknowledged Mary Oliver as &#x201c;far and away, this country&#x2019;s best-selling poet.&#x201d; Born in a small town in Ohio, Oliver published her first book of poetry in 1963 at the age of 28; <i>No Voyage and Other Poems</i>, originally printed in the UK by Dent Press, was reissued in the United States in 1965 by Houghton Mifflin. Oliver has since published twenty books of poetry and six books of prose. As a young woman, Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but took no degree. She lived for several years at the home of Edna St. Vincent Millay in upper New York state, companion to the poet&#x2019;s sister Norma Millay. It was there, in the late &#x2019;50s, that she met photographer Molly Malone Cook. For more than forty years, Cook and Oliver made their home together, largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook&#x2019;s death in 2005. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Oliver has received numerous awards. Her fourth book, <i>American Primitive</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1984. She has also received the Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Achievement Award; the Christopher Award and the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award for House of Light; the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems; a Lannan Foundation Literary Award; and the New England Booksellers Association Award for Literary Excellence. Oliver&#x2019;s essays have appeared in <i>Best American Essays</i> 1996, 1998, 2001; the Anchor Essay Annual 1998, as well as Orion, Onearth and other periodicals. Oliver was editor of <i>Best American Essays</i> 2009. Oliver&#x2019;s books on the craft of poetry, <i>A Poetry Handbook</i> and <i>Rules for the Dance</i>, are used widely in writing programs. She is an acclaimed reader and has read in practically every state as well as other countries. She has led workshops at various colleges and universities, and held residencies at Case Western Reserve University, Bucknell University, University of Cincinnati, and Sweet Briar College. From 1995, for five years, she held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College. She has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from The Art Institute of Boston (1998), Dartmouth College (2007) and Tufts University (2008).Following by 13 years her National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>New and Selected Volume One</i>, this big and very quotable collection offers more of what Oliver's fans revere: optimistic, clear and lyrical explorations of varying ecosystems, (especially the birds, mammals, ponds and forests of the northeastern U.S.) mingled with rapt self-questioning, consolation and spiritual claims some might call prayers. One of the 42 new poems watches ravens on a "morning of green tenderness and/ rain"; others describe a mockingbird, a white heron, an obedient dog, tiger lilies, deer, terns, blueberry fields on Cape Cod (where Oliver lives) and a "Mountain Lion on East Hill Road," glimpsed just "once, years ago." Poems reprinted from six earlier books (beginning with 1994's <i>White Pine</i>) broaden the focus to insect life, to weather and the seasons ("I have talked with the faint clouds in the sky") and to other parts of the U.S.; while most poems use a mellifluous free verse, some choose the simplicities of prose, a form best achieved in <i>Winter Hours</i> (1999). <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It begins with Peanuts&#x2019; third full year and a cast of eight: Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, baby Linus, and Snoopy. By the end of 1954, Pigpen and his dust cloud join the crowd. Linus emerges as one of the most complex and endearing characters in the strip, and acquires his security blanket! Charlie Brown is becoming his best-known self, the lovable loser, but he hasn&#x2019;t yet abandoned his brasher, prankish behavior from our first volume. And, Lucy has grown up and forcefully elbowed her way to the center of the action. For readers unfamiliar with the early years of the strip, Snoopy&#x2019;s appearances here may come as the biggest surprise: he behaves, for the most part, like a dog!</p><p>The second volume of Fantagraphics Books' monumental <i>Complete Peanuts</i> series covers 1953-54, and the visual style and character development is closer to the kids we know and love, as they try to exist in a grown-up world. Charlie Brown is no longer the object of Patty and Violet's affection--derision, more like--and his pattern of losing continues. His misery at checkers hits 5000 (June 1953), 6000 (August), 7000 (November), 8000 (still November), and 10,000 (December) consecutive games, he gets shut out on Valentine's Day (February '53), he wears his first bad Halloween costume (October '54), and he gets a form rejection slip from Santa (December '54). On the baseball diamond, though, he actually has the lead in a game (April '53, but we don't see the final score) and briefly plays catcher. By now Lucy has become the main girl in the strip, and in addition to beating Charlie Brown at checkers, she begins her romantic pursuit of Schroeder (January '53), joins the baseball team (August '54), and wins her third consecutive Miss Fussbudget of the Year title (November '54). Her younger brother, Linus, starts what will become a longstanding feud with Snoopy in the first Sunday strip of '53, shows he's a prodigy in jump rope, blocks, houses of cards, and balloon blowing, and cuddles his security blanket (May '54). Schroeder continues his obsession with Beethoven and reveals the secret to playing great literature on a plastic piano with painted-on black keys (practice and "getting the breaks"). We meet two new characters, the perpetually dirty Pig-Pen (July '54) and the loudmouthed Charlotte Braun, whose funny name wasn't enough to keep her around for long. <p> Charles M. Schulz, whose own insecurity manifested itself in Charlie Brown (who not coincidentally draws his own cartoons), came up with his first multiple-strip storyline (starting with a four-Sunday series of Lucy joining a golf tournament coached by Charlie Brown, May '54) in this period, and provides us with a glimpse of the 1950s--deco furniture ("What in the world is a rocking chair"? asks CB), 3-D movies, H-bomb testing, and even what in hindsight looks like a prediction of the troubles in Vietnam (May '54). The second volume maintains the high quality of the first volume; even if it doesn't have the same extent of extra materials, it has an introduction by Walter Cronkite, a note on one strip that had to be partially reconstructed, and that handy index of characters and topics. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p>Charles M. Schulz was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip Barney Google).In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 Ripley's Believe It or Not! installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post&#x2015;as well as, to the local St. Paul Pioneer Press, a weekly comic feature called Li'l Folks. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, Li'l Folks. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become Peanuts&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first Peanuts daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from Peanuts at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><h2>Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder)</h2><p><p><em>This is a city that seduces dreamers . . . then eats their dreams.</em></p><p>Matthew Scudder understands the futility of his search for a longtime missing Midwestern innocent who wanted to be an actress in the vast meat-grinder called New York City. But her frantic father heard that Schudder is the best&#x2014;and now the ex-cop-turned-p.i. is scouring the hell called Hell's Kitchen looking for anything that might resemble a lead. And in this neighborhood of the lost, he's finding love&#x2014;and death&#x2014;in the worst possible places.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p>The prolific author's humanity and the immediacy of his understated style are again evidenced in his seventh mystery related by Matt Scudder: ex-NYPD officer, recovering alcoholic, and now private detective ( When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes , etc.). This novel opens with Matt looking for Paula Hoeldtke, an aspiring actress who disappeared a short time after she arrived in Manhattan from Muncie, Ind. In an unrelated case, Matt investigates the apparent suicide of a fellow AA member, Eddie Dunphy, and becomes the lover of Willa Rossiter, who manages the apartment house where Eddie lived. The affair flourishes despite warnings from his AA sponsor about an involvement with Willa, a heavy drinker. Matt ignores the advice, as he does the anonymous phone calls ordering him to quit asking questions about the missing girl and Eddie's death. In time, the dogged investigator uncovers the appalling facts that close both cases. In this riveting mystery, Block's artistry creates a full complement of fully realized characters, each a real person regardless of his or her perhaps tenuous connection to the plot. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mrs. Jeffries Takes Tea at Three (A Victorian Mystery)</h2><p>This book is a trade paperback anthology of the following three Mrs. Jeffries mysteries that were previously published as separate titles in paperback format:<br><br><ol><li>Mrs. Jeffries Plays the Cook</li><li>Mrs. Jeffries and the Missing Alibi</li><li>Mrs. Jeffries Stands Corected.</li></ol>It is not a&nbsp;new original work by Emily Brightwell.</p><p><b>Emily Brightwell</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Victorian Mystery series featuring Inspector Witherspoon and Mrs. Jeffries.PRAISE FOR THE MRS.

While many aficionados of the Broadway musical associate it with wonderful, diversionary shows like The Music Man or My Fair Lady, John Bush Jones instead selects musicals for their social relevance and the extent to which they engage, directly or metaphorically, contemporary politics and culture. Organized chronologically, with some liberties taken to keep together similarly themed musicals, Jones examines dozens of Broadway shows from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present that demonstrate numerous links between what played on Broadway and what played on newspapers&#x2019; front pages across our nation. He reviews the productions, lyrics, staging, and casts from the lesser-known early musicals (the &#x201c;gunboat&#x201d; musicals of the Teddy Roosevelt era and the &#x201c;Cinderella shows&#x201d; and &#x201c;leisure time musicals&#x201d; of the 1920s) and continues his analysis with better-known shows including Showboat, Porgy and Bess, Oklahoma, South Pacific, West Side Story, Cabaret, Hair, Company, A Chorus Line, and many others. While most examinations of the American musical focus on specific shows or emphasize the development of the musical as an art form, Jones&#x2019;s book uses musicals as a way of illuminating broader social and cultural themes of the times. With six appendixes detailing the long-running diversionary musicals and a foreword by Sheldon Harnick, the lyricist of Fiddler on the Roof, Jones&#x2019;s comprehensive social history will appeal to both students and fans of Broadway.</p><p>6 x 9 1/4 trim.JOHN BUSH JONES is a retired Professor of Theater Arts at Brandeis University.

Faulkner wanted to use the time remaining to him to achieve a summing-up of his fictional world: &#x201c;I know I won&#x2019;t live long enough to write all I need to write about my imaginary country and county,&#x201d; he wrote to a friend, &#x201c;so I must not waste what I have left.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Town</i>&nbsp;(1957) is the second novel in the Snopes trilogy that began with&nbsp;<i>The Hamlet</i>&nbsp;(collected in a previous Library of America volume).

In this last part of the trilogy, Faulkner brings in elements from many earlier novels to round out his fictional enterprise.<br><br>His last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Reivers: A Reminiscence</i>&nbsp;(1962), is distinctly mellower and more elegiac than his earlier work.

What is The Social Network--and Facebook itself--really about? "It's a cruel portrait of us: 500 million sentient people entrapped in the recent careless thoughts of a Harvard sophomore." Why do we love libraries? "Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay." What will we tell our granddaughters about our collective failure to address global warming? "So I might say to her, look: the thing you have to appreciate is that we'd just been through a century of relativism and deconstruction, in which we were informed that most of our fondest-held principles were either uncertain or simple wishful thinking, and in many areas of our lives we had already been asked to accept that nothing is essential and everything changes--and this had taken the fight out of us somewhat."<br><br>Gathering in one place for the first time previously unpublished work, as well as already classic essays, such as, "Joy," and, "Find Your Beach," <i>Feel Free </i>offers a survey of important recent events in culture and politics, as well as Smith's own life.

An indispensable reference book for anyone interested in psychoanalysis.</strong></p> Sigmund Freud evolved his theories throughout his lifetime. This entailed many revisions and changes which he himself never tried to standardize rigidly into a definitive conceptual system. The need for some sort of a reliable guide which would spell out both the pattern of the evolution of Freud's thinking, as well as establish its inherent logic, was felt for a long time by both scholars and students of psychoanalysis. Drs. Laplanche and Pontalis of the Association Psychoanalytique de France succeeded admirably in providing a dictionary of Freud's concepts which is more than a compilation of mere definitions. After many years of creative and industrious research, they were able to give an authentic account of the evolution of each concept with pertinent supporting texts from Freud's own writing (in the Standard Edition translation), and thus have endowed us with an instrument for work and research which is characterized by its thoroughness, exactitude and lack of prejudice towards dogma.</p><p>Jean Laplanche (1924 - 2012) was described by the journal &#39;Radical Philosophy&#39; as &#34;the most original and philosophically informed psychoanalytic theorist of his day.&#34; Studying philosophy under Hyppolite, Bachelard, and Merleau-Ponty, he became an active member of the French Resistance under the Vichy regime. Under the influence (and treatment) of Jacques Lacan, Laplanche came to earn a doctorate in medicine and was certified as a psychoanalyst. He eventually broke ties with Lacan and began regularly publishing influential contributions to psychoanalytic theory, his first volume appearing in 1961. In 1967 he published, with his colleague J.-B. Pontalis, the celebrated encyclopaedia &#39;The Language of Psychoanalysis&#39;. A member of the International Psychoanalytical Association, co-founder of the Association Psychanalytique de France, emeritus professor and founder of the Center for Psychoanalytic Research at the Universite de Paris VII, and assistant professor at the Sorbonne, he also oversaw, as scientific director, the translation of Freud&#39;s complete oeuvre into French for the Presses Universitaires de France.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Materials for Civil and Construction Engineers</h2><p><p> <b>Civil and Construction Engineering Materials: Properties, Uses, and Evaluations</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Materials for Civil and Construction Engineers </i> </b>helps readers understand and select the materials involved in supporting the infrastructure needs of society--from buildings, to water and treatment distribution systems, to dams, highways, and airport pavements.

In this new biography, Webster is seen as a major player in American politics in the era between the War of 1812 and the beginning of the Civil War, involved with every significant issue confronting the new nation. Webster had no equal as an orator, then or since. Whether in the Senate, before the Supreme Court, or on the political stump, he was a golden-tongued spellbinder, often holding audiences in thrall for hours. In his lifelong defense of the Constitution, and as a constant upholder of the Union, Webster won love and respect. He was often referred to as "the Godlike Daniel". But he was also referred to as "Black Dan" because of his questionable dealings with men of wealth and power, his political conniving, his habitual nonpayment of debts, and perhaps even his somewhat roving eye.</p><p>In this monumental new biography, Robert V. Remini gives us a full life of Webster from his birth, early schooling, and rapid rise as a lawyer and politician in New Hampshire to his equally successful career in Massachusetts where he moved in 1816. Remini treats both the man and his time as they tangle in issues such as westward expansion, growth of democracy, market revolution, slavery and abolitionism, the National Bank, and tariff issues. Webster&#39;s famous speeches are fully discussed as are his relations with the other two of the &#34;great triumvirate&#34;, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. Throughout, Remini pays close attention to Webster&#39;s personal life - perhaps more than Webster would have liked - his relationships with family and friends, and his murky financial dealings with men of wealth and influence.Robert V. Remini is professor of history and research professor of humanities at the University of Illinois in Chicago.</p><h2>Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora</h2><p>This volume introduces black science fiction, fantasy, and speculative fiction writers to the generations of readers who have not had the chance to explore the scope and diversity among African-American writers.</p><p>Dark matter: the nonluminous matter, not yet detected, that nonetheless has detectable gravitational effects on the universe.<p> Dark matter: the Afro-American presence and influences unseen or unacknowledged by Euro-American culture. </p><p> <i>Dark Matter</i>: the first anthology to illuminate the presence and influence of black writers in speculative fiction, with 25 stories, three novel excerpts, and five essays.</p><p> This anthology's critical and historical importance is indisputable. But that's not why it will prove to be the best anthology of 2000 in both the speculative and the literary fiction fields. It's because the stories are great: entertaining, imaginative, insightful, sharply characterized, and beautifully written. The earliest story in <i>Dark Matter</i> is acclaimed literary author Charles W. Chesnutt's "The Goophered Grapevine" (1887), in which an aging ex-slave tells a chilling tale of cursed land to a white Northerner buying a Southern plantation. In "The Comet" (1920), W.E.B. Du Bois portrays the rich white woman and the poor black man who may be the only survivors of an astronomical near-miss. In George S. Schuyler's "Black No More" (1931), an excerpt from the satirical novel of the same name, an African American scientist invents a machine that can turn blacks white. More recent reprints include science fiction master Samuel R. Delany's Nebula Award-winning "Aye, and Gomorrah..." (1967), which delineates the socio-sexual effects of asexual astronauts; Charles R. Saunders's heroic fantasy "Gimmile's Songs" (1984), in which a woman warrior encounters a singer with a frightening, compelling magic in ancient West Africa; MacArthur Genius Grant recipient Octavia E. Butler's powerful "The Evening and the Morning and the Night" (1987), in which the cure for cancer creates a terrifying new disease of compulsive self-mutilation; and Derrick Bell's angry, riveting "The Space Traders" (1992), in which aliens offer to trade their advanced technology to the U.S. in exchange for its black population. Other reprints include "Ark of Bones" (1974) by author-poet-folklorist Henry Dumas; "Future Christmas" (1982) by master satirist Ishmael Reed; "Rhythm Travel" (1996) by playwright-poet-critic Amiri Baraka (who has also written as LeRoi Jones and Imamu Amiri Baraka); and "The African Origins of UFOs" (2000) by London-based West Indian author Anthony Joseph.</p><p> Most of the stories in <i>Dark Matter</i> are original; these range even more widely in their concerns and themes. In the generation ship of Linda Addison's "Twice, at Once, Separated," a Yanomami Indian tribe preserves its culture in coexistence with technology, while visions tear a young woman from her own wedding. Bestselling novelist Steven Barnes examines degrees of privilege and deprivation when an African American woman artist is trapped in an African concentration camp in his unflinching contribution, "The Woman in the Wall." In John W. Campbell Award winner Nalo Hopkinson's sexy, scary "Ganger (Ball Lightning)," two lovers drifting apart try to reconnect through the separation of virtual sex. A mystic power awakens in the devastated future of Ama Patterson's gorgeous and tough "Hussy Strutt." An artist's infidelity changes two generations in Leone Ross's astute, magic-realist "Tasting Songs." In Nisi Shawl's sharp, witty mythic fantasy "At the Huts of Ajala," the spirit of a modern woman must outwit a god before she is even born. Others contributing new stories are Tananarive Due, Robert Fleming, Jewelle Gomez, Akua Lezli Hope, Honor�e Fanonne Jeffers, Kalamu ya Salaam, Kiini Ibura Salaam, Evie Shockley, and Darryl A.

He has a daughter he rarely sees and his mailman Jansson is the closest thing he has to a friend, and to an adversary. He is perfectly content to live out his days in quiet solitude.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One autumn evening, he is startled awake by a blinding light--only to discover that his house is on fire. With the help of Jansson, he escapes the flames just in time wearing two left boots. Dawn reveals that everything he owns is now a smoldering pile of ash and his house is destroyed--forcing him to move into an abandoned trailer on his island. A local journalist, Lisa Modin, who wants to write a story about the fire, comes into his life. In doing so, she awakens in him something that he thought was long dead. Soon after, his daughter comes to the island with surprising news of her own. Meanwhile, the police suspect Fredrik of arson because he had a sizable insurance claim on his house. When Fredrik is away from the archipelago, another house goes up in flames and the community realizes they have an arsonist in their midst.&nbsp;<i>After the Fire</i>&nbsp;is an intimate portrait of an elderly recluse who is forced to open himself up to a world he'd left behind.</p><p>Henning Mankell&#39;s novels have been translated into forty-five languages and have sold more than forty million copies worldwide. He was the first winner of the Ripper Award and also received the Glass Key and the Crime Writers&#39; Association Golden Dagger, among other awards. His Kurt Wallander mysteries have been adapted into a PBS television series starring Kenneth Branagh. During his life, Mankell divided his time between Sweden and Mozambique, where he was artistic director of the Teatro Avenida in Maputo. He died in 2015.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house burned down on an autumn night almost a year ago. It was a Sunday. The wind had got <br> up during the afternoon and by the evening the anemometer indicated that the gusts measured over twenty metres per second.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind was coming from the north and was very chilly in spite of the fact that it was still early <br> autumn. When I went to bed at around half past ten I thought that this would be the first storm of the <br> season, moving in across the island I had inherited from my maternal grandparents.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon it would be winter. One night the sea would slowly begin to ice over.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the first night I wore socks to bed. The cold was tightening its grip.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous month, with some difficulty, I had managed to fix the roof. It was a big job for a <br> small workman. Many of the slates were old and cracked. My hands, which had once held a scalpel <br> during complex surgical procedures, were not made for manipulating broken tiles.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ture Jansson, who had spent his entire working life as the postman out here in the islands before <br> he retired, agreed to fetch the new slates from the harbour although he refused to accept any payment. As I have set up an improvised surgery in my boathouse in order to deal with all his imaginary medical <br> complaints, perhaps he thought he ought to return the favour.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years now I have stood there on the jetty by the boathouse examining his allegedly painful <br> arms and back. I have brought out the stethoscope which hangs beside a decoy duck and established that his heart and lungs sound absolutely fine. In every single examination I have found Jansson to be in the best of health. His fear of these imaginary ailments has been so extreme that I have never seen anything like it in all my years as a doctor. He was simultaneously the postman and a full-time hypochondriac.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion he insisted he had toothache, at which point I refused to have anything to do <br> with his problem. I don't know whether he went to see a dentist on the mainland or not. I wonder if he's <br> ever had a single cavity. Perhaps he was in the habit of grinding his teeth while he was asleep, and that's <br> what caused the pain?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the night of the fire I had taken a sleeping tablet as usual and dropped off almost immediately.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was woken by a light being switched on. When I opened my eyes, I was surrounded by a dazzling brightness. Beneath the ceiling of my bedroom I could see a band of grey smoke. I must have pushed off my socks in my sleep when the room got hot. I leaped out of bed, ran down the stairs and into the kitchen through that harsh, searing light. The clock on the wall was showing nineteen minutes past <br> midnight. I grabbed my black raincoat from the hook by the back door, pulled on my wellington boots, <br> one of which was almost impossible to get my foot into, and rushed outside.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was already in flames, the fire roaring. I had to go down to the jetty and the boathouse <br> before the heat became unbearable. During those first few minutes I didn't even think about what had <br> caused this disastrous conflagration; I just watched as the impossible unfolded before my eyes. My heart <br> was pounding so hard I thought it would be smashed to pieces inside my chest. The fire was ravaging me <br> in equal measure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time melted away in the heat. Boats began to arrive from the other islands and skerries, the residents rudely woken from their sleep, but afterwards I was unable to say how long it took or who was <br> there. My gaze was fixed on the flames, the sparks whirling up into the night sky. For one terrifying <br> moment I thought I saw the elderly figures of my grandmother and my grandfather standing on the far <br> side of the fire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are not many of us out here on the islands in the autumn, when the summer visitors <br> disappear and the last of the yachts return to their home harbours, wherever those might be. But someone had seen the glow of the fire in the darkness, the message had been passed along, and everyone wanted to help. The coastguard's firefighting equipment was used to pump up seawater and spray it on the burning building, but it was too late. All it changed was the smell. Charred oak timbers and wall panels, burned wallpaper and linoleum flooring combined with salt water to give off an unforgettable stench. When dawn broke all that remained was a smoking, stinking ruin. The wind had dropped - the storm had already moved on, heading towards the Gulf of Finland - but it had fulfilled its spiteful task, working together with the blaze, and now there was nothing left of my grandparents' pretty house.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when I first thought to ask myself: how had the fire broken out? I hadn't lit any candles <br> or left any of the old paraffin lamps burning. I hadn't had a cigarette or used the wood-burning stove. The electrical wiring throughout the house had been renewed just a few years ago.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was as if the house had set fire to itself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if a house could commit suicide as a result of weariness, old age and sorrow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realised I had been mistaken about a key aspect of my life. After performing an operation that <br> went disastrously wrong and led to a young woman losing her arm, I moved out here many years ago. <br> Back then I often thought that the house in which I was living had been here on the day when I was born, and that it mwould still be here on the day when I no longer existed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was mistaken. The oak trees, the birches, the alders and the single ash tree would remain <br> here after I was gone, but of my beautiful home in the archipelago only the foundations, hauled to the <br> island across the ice from the long-defunct quarry at Hakansborg, would remain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My train of thought was interrupted as Jansson appeared beside me. He was bare-headed, wearing very old dark blue overalls and a pair of motorcycle gloves that I recognised from the winters when the ice had not been thick enough to drive across, and he had used his hydrocopter to deliver the post.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was staring at my old green wellingtons. When I looked down I realised I had pulled on two left boots in my haste. Now I understood why it had been so difficult to put one of them on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'll bring you a boot,' Jansson said. 'I've got a few pairs back at home.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There might be a spare pair down in the boathouse,' I suggested.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No. I've been to look. There are some leather shoes and some old crampons people used to fix onto their boots when they went out on the ice clubbing seals.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that Jansson had already been rooting around in my boathouse shouldn't have surprised <br> me, even if on this occasion he had done it out of consideration. I already knew that he was in the habit of going in there. Jansson was a snooper. From an early stage I had been convinced that he read every postcard that passed through his hands when the summer visitors bought their stamps down by the jetties.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at me with tired eyes. It had been a long night.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Where will you live? What are you going to do now?'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't reply because I didn't have an answer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuffled closer to the smoking ruin. The boot on my right foot was chafing. This is what I own now, I thought. Two wellingtons that aren't even a pair. Everything else is gone. I don't even have any clothes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, as I grasped the full extent of the disaster that had befallen me, it was as if a howl swept through my body. But I heard nothing. Everything that happened within me was soundless.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jansson appeared beside me once more. He has a curious way of moving, as if he has paws instead of feet. He comes from nowhere and suddenly materialises. He seems to know how to stay out of another person's field of vision all the time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why hadn't his wretched house on Stangskar burned down instead?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jansson gave a start as if he had picked up on my embittered thought, but then I realised I had pulled a face, and he thought it was because he had come too close.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You can come and stay with me, of course,' he offered when he had recovered his equilibrium.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thank you.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I noticed my daughter Louise's caravan, which was behind Jansson in a grove of alders alongside a tall oak tree that had not yet lost all its leaves. The caravan was still partly concealed by its <br> low branches.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I've got the caravan,' I said. 'I can live there for the time being.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jansson looked surprised but didn't say anything.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the people who had turned up during the night were starting to head back to their boats, but <br> before they left they came over to say they were happy to help with whatever I needed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of a few hours my life had changed so completely that I actually needed <br> everything.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't even have a matching pair of wellingtons.</p><h2>The Real Book - Sixth Edition (Pocket Edition)</h2><p>THE REAL BOOK - POCKET EDITION, C Pocketversionen av The Real Book.

Having studied at Yale and Dartmouth, Dr. Emily Transue arrives in Seattle to start her internship in Internal Medicine just after graduating from medical school. This series of loosely interconnected scenes from the author's medical training concludes her residency three years later.</p><p>During her first week as a student on the medical wards, Dr. Transue watched someone come into the emergency room in cardiac arrest and die. Nothing like this had ever happened to her before-it was a long way from books and labs. So she began to record her experiences as she gained confidence putting her book knowledge to work.</p><p>The stories focus on the patients Dr. Transue encountered in the hospital, ER and clinic; some are funny and others tragic. They range in scope from brief interactions in the clinic to prolonged relationships during hospitalization. There is a man newly diagnosed with lung cancer who is lyrical about his life on a sunny island far away, and a woman, just released from a breathing machine after nearly dying, who sits up and demands a cup of coffee.</p><p>Though the book has a great deal of medical content, the focus is more on the stories of the patients' lives and illnesses and the relationships that developed between the patients and the author, and the way both parties grew in the course of these experiences.</p><p>Along the way, the book describes the life of a resident physician and reflects on the way the medical system treats both its patients and doctors. <i>On Call</i> provides a window into the experience of patients at critical junctures in life and into the author's own experience as a new member of the medical profession.</p></p><p><p><b>Emily R.

She works as a general internist at a multispecialty clinic in downtown Seattle.</p><p>"The chemistry that happens between doctors and patients, the natural sympathy that is so strong in some interactions and so elusive in others, I sensed intuitively when I first started clinical work, but began to try to analyze only later. I have come to think that doctors and patients, like lovers or friends, can have a deep instinct to connect with each other in some instances and not in others. You can work around the connection, care for someone without it, learn to modulate it; the bond can appear suddenly after a long time of being absent. but the basic chemistry is real."<br>Copyright 2004 by Emily R.

But while much progress has been made, many well-intentioned efforts have led Christians to actions that are not only ineffective, but leave the most vulnerable in a worse situation than before. Is there a better answer?</p><p>Combining biblical exegesis with proven economic principles, <em>For the Least of These: A Biblical Answer to Poverty</em> equips Christians with both a solid biblical and economic understanding of how best to care for the poor and foster sustainable economic development. With contributions from fifteen leading Christian economists, theologians, historians, and practitioners, it presents the case for why a multi-faceted approach is needed, and why a renewed focus on markets and trade are the world&#x2019;s best hope for alleviating poverty and serving those in financial need.</p></p><p><p>Anne R.

John Adams went to Harvard, James Madison to Princeton, and Alexander Hamilton to Columbia, making Washington self-conscious about what he called his &#x201c;defective education.&#x201d; </p> <p> --Washington never had wooden teeth. He wore dentures that were made of either walrus or elephant ivory and were fitted with real human teeth. Over time, as the ivory got cracked and stained, it resembled the grain of wood. Washington may have purchased some of his teeth from his own slaves. </p> <p> --Washington had a strangely cool and distant relationship with his mother. During the Revolutionary War and her son&#x2019;s presidency, she never uttered a word of praise about him and she may even have been a Tory. No evidence exists that she ever visited George and Martha Washington at Mount Vernon. Late in the Revolutionary War, Mary Washington petitioned the Virginia legislature for financial relief, pleading poverty&#x2014;and, by implication, neglect by her son. Washington, who had been extremely generous to his mother, was justly indignant. </p> <p> --Even as a young man, Washington seemed to possess a magical immunity to bullets. In one early encounter in the French and Indian War, he absorbed four bullets in his coat and hat and had two horses shot from under him yet emerged unscathed. This led one Indian chief to predict that some higher power was guiding him to great events in the future. </p> <p> --By age 30 Washington had survived smallpox, malaria, dysentery, and other diseases. Although he came from a family of short-lived men, he had an iron constitution and weathered many illnesses that would have killed a less robust man. He lived to the age of 67. </p> <p> --While the Washingtons were childless&#x2014;it has always been thought that George Washington was sterile&#x2014;they presided over a household teeming with children. Martha had two children from her previous marriage and she and George later brought up two grandchildren as well, not to mention countless nieces and nephews. </p> <p> --That Washington was childless proved a great boon to his career. Because he had no heirs, Americans didn&#x2019;t worry that he might be tempted to establish a hereditary monarchy. And many religious Americans believed that God had deliberately deprived Washington of children so that he might serve as Father of His Country. </p> <p> --Though he tried hard to be fair and took excellent medical care of his slaves, Washington could be a severe master. His diaries reveal that during one of the worst cold snaps on record in Virginia&#x2014;when Washington himself found it too cold to ride outside&#x2014;he had his field slaves out draining swamps and performing other arduous tasks. </p> <p> --For all her anxiety about being constantly in a battle zone, Martha Washington spent a full half of the Revolutionary War with her husband&#x2014;a major act of courage that has largely gone unnoticed. </p> <p> --Washington was obsessed with his personal appearance, which extended to his personal guard during the war. Despite wartime austerity and a constant shortage of soldiers, he demanded that all members of his personal guard be between 5'8" and 5'10"; a year later, he narrowed the range to 5'9" to 5'10." </p> <p> --While Washington lost more battles than he won, he still ranks as a great general. His greatness lay less in his battlefield brilliance&#x2014;he committed some major strategic blunders&#x2014;than in his ability to hold his ragged army intact for more than eight years, keeping the flame of revolution alive. </p> <p> --Washington ran his own spy network during the war and was often the only one privy to the full scope of secret operations against the British. He anticipated many techniques of modern espionage, including the use of misinformation and double agents. </p> <p> --Washington tended his place in history with extreme care. Even amid wartime stringency, he got Congress to appropriate special funds for a full-time team of secretaries who spent two years copying his wartime papers into beautiful ledgers. </p> <p> --For thirty years, Washington maintained an extraordinary relationship with his slave and personal manservant William Lee, who accompanied him throughout the Revolutionary War and later worked in the presidential mansion. Lee was freed upon Washington&#x2019;s death and given a special lifetime annuity. </p> <p> --The battle of Yorktown proved the climactic battle of the revolution and the capstone of Washington&#x2019;s military career, but he initially opposed this Franco-American operation against the British&#x2014;a fact he later found hard to admit. </p> <p> --Self-conscious about his dental problems, Washington maintained an air of extreme secrecy when corresponding with his dentist and never used such incriminating words as &#x2018;teeth&#x2019; or &#x2018;dentures.&#x2019; By the time he became president, Washington had only a single tooth left&#x2014;a lonely lower left bicuspid that held his dentures in place. </p> <p> --Washington always displayed extremely ambivalence about his fame. Very often, when he was traveling, he would rise early to sneak out of a town or enter it before he could be escorted by local dignitaries. He felt beleaguered by the social demands of his own renown. </p> <p> --At Mount Vernon, Washington functioned as his own architect&#x2014;and an extremely original one at that. All of the major features that we associate with the house&#x2014;the wide piazza and colonnade overlooking the Potomac, the steeple and the weathervane with the dove of peace&#x2014;were personally designed by Washington himself. </p> <p> --A master showman with a brilliant sense of political stagecraft, Washington would disembark from his coach when he was about to enter a town then mount a white parade horse for maximum effect. It is not coincidental that there are so many fine equestrian statues of him. </p> <p> --Land-rich and cash-poor, Washington had to borrow money to attend his own inauguration in New York City in 1789. He then had to borrow money again when he moved back to Virginia after two terms as president. His public life took a terrible toll on his finances. </p> <p> --Martha Washington was never happy as First Lady&#x2014;a term not yet in use&#x2014;and wrote with regret after just six months of the experience: &#x201c;I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else...And as I cannot do as I like, I am obstinate and stay home a great deal.&#x201d; </p> <p> --When the temporary capital moved to Philadelphia in 1790, Washington brought six or seven slaves to the new presidential mansion. Under a Pennsylvania abolitionist law, slaves who stayed continuously in the state for six months were automatically free. To prevent this, Washington, secretly coached by his Attorney General, rotated his slaves in and out of the state without telling them the real reason for his actions. </p> <p> --Washington nearly died twice during his first term in office, the first time from a tumor on his thigh that may have been from anthrax or an infection, the second time from pneumonia. Many associates blamed his sedentary life as president for the sudden decline in his formerly robust health and he began to exercise daily. </p> <p> --Tired of the demands of public life, Washington never expected to serve even one term as president, much less two. He originally planned to serve for only a year or two, establish the legitimacy of the new government, then resign as president. Because of one crisis after another, however, he felt a hostage to the office and ended up serving two full terms. For all his success as president, Washington frequently felt trapped in the office. </p> <p> --Exempt from attacks at the start of his presidency, Washington was viciously attacked in the press by his second term. His opponents accused him of everything from being an inept general to wanting to establish a monarchy. At one point, he said that not a single day had gone by that he hadn&#x2019;t regretted staying on as president. </p> <p> --Washington has the distinction of being the only president ever to lead an army in battle as commander-in-chief. During the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, he personally journeyed to western Pennsylvania to take command of a large army raised to put down the protest against the excise tax on distilled spirits. </p> <p> --Two of the favorite slaves of George and Martha Washington&#x2014;Martha&#x2019;s personal servant, Ona Judge and their chef Hercules&#x2014;escaped to freedom at the end of Washington&#x2019;s presidency. Washington employed the resources of the federal government to try to entrap Ona Judge in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and return her forcibly to Virginia. His efforts failed. </p> <p> --Washington stands out as the only founder who freed his slaves, at least the 124 who were under his personal control. (He couldn&#x2019;t free the so-called &#x2018;dower slaves&#x2019; who came with his marriage to Martha.) In his will, he stipulated that the action was to take effect only after Martha died so that she could still enjoy the income from those slaves. </p> <p> --After her husband died, Martha grew terrified at the prospect that the 124 slaves scheduled to be freed after her death might try to speed up the timetable by killing her. Unnerved by the situation, she decided to free those slaves ahead of schedule only a year after her husband died. </p> <p> --Like her husband, Martha Washington ended up with a deep dislike of Thomas Jefferson, whom she called &#x201c;one of the most detestable of mankind.&#x201d; When Jefferson visited her at Mount Vernon before he became president, Martha said that it was the second worst day of her life&#x2014;the first being the day her husband died. </p> <p> (Photo of Ron Chernow � Nina Subin) </p> <p> </p><b>Ron Chernow&nbsp;</b>is the prizewinning author of six previous books and the recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal.

And beyond the world of war, business and management gurus have also applied Sun Tzu&#x2019;s ideas to office politics and corporate strategy. <br><br>Using a new translation by James Trapp and including editorial notes, this edition of The Art of War is printed on high quality paper and bound by traditional Chinese book-making techniques. It contains the full 13 chapters on such topics as laying plans, attacking by stratagem, weaponry, terrain and the use of spies. Sun Tzu addresses different campaign situations, marching, energy and how to exploit your enemy&#x2019;s weaknesses. Of immense influence to great leaders across millennia, The Art of War is a classic text richly deserving this exquisite edition.</p><p>James Trapp is the author of Chinese Characters: The Art and Meaning of Hanzi. A Chinese language graduate of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, he teaches Mandarin, is an Education Officer on the China Collection at the British Museum and worked for many years in Hong Kong as a dealer in Chinese art.&#x201c;With editorial notes and a new translation by James Trapp, this beautifully bound book is a must for any strategist or business man, or any everyday man that is looking for tips on how to rise to the top of whatever corporate or social ladder he is climbing&#x201d; (<i>City Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Complete Jewish Bible - Giant Print</h2><p>All new giant print edition, with large 16pt font, to make it easier to read.

Want to know how to navigate the forbidding maze of Social Security and emerge with the highest possible benefits? You could try reading all 2,728 rules of the Social Security system (and the thousands of explanations of these rules), but Kotlikoff, Moeller, and Solman explain Social Security benefits in an easy to understand and user-friendly style. What you don&#x2019;t know can seriously hurt you: wrong decisions about which Social Security benefits to apply for cost some individual retirees tens of thousands of dollars in lost income every year. How many retirees or those nearing retirement know about such Social Security options as file and suspend (apply for benefits and then don&#x2019;t take them)? Or start stop start (start benefits, stop them, then re-start them)?

Larry launched into a harangue, as he often does; this one was about Social Security&#x2019;s impossible complexity. Paul was listening, as usual, with his skeptical journalist&#x2019;s ear. Or, maybe, since it was Larry, just half-listening.<br> <br>Then Larry asked, How old were Paul and his wife and when were they planning to take their Social Security benefits?<br> <br>Proudly, Paul told Larry not to worry: he and his wife had it all figured out. They would both wait until 70, when Paul would get something like $40,000 a year instead of the $30,000 or so if he took his benefits at 66, his &#x201c;full&#x201d;&#x2014;but not &#x201c;maximum&#x201d;&#x2014;retirement age, which was coming right up. Paul had been reading and saving those annual green statements from the Social Security Administration for years with their &#x201c;Estimated Benefits.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been reading his wife&#x2019;s, too. As the family&#x2019;s financial planner, he knew just how much they were entitled to.<br> <br>But how old are you and Jan? Larry asked.<br> <br>What difference does it make? said Paul. Like I say, we&#x2019;re both waiting until 70.<br> <br>It makes a big difference, said Larry.<br> <br>Okay, Paul&#x2019;s wife would soon turn 66; he, 65.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s what you do, said Larry, never at a loss when it comes to speaking in the imperative. Jan should apply for her Social Security retirement benefit when she turned 66, but then &#x201c;suspend&#x201d; it. That is, she would make herself eligible for the benefit but wouldn&#x2019;t take it.<br> <br>Then, said Larry, when you (Paul) turn 66, you apply just for a spousal benefit. When you each hit 70, you do as originally planned&#x2014;you each take your own retirement benefits, at which point they will start at their highest possible values.<br> <br>Or, Larry continued, clearly thinking aloud, you apply and suspend at 66 and Jan begins taking the spousal benefit, since you earned more than she did, didn&#x2019;t you?<br> <br>Paul can be quite dismissive of what he considers Larry&#x2019;s flights of fantasy, Larry being the epitome of &#x201c;often overstated, but never in doubt.&#x201d; Yet Paul had begun to pay close attention. Having reported on business and economics on public television for decades, Paul understood the intricacies of business, finance, and economics better than most Americans (though admittedly, that may not be saying much). The exceptions, however, were the professional economists he&#x2019;d befriended in the course of his career. Larry was one of them, and among the most deeply versed in financial planning.<br> <br>Spousal benefits? Paul had vaguely heard of them. He had, however, never imagined he or his wife were eligible for any, though, had you asked him why not, he couldn&#x2019;t have told you.<br> <br>Spousal benefits for four years. That should be almost $50,000, Larry quickly estimated.<br> <br>An aside is in order here. Larry is a world-famous scold or, he will tell you, a dead-on Cassandra, with respect to Social Security&#x2019;s insolvency. Advising people like Paul to take extra benefits from the system while himself decrying the system&#x2019;s funding shortfall was not what Paul expected to hear. (More on that in Chapter 18.) But Larry believes it&#x2019;s not fair that some beneficiaries get more than others simply because they know the system&#x2019;s rules. And Paul and Phil agree with him.<br> <br>Fifty thousand dollars? Explain, Paul said.<br> <br>Well, if Jan&#x2019;s Social Security full retirement benefit were, say, $24,000, you&#x2019;d be eligible to get half that as a spousal benefit: about $12,000 a year. And if you get $12,000 a year from age 66 to age 70, that&#x2019;s $48,000. If, on the other hand, Jan takes the spousal benefit on your Social Security earnings record, she&#x2019;ll get more per year but for only three years instead of four, because she&#x2019;ll be 67 by the time you become eligible, only three years from 70. But still, that would mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. etc.<br> <br>However number-laden the trees, the forest was plain to see: there seemed to be an unambiguous strategy for maximizing benefits that Paul and Jan were eligible to collect, having contributed for decades, but had been entirely unaware of.<br> <br>If this is true, said Paul, I&#x2019;m buying you dinner. Anywhere in the world.<br> <br>Boston will do, said Larry, who also lives there. But there are dozens of really important details like this one. What we should really do (we&#x2019;re compressing here) is write a book. And we should include Phil Moeller, a retirement expert who&#x2019;s already spoken with me about such a project. He&#x2019;s been a financial journalist for years, and has written article after article for U.S. News &amp; World Report and Money about retirees who collectively leave tens of billions of dollars in Social Security benefits on the table by failing to claim everything to which they are entitled. Plus, Phil loves the Red Sox (although not as much as the Baltimore Orioles) and the New England Patriots.<br> <br>Fast-forward. Paul&#x2019;s wife came of age (66). She filed and suspended&#x2014;by phone. The person she talked to couldn&#x2019;t have been nicer. Paul came of age. He filed for a spousal benefit. The Social Security woman on the phone had never heard of file-and-suspend, checked with her supervisor, and came back on the line to thank him for enlightening her about a strategy she could now share with everyone who called. When they hit 70, both Paul and his wife called again, were again reprocessed&#x2014;graciously, competently, and within minutes, though his wife was nonplussed when asked if she&#x2019;d ever been a nun. And Paul has since taken Larry to dinner, and a pretty good dinner at that.<br><br><br> <br>SOCIAL SECURITY VERBATIM<br> <br>YOU&#x2019;RE RIGHT THERE (AND WE&#x2019;RE RIGHT HERE)<br> <br>&#x201c;The regulations that require a notice for an initial determination contemplate sending a correct notice. We consider that an initial determination is correct even if we send an incorrect notice.&#x201d;<br> <br>ALL QUOTES FROM OFFICIAL SOCIAL SECURITY RULES<br> <br> GET WHAT&#x2019;S YOURS&#x2014;AND YOU DON&#x2019;T EVEN HAVE TO BUY LARRY A MEAL<p></p> <br>We&#x2019;ve written this book to help people maximize the Social Security benefits they have earned and therefore, we believe, deserve to get. We three authors&#x2014;Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff, journalist and aging expert Phil Moeller, and PBS NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman&#x2014;have spent years studying the system and making it intelligible to the public.<br> <br>Why have we bothered to write this book?<br> <br>Because Social Security is, far and away, Americans&#x2019; most important retirement asset. And that&#x2019;s not only true for people of modest means. Middle-income and upper-income households actually have the most to gain, in total amounts, from getting Social Security right. Toting up lifetime benefits, even low-earning couples may be Social Security millionaires. And except for the Bill Gateses and Warren Buffetts of the world&#x2014;whose percentage of the population was exceedingly modest last we checked&#x2014;Social Security is a very meaningful income source.<br> <br>So, this book is for nearly every one of you who&#x2019;s ever earned a paycheck and wants every Social Security benefit dollar to which you are entitled&#x2014;entitled because you paid for it. You earned it. It&#x2019;s yours. It can even be yours if you never contributed a penny to the system but have or had a spouse, living or dead, who did. It may even be yours if you spent some of all of your career working for employers who did not have to participate in Social Security.<br> <br>Perhaps you wondered, when you got your first paycheck, what the huge deduction for that four-letter word &#x201c;FICA&#x201d; referenced. If you learned that it stood for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, you might have been none too pleased at first, but then assuaged by hearing that these &#x201c;contributions&#x201d;&#x2014;week after week, month after month, year after year, out of each and every paycheck (up to a limit)&#x2014;would lead to higher retirement benefits.<br> <br>Even those of us who aren&#x2019;t superrich, but have earned and saved a lot, view Social Security as a critical lifeline. We realize, after the Crash of 2008, that no assets&#x2014;not our homes, not our bonds, and certainly not our stocks&#x2014;are safe from life-altering declines. We realize that even our private pensions, if we have them, may hinge on our former employer staying in business and inflation not eroding the pension&#x2019;s purchasing power. (It&#x2019;s the rare private-sector pension that boosts payments to protect against inflation.) We also know that we could, with plausible breakthrough medical discoveries, live to 100 or longer.<br> <br>But isn&#x2019;t Social Security a bigger deal for the poor? Actually, it&#x2019;s not. To be sure, Social Security benefits are a crucial lifeline for lower-income beneficiaries. And, yes, Social Security benefits rise less for higher earners than do their FICA tax contributions. But benefits do rise with both time and earnings and they involve very big sums.<br> <br>Take, for example, a 60-year-old couple, who both stop working at that age, each partner having earned Social Security&#x2019;s taxable FICA limit&#x2014;the maximum taxable amount, starting at age 25. That maximum was $22,900 in wage income in 1979, when they began working; it&#x2019;s $118,500 for 2015, going up every year in lockstep with the nation&#x2019;s average wage increases. Running coauthor Larry&#x2019;s maximizemysocialsecurity.com software, a 60-year-old couple who earned at or above the payroll tax ceiling their entire lives would get $31,972 each or $63,944 a year collectively if they began taking benefits at 66, which is their Full Retirement Age (FRA). (We will have more to say about the FRA and other official Social Security terms in Chapter 3, and key terms like this one also are explained in the Glossary at the end of the book.) If they deferred benefits until age 70, they&#x2019;d get $42,203 ($84,406), which is 32 percent higher than their age 66 benefits, because for every year you wait, Social Security pays you a benefit that&#x2019;s 8 percent higher than the year before, even before its annual inflation adjustment.<br> <br>For such a couple, collecting Social Security at 62 represents a $1.2 million asset. In other words, you&#x2019;d need a nest egg of $1.2 million to produce the same amount of annual income that you&#x2019;ll get from Social Security, assuming you could safely earn 2 percent a year above inflation on your investments.<br> <br>Now, $1.2 million is more than many upper-middle-income retirees have saved by retirement age. The net worth of a typical household headed by someone aged 65 to 69 is only a fourth of this amount and much of it is in the value of their home. And all you have to do is stay alive and those Social Security payments will keep coming each and every month&#x2014;payments guaranteed by the United States government and protected against inflation. That&#x2019;s because every January, you get, by law, annual benefit raises that equal the prior year&#x2019;s rate of inflation.1<br> <br>Moreover, there is a huge amount of money at stake in maximizing one&#x2019;s Social Security benefits. The $1.2 million valuation, large as it is, actually assumes our 60-year-old couple makes the wrong Social Security benefit collection decisions. It assumes they take their retirement benefits as early as possible and forgo cashing in on what are, to them, free spousal benefits like the one Paul took. If they make the right decisions, they can increase the value of their lifetime Social Security &#x201c;asset&#x201d; by more than $400,000, to $1.6 million!<br> <br>This 33 percent increase may sound hard to believe, but it&#x2019;s true. The couple just needs to apply for the right benefits at the right time, as Larry advised Paul and Jan to do. Simple enough. But figuring out what to apply for and when to do it is not simple. Indeed, Social Security is the most complicated &#x201c;simple&#x201d; program you&#x2019;re ever likely to encounter.<br> <br>One more story, just to drive home the point of complexity. It comes from our Technical Expert, Jerry Lutz.<br> <br>One day, while Jerry still worked for Social Security, a claims representative approached him with a question. A new claimant&#x2019;s husband had died of a heart attack while they were having sex. They had been married for less than 9 months, the threshold for receiving survivor&#x2019;s benefits from Social Security. But one of the exceptions to the 9-month duration of marriage rule involves &#x201c;accidental death.&#x201d; Up until then, Jerry had considered &#x201c;accidental&#x201d; to mean something like a car wreck. But his job was to research tough cases like this one. So he searched the vast Social Security rule book and found POMS GN 00305.105, which describes an accidental death in part as follows:<br> <br>A &#x201c;bodily injury&#x201d; occurs whenever the outside force or cause affects the body sufficiently to interfere with its normal function.<br> <br>The cause of the bodily injury is:<br> <br>&#x201c;External&#x201d; if it originated outside the body. An external force can include an injury suffered due to weather conditions or exertion.<br> <br>NOTE: By exertion we mean an activity that involves at least moderate effort for the average person. Routine activities, e.g., standing, do not constitute exertion for purposes of finding accidental death. Circumstances which more readily lend themselves to a favorable finding of accidental death include:<br> <br>�&nbsp;an unexpected heart attack occurs during moderate exertion;<br> <br>�&nbsp;an unforeseen event negates the voluntary nature of an activity, e.g., an exercise machine breaks down while exercising;<br> <br>�&nbsp;some unintended, unexpected, and unforeseen result occurs during exertion, e.g., a fall or slip while running; or<br> <br>�&nbsp;a crisis or sudden peril requires strenuous exertion.<br> <br>&#x201c;Moderate exertion&#x201d;? Arguably. &#x201c;Unintended&#x201d; and &#x201c;unexpected&#x201d;? Indubitably. And so, based on the claimant&#x2019;s testimony and her husband&#x2019;s death certificate, widow&#x2019;s benefits were eventually conferred, but the determination was anything but simple.<br> <br>There are 10,000 baby boomers reaching retirement age every day. Each of them needs to know precisely how to get Social Security&#x2019;s best deal. But Paul&#x2019;s best moves&#x2014;or Larry&#x2019;s or Phil&#x2019;s, for that matter&#x2014;aren&#x2019;t necessarily yours. The Social Security system has 2,728 core rules and thousands upon thousands of additional codicils in its Program Operating Manual, which supposedly clarify those rules. In the case of married couples alone, the formula for each spouse&#x2019;s benefit comprises 10 complex mathematical functions, one of which is in four dimensions.<br> <br>This book contains minimal math, excepting the &#x201c;simple&#x201d; formula presented in this endnote.2 Rather, it explains in the simplest possible terms the traps to avoid and basic strategies to employ in maximizing a household&#x2019;s Social Security retirement, spousal, child, mother/father, survivor, divorcee, and disability benefits. That covers a whole lot of ground, which is why this book is about Social Security and nothing else. And why it&#x2019;s not as succinct as we (and you) might like.<br> <br>We will point out Social Security&#x2019;s windfalls and pitfalls&#x2014;explain obscure benefits and more obscure penalties; benefit collection strategies like file and suspend (applying for benefits, but not taking them) and start, stop, start (starting benefits, stopping them, and restarting them), which we bet most of you have never heard of. We&#x2019;ll also get into the details of Social Security&#x2019;s deemi...</p><h2>Shame the Stars</h2><p><p>Eighteen-year-old Joaquin del Toro's future looks bright.

Eighteen-year-olds Joaqu�n del Toro and Dulce�a Villa love each other; however, after their families fall out, they must resort to keeping their relationship a secret. The del Toros own a large estate with cattle and farmland and are friendly with Capt. Munro, the local leader of the Texas Rangers. The Villas own the print shop and are publishers of El Sure�o, the local periodical considered seditious by the town&#39;s authorities. Told from Joaqu�n&#39;s point of view, the novel spans three and a half years of corrupt agendas, power struggles, violence, racism, and loss. Scattered throughout are well-placed, nonitalicized Spanish words and phrases, both archival and fictional newspaper clippings, letters exchanged between hotheaded Joaqu�n and no-nonsense Dulce�a, and Joaqu�n&#39;s poetry-filled journal entries, personalizing and adding context to the overall political conflict. Far beyond a love story, the novel successfully tackles all kinds of hardship, including sexual violence and lynching; the historical conflict between the Rangers and the Tejanos feels uncannily contemporary. Women are the hidden heroes, because they must be, the hearts of both the revolution and the novel.

This has made <em>Plant Physiology</em> the most authoritative, comprehensive, and widely used upper-division plant biology textbook. In the Sixth Edition, the Growth and Development section (Unit III) has been reorganized and expanded to present the complete life cycle of seed plants from germination to senescence. In recognition of this enhancement, the text has been renamed<em></em> <em>Plant Physiology and Development</em>. As before, Unit III begins with updated chapters on <strong>Cell Walls </strong>and <strong>Signals and Signal Transduction</strong>. The latter chapter has been expanded to include a discussion of major signaling molecules, such as calcium ions and plant hormones. A new, unified chapter entitled <strong>Signals from Sunlight </strong>has replaced the two Fifth-Edition chapters on <strong>Phytochrome</strong> and <strong>Blue Light Responses</strong>. This chapter includes phytochrome, as well as the blue and UV light receptors and their signaling pathways, including phototropins, cryptochromes, and UVR8. The subsequent chapters in Unit III are devoted to describing the stages of development from embryogenesis to senescence and the many physiological and environmental factors that regulate them. The result provides students with an improved understanding of the integration of hormones and other signaling agents in developmental regulation.<br><br>The new organization of Unit III has the added benefit that it minimizes redundancy, making it possible to reduce the number of chapters in the Unit from 13 to 11. <strong>Angus Murphy </strong>of the University of Maryland has headed up a team of authors and editors to implement the revision. <strong>Ian Max M�ller </strong>has subsequently edited all the book chapters to ensure an even high quality and consistency level.<br><br>In addition to the organizational changes noted above, two new chapters on stress are included:<br><br>*A new chapter titled <strong>Biotic Interactions</strong>--replacing the Fifth-Edition Chapter 13 on <strong>Secondary Metabolites and Plant Defense</strong>--discusses the integrated signaling responses to a spectrum of biological agents.<br><br>*A completely rewritten chapter on <strong>Abiotic Stress</strong> discusses the use of genomics, systems biology, imaging, and bioinformatics tools in the study of abiotic stress. Recent efforts to develop drought-tolerant maize and flood-tolerant rice are described, as well as the role of ABA receptors, newly-identified regulatory networks, epigenetic changes in response to abiotic stress, and rapid systemic signaling.<br><br>The Sixth Edition of <em>Plant Physiology and Development </em>also includes updated and improved versions of the physiological chapters in Units I and II. A new chapter on <strong>Stomatal Biology </strong>has been added to Unit II. The chapters on <strong>Mineral Nutrition</strong> and <strong>Assimilation of Inorganic Nutrients</strong> feature a new treatment of nitrogen metabolism:<br><br>*Ammonium and nitrate are often lumped together as inorganic nitrogen although their influences on plants are quite different, almost like two different elements. These two forms of nitrogen are therefore treated separately in the Sixth Edition.<br><br>*The pathway of all nutrients essential in the human diet begins with plant roots "mining" the soil for mineral elements; the Sixth Edition explicitly examines the linkage between plant nutrition and human health.<br><br>*The response of plants to rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide depends most strongly on their nitrogen status. The Sixth Edition describes the newly discovered mechanism for this dependence and how it will influence food quality in the future.<br><br>*Exciting new findings on the mechanisms of mycorrhizal associations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation will be added, providing insights about the interdependence of plants and microorganisms.<br>The goal, as always, is to provide the best educational foundation possible for the next generation of plant biologists.<br><strong>RESOURCES</strong><br><br><em>For the Student</em><br><br>COMPANION WEBSITE<br>The <em>Plant Physiology and Development </em>Companion Website (available free of charge) includes a rich collection of material that enhances the textbook's coverage on a wide range of topics.

Yet it was Durkheim's reflections on morality and society that spoke most deeply of his vital concerns. In his informative introduction to this work, Robert N. Bellah describes Durkheim as moralist, philosopher, theologian, and prophet, as well as sociologist, and the selections in this volume are representative of these aspects of Durkheim's many-faceted scholarship.<br> <br> The first two selections of the volume set the context for the development of Durkheim's sociology of morality. Section I, "The French Tradition of Social Thought," gives Durkheim's picture of how his sociology is to be situated relative to the general French tradition. Section II, "Sociology and Social Action," shows Durkheim grappling with moral and political issues in his society and indicates the immediate social context of his thinking.<br> <br> The remaining selections indicate some of the major substantive areas of Durkheim's sociology of morality. Section III, taken from <i>The Division of Labor in Society</i>, demonstrates his basically evolutionary approach to the development of moral norms in society. Section IV, "The Learning of Morality," gives examples of Durkheim's work on socialization. Section V, "Social Creativity," deals with the important question of how new moral norms arise in society.<br></p></p><p>The first two sections of this volume set the context for the development of Durkheim&#39;s sociology of morality.

Swearing off cartooning as a profession, Tsuge takes on a series of unconventional jobs -- used camera salesman, ferryman, and stone collector -- hoping to find success among the hucksters, speculators, and deadbeats he does business with.<br><br>Instead, he fails again and again, unable to provide for his family, earning only their contempt and his own. The result is a dryly funny look at the pitfalls of the creative life, and an off-kilter portrait of modern Japan. Accompanied by an essay from translator Ryan Holmberg that discusses Tsuge's importance in comics and Japanese literature, <i>The Man Without Talent</i> is one of the great works of comics literature.</p><p><b>Yoshiharu Tsuge</b> is a cartoonist and essayist known best for his surrealistic, avant-garde work. Tsuge began drawing comics in 1955, working primarily in the rental comics industry that was popular in impoverished post-war Japan. In the 1960s, Tsuge was discovered by the publishers of the avante garde comics magazine Garo and he gained increasing recognition for his surrealistic and introspective work. He withdrew from Garo in the 1970s and his work became more autobiographical. Tsuge has not published cartoons since the late 1980s, elevating him to cult status in Japan.

It looks at the roots of emotion, intelligence, and creativity, translating the most current scientific research into practical suggestions for parents and teachers. <br><br>Dr. Healy also addresses academic learning, offering countless suggestions for how parents can help without pushing. She explains the building blocks of reading, writing, spelling, and mathematics and shows how to help youngsters of all ages develop motivation, attention, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. <br><br>Using the science of childhood development, she also examines today&#x2019;s hot issues, including learning disabilities, ADHD, influences of electronic media, and the hazards of forced early learning. From infancy to adolescence, this is the perfect guide to helping and enjoying a youngster&#x2019;s mental, personal, and academic growth.</p><p><b>JANE M. HEALY, Ph.D., </b>is an educational psychologist and teacher who has worked with students from preschool through graduate school. She consults and lectures worldwide, helping teachers and parents understand the educational implications of current brain research. She has appeared on national media such as the<i> Today </i>show, <i>Nightline, Good Morning America,</i> CNN, and NPR. A mother and grandmother, she currently lives in Vail, Colorado.Chapter 1<br>Opening the "Black Box"<br>One evening some years ago, I received a call from a young teacher whom I hadn't seen since she had left school on maternity leave. We had often talked about her hopes and plans for the baby, but tonight she sounded worried.<br><br>"Jane, I'm sorry to call you at home, but I just have to ask for some advice about Tony. He seems very advanced, and I'm doing all the things we talked about--playing with him, talking to him, reading to him--but this neighbor of mine has just signed up for a course that advertises ways to raise her child's IQ by increasing his brain development. Should I be doing more? Can parents really help build their kids' brains?"<br><br>Amy's call didn't surprise me, since over the years I have gotten the same question in many forms. The pressure on parents becomes more intense all the time. They come to my office wanting to do a "perfect" job despite the constraints of busy schedules, but they are confused by conflicting theories about child development and by omnipresent advertising for products that claim to make children smarter sooner. Confusion and guilt are inevitable: Am I doing enough? How much and what kind of enrichment does a preschooler need? What is the best way to teach reading and math--and what if my child is having difficulty? Should parents help with schoolwork? Can creativity be developed? How can we act as a child's advocate if school personnel aren't attuned to individual needs? What, really, is "attention deficit disorder"? How can we make kids more motivated? What about the child who doesn't "fit the mold"?<br><br>These questions have never been easy ones, but now the science of developmental neuropsychology, integrating brain research with children's behavior and learning, offers some answers. We know more about learning, individual differences in abilities, and emotional development than we did even five years ago. Although no two human brains are alike and no one set of answers is right for every child, new information can help teachers do a better job and assist parents in making wise decisions--while confirming the innate wisdom of their own best instincts. An incident much earlier in my career makes me realize just how far we have come.<br><br>I met nine-year-old Aaron when he tripped over me as he was entering his science class. As a visiting consultant, I was trying to be invisible, and apparently I had succeeded as far as Aaron was concerned. I began to suspect that this waifish-looking little fellow had a problem when he next bumped into the doorway, scattering a mass of smudged work sheets whose mangled manuscript letters would be an embarrassment to most six-year-olds and which bore the indelible marks of teacher rejection: "Messy!" "F." Ignoring my mission to evaluate the science curriculum, I watched him struggle to organize himself around a desk, dropping his pencil and fumbling through a tattered folder for misplaced homework. A discussion of space exploration immediately attracted his attention, and his skinny arm gyrated in the air, once more knocking his pencil, unnoticed, from the desk. Recognized at last by the teacher, he delivered a stunning exposition of rocket trajectories, fuel needs, and relative astral distances.<br><br>I couldn't resist asking the principal about Aaron. "Has he ever had a neurodevelopmental evaluation? It sure looks as if something is misfiring when he tries to translate his good ideas into action."<br><br>"Oh, no," he said. "Poor kid has an emotional problem. He's being treated by a psychiatrist. Believe it or not, he still wets his bed! His mother rejected him emotionally when he was born, and he's always had difficulty with schoolwork even though we can tell he's smart."<br><br>"Well, you might consider looking further," I ventured. I was quite sure Aaron had some problems that predated the emotional ones, but I was there to evaluate curriculum, not to do diagnosis.<br><br>Six months later I received a note in the mail from a woman who identified herself as Aaron's mother. "Thanks to your intervention," she said ("intervention," indeed!), "we took Aaron to a clinic and found that he has had a problem since birth in one of the important lower brain centers." Since the area she described is part of a system responsible for voluntary control of motor movements such as writing, avoiding bumping into people and doorways, and yes, even bladder control, it is not surprising that Aaron was having problems despite an IQ in the superior range. "Now we understand that he isn't lazy or stupid, and he will get special help with this problem," she went on to say. "If you only knew the guilt and the anguish we have been through, you would understand why I am so grateful."<br><br>I keep that note, not only because it is the only effortless success story of my career, but also because it is a perfect example of the "black box" view of the brain that prevailed for so long: "If we can't see inside, we'll ignore it." "Emotional problems" became the handiest scapegoat whenever things weren't going well. The unfortunate result became a "blame game" in which the parents, school, and even the child were accused of responsibility for problems in learning. We have come a long way, but the "blame game" is still around--for parents, for children with learning differences, for some whose environments shortchanged them early in life, and too often for educators who can't force unprepared or unready neural systems to mature on a set timetable.<br>Looking Inside<br>Various forms of brain research have been conducted for centuries, but the field has experienced an avalanche of new information since the development of electronic methods of observing and measuring brain activity. Harmless ways of looking directly at the brain in action help teach us about why learning happens--or fails to. The major methods of looking inside utilize either caps of electrodes or computerized scanners. Mapping the brain's electrical activity shows how actively and how quickly brain areas respond to a stimulus; different kinds of scanners display the structure of the brain or the way it functions during normal activities, such as reading or working mental problems. Because these technologies are still difficult to use in real-life situations (in a scanner, for example, the child must lie still for an extended period of time), their findings are combined with behavioral observation and good educational and developmental research to get a bigger picture.<br><br>From another angle, work with "artificial intelligence" has also sparked research on how the human brain functions, giving scientists new respect for the capabilities and complexity of even a toddler's brain as they try--and fail--to duplicate human learning abilities, such as building a block tower. Computer brains are terribly good at some things, but terribly bad at others--such as creativity, understanding the nuances of language, or practical problem-solving. Nor can they compete with human caregivers in providing "scaffolds" for a child's social, emotional, and cognitive growth.<br><br>The purpose of this book is to bring you up to date by explaining what science has discovered and how we can apply it in real-life situations at home or school. I will be drawing on research in a wide variety of fields and on a background of professional and personal experience. I hope you will also feel empowered to use your own common sense! In this chapter we will introduce two major questions central to the book: Where does brainpower come from, and what can we do about it? The following chapters will apply this basic information to different age groups and to specific aspects of personal development, learning fundamentals, and academic achievement.<br>BRAINPOWER: UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS<br>Overview: Brain Structure vs. Function<br>Frank Lloyd Wright, the famous architect, is said to have used the phrase "form follows function" to make the point that the way a structure is to be used should determine the way it gets shaped. This principle definitely holds true for the human brain. The way your children--or students--use their brains will help determine the shape and power of neural connections.<br><br>The basic structure of the brain--its architecture--is composed mainly of cells called neurons and their supporting cells. Its function, on the other hand, is a dynamic process that involves the way these neurons communicate through electrical and chemical signaling. As relays between cells are repeatedly made, they create complex physical networks of connections--which in turn become part of the structure of the brain. In this sense the brain is "plastic," literally shaping itself according to what it responds to.<br>Where Does It Come From?: Heredity and Environment<br>"I'm not surprised that Sally is having trouble with math." Her mother, Mrs. Strang, was apologetic. "I was hopeless in math even though I was a good student otherwise." Sally, now a fifth grader who had just won the school spelling contest, was struggling mightily with her math assignments, particularly those involving "story" problems, charts and graphs, and geometric forms. We decided to ask Sally's math teacher to work individually with her after school, and her mother agreed that they would practice together at home with some materials designed to improve concepts of space relationships. As Mrs. Strang left my office, I noticed that she first turned in the wrong direction before she started down the hall, and I recalled a much earlier conversation in which she confided that she didn't let Sally climb trees for fear she would hurt herself.<br><br>Did Sally inherit her math problem? Did she pick it up from poor teaching? Can we blame it on a lack of experience with physical and space relationships in her early years? How about her best friend, Megan, who started to read and calculate when she was three and gets straight As with very little effort? Was she born smart or did her parents do something right? Should we switch the "blame game" to parental genes?<br><br>Does heredity ("nature") or environment ("nurture") play the major role in development? There is such a constant interaction between basic capacity and experience from the moment of a baby's conception that the question is impossible--and really unnecessary--to answer. Every child inherits a physical brain structure and a timetable for development as well as chemical and electrical response patterns that strongly influence its functioning. A child's personal tempo--the natural pace of responding and the speed of carrying out activities--also seems to be genetically determined.<br><br>Other inherited dimensions of personality have their roots in the brain, such as introversion or extroversion. Some children are shyer, while others are more outgoing and people-oriented from the beginning, behaviors that reflect activation in opposite sides of the brain in new or challenging situations. An easy or difficult disposition related to the balances of brain chemicals may also come with the package. The tendency to act impulsively, linked to the function of a specific area of the front part of the brain, seems to be present in some families, although you will learn later how envionments affect this behavioral style. Family patterns for the timetable of physical and intellectual development make some children pass through the stages of growth more quickly than others, although more rapid maturation does not necessarily predict a better final outcome.<br><br>Certain constellations of abilities, such as music, engineering, or literary talent, seem to cluster in some families; there are also some types of learning problems, such as developmental dyslexia, which are hereditary and involve specific differences in brain structure and function. Nevertheless, in the case of dyslexia, the language environment at home and the type of reading instruction a child gets can determine the severity of the problem and even how the brain functions during reading.<br><br>Studies of identical twins, who have identical genes, have also demonstrated the inherited stability of some aspects of intelligence even when the twins are raised separately. Since many different genes are involved in intellectual ability, it is not easy to pin down this complex phenomenon. Some severe psychological problems, such as depression or schizophrenia, also have a genetic component (both structural and biochemical differences have been found in these brains), although identical twins often differ in whether they become schizophrenic, suggesting involvement of environmental factors as well.<br>A Two-Way Street<br>The child's personality and response style also help determine the way he gets treated by those around him. Some children are just plain "difficult," and some are harder for parents to relate to because they are temperamentally very different from the rest of the family. Naturally, their behavior increases the stress, and thus affects the response, of the adults in their life. No doubt Aaron was one of these youngsters. Understanding the problem enables us to help such children while making the parent's role an easier one.<br><br>What accounts for Sally's math problem? Undoubtedly a combination of factors. Rather than trying to pin responsibility on genes or early experiences, our job is to appreciate her particular way of learning and provide new experiences to enhance it. In short, neuropsychologists tell us that the human brain comes into the world programmed for certain aspects of learning and behavior, but many of these are susceptible to alteration.<br><br>Now, as a prelude to understanding what we can do about helping children develop their own brainpower, let us turn to some basic ideas about how the brain is structured, how it functions and grows, and how it directs learning.<br>THE DEVELOPING BRAIN<br>A Tough Start<br>One of my most poignant recent experiences involved kids who experienced a really tough start in life. I was invited to present a workshop at a conference hosted by an international group of parents of adopted Romanian orphans. The plight of these youngsters has been well-publicized, as it is one of the most appalling examples of child neglect and abuse ever uncovered. Committed to grossly understaffed orphanages by desperately poor parents, these children were fed gruel out of bottles and confined in cribs--sometimes for years. Many lacked even minimal interaction with adults or peers, physical or emotional stimulation, language, toys, or any of the other necessities we normally take for granted.<br><br>These cases have provided a tragic study in the developmental consequences of early deprivation. Indeed, depending on the age of adoption and the child's condition at that time, it appears that some aspects of brain functioning may have been compromised beyond recovery. On the other hand, as I made my way to conference sessions through a playful and energetic bunch of kids and parents, I was astonished at the amount of recovery that had obviously taken place. The parents I met, as a group, were singularly devoted to these children; many had provided countless hours and varieties of expert remediation--in some cases starting almost from scratch. Most important, of course, they had also provided vast quantities of love and emotional support--a most inspiring group of people!<br><br>I was particularly struck by the parents' reports that, although many of the children were struggling with various types of learning problems, many had overcome major cognitive obstacles. The main barrier to "catch-up" was in the social and emotional realm--particularly the ability to relate effectively with loved ones or friends. Whether or not some of these youngsters will ever be able to overcome that handicap is an unanswered question, since there are "critical periods...</p><h2>Last Breath: (Detective Erika Foster) (Volume 4)</h2><p><p><b>He&#x2019;s your perfect date.

Jacobs, Ph. D.,</b> is an insomnia specialist at the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. As a senior scientist at Harvard's Mind/Body Medical Institute and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he spent almost twenty years treating and researching insomnia.Say Good Night To Insomnia<br>PART IGetting Started1You Can Say Good Night to InsomniaBedtime is approaching and Alan is dreading it. He knows what tonight will bring: the torment of another night of insomnia.Each night has become agonizingly familiar. Exhausted, Alan gets into bed and turns out the lights to go to sleep, only to lie wide awake. The harder he tries to fall asleep, the more he tosses and turns and the more tense and frustrated he feels. With the realization that he can't fall asleep comes a distressing wave of anxiety and stressful thoughts about sleep--"I've got to get some sleep or I'll never function tomorrow!"--and the worries about the problems in his life: tomorrow's meeting, Friday's deadline, his company's downsizing, his mother's illness. All are made worse by the loneliness and darkness of the night.Even when Alan finally falls asleep he cannot escape insomnia. After just a few hours, he wakes up and tosses and turns before falling back to sleep just as the sun rises.When the alarm clock rings, Alan has to drag himself out of bed, angry and depressed in the knowledge that yet another day feeling wiped out, helpless, and desperate awaits him.Insomnia has become Alan's living nightmare.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Does Alan's ordeal sound familiar? It does for most insomniacs, who live in an interminable state of anxiety concerning insomnia and its effects on their lives. Like Alan, they also feel hopeless, powerless, and trapped by their lack of control over sleep, and they dread what, for most people, is an enjoyable experience--going to bed.And no wonder. The anger, exhaustion, and irritability caused by insomnia can handicap mood, productivity, coping skills, and family and social life, and deprive insomniacs of a sense of joy and well-being. They grow even more frustrated or depressed by family or friends who tell them "it's all in your head" or "just relax," and may start to wonder whether they have a "psychological" problem. As a consequence, insomniacs feel embarrassed or even ashamed about their condition, which diminishes their self-esteem.Doctors and Sleeping PillsIt is stressful enough to endure insomnia, but many doctors' reactions to it can make it even worse. They frequently don't ask about insomnia, overlook it, or simply ignore it. Why? Because insomnia is so ubiquitous that it is often dismissed by doctors as an unavoidable and normal part of life!Doctors are not trained to diagnose or treat insomnia. Even though it is one of the most frequent health complaints today, doctors receive less than one hour of training on sleep problems during their entire medical education. This lack of training is compounded by the fact that, until recently, little federal funding has been allocated for insomnia research, which means that information about treating insomnia is not available to doctors in medical and scientific journals. (Fortunately, Congress and the National Institutes of Health have started to appropriate more money for sleep and insomnia research, as evidenced by the decision to fund my own research for four years.)It is easy to understand why doctors are not comfortable treating insomnia. And when they are not comfortable treating something, they are inclined to avoid it. As Dr. William Dement, an internationalexpert on sleep disorders and director of the Sleep Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine, explains, "Most physicians dread the arrival of a chronic insomnia patient. If one asks a large group of doctors if any of them enjoy managing chronic insomnia, not a single hand will go up." It is no wonder that the vast majority of cases of insomnia go undiagnosed and untreated!There is another reason insomniacs can't turn to their doctor for help: medicine has not developed an effective treatment for insomnia. Until recently, the only medical treatments available were sleeping pills such as Halcion, Restoril, Dalmane, Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and many others. Sleeping pills, however, are no longer considered a safe or appropriate treatment for chronic insomnia because they can have serious side effects that far outweigh their benefits; are only moderately effective for insomnia and stop working over time; strengthen the belief that the cure for insomnia comes from external factors; and can lead to physical or psychological dependency, which can cause feelings of helplessness, loss of control, and lowered self-esteem.Most important, <i>sleeping pills don't cure insomnia, because they don't treat the causes of insomnia.</i> Consequently, if you rely on sleeping pills, your sleep may improve while you take the pills, but as soon as you stop, your insomnia will return, thereby sustaining the cycle of insomnia and sleeping pills.Given everything we know about the drawbacks to sleeping pills, why do so many doctors still prescribe them? Partly because when doctors are busy and don't know what to do about insomnia, sleeping pills are a fast and easy solution. Another reason is the pervasive influence of drug companies, which sponsor scientific conferences, advertise in medical journals, send sales personnel to doctors' offices, supply free samples of sleep medications, and fund research studies that pay part of doctors' salaries. Therefore, doctors may be subtly influenced to prescribe the sleeping pills that the drug companies manufacture.Doctors also prescribe sleeping pills because of the predominant attitude in medicine today that drugs are the best treatment for health problems. This drug-oriented approach, which focuses on treating the body, has worked well for acute and infectious illnesses.However, it has been largely ineffective in the treatment of today's chronic health problems such as stroke, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, insomnia, chronic pain, and mental illness, in which emotional, behavioral, and lifestyle factors play a prominent role.Psychotherapy and Over-the-Counter Sleep AidsNot surprisingly, 85 percent of insomniacs never seek medical help. Insomnia has become an epidemic affecting desperate, silent sufferers who, believing that their doctors can't help them or will prescribe habit-forming prescription sleeping pills, have been left to fend for themselves, typically spending years battling the problem futilely and suffering needlessly.You may be one of the many insomniacs who have turned to expensive, time-consuming psychotherapy in your belief, or perhaps your doctor's, that insomnia is caused by "psychological problems." Not only does this belief induce feelings of helplessness and diminished self-esteem; there also is no scientific proof that psychotherapy is effective for insomnia, in large part because the majority of insomniacs do not have a psychiatric problem such as anxiety or depression. This is why trying to treat insomnia as a problem caused by psychiatric factors is destined to fail and only contributes to the stigma of insomnia being a "psychiatric" problem.Millions of other insomniacs have turned to a slew of new over-the-counter nighttime sleep aids such as Tylenol PM, Excedrin PM, and Anacin PM, whose manufacturers have capitalized on this epidemic. These products, cloaked in the brand names of trusted medicines, avoid the stigma associated with prescription sleeping pills. Consequently, they are one of the fastest-growing classes of health care products today, with sales soaring to over $100 million in 1992. Yet, in truth, there is no scientific evidence that these medications are any more effective than a sugar pill!Like prescription sleeping pills, over-the-counter sleeping aids can have unwanted side effects, lose effectiveness over time, and bolsterthe belief that the cure for insomnia comes from something external, which can foster psychological dependency and feelings of helplessness. Most important, these sleep aids don't cure insomnia because they don't treat the causes. Therefore, if you stop taking over-the-counter sleep aids, your insomnia will return.Insomniacs spent an additional $200 million annually on one recent self-help craze for insomnia: melatonin. Health fads are nothing new, but rarely does one strike with the force of "melatonin madness," which hit its peak in 1995. Advertised at drugstores with signs proclaiming WE HAVE MELATONIN and extolled by the media and national magazines and books as the cure-all for insomnia, melatonin has also been trumpeted as a cure for heart disease, diabetes, depression, and aging. Demand for melatonin was so high that for almost a year vendors had a hard time keeping it in stock.As we will see, however, the exaggerated claims about melatonin's benefits for insomniacs go far beyond established scientific evidence. It turns out that these claims are based on only a few selected studies, one of which was conducted by a scientist who owns a company that sells melatonin. What insomniacs do not know is that there are just as many studies showing that melatonin has no consistent beneficial effect on insomnia. Consequently, the public has been given an unbalanced picture about the present state of knowledge concerning melatonin, knowledge that is woefully incomplete. Therefore, if you are using melatonin, you are assuming unknown risks.Why are insomniacs willing to spend money on melatonin and gamble their health on unproven claims about its effects on sleep? Probably because melatonin is available over the counter, is inexpensive, is promoted as "natural" (lead is also natural, yet can be dangerous), and because the lure of a fast and easy panacea for insomnia is irresistible.Although melatonin may ultimately prove to be effective for some insomniacs, you are risking your health by using it. You are also relying on something external, which only leads to dependency. And because melatonin, like all drugs, does not treat the causes of insomnia, your insomnia will return if you stop taking it.A Breakthrough in the Treatment of InsomniaThe only true hope for insomnia sufferers is the development of a safe, natural, and effective drug-free treatment that addresses the causes of insomnia. This program has not existed--until now.Based on ten years of research and clinical practice that I have conducted at Harvard Medical School, the groundbreaking program presented in this book is the <i>only</i> drug-free program scientifically proven to conquer insomnia. The results are extraordinary: 100 percent of insomnia patients report improved sleep and 75 percent become normal sleepers as a result of this program; improved sleep is seen to be maintained or even enhanced at long-term follow-up; and insomniacs fall asleep faster using this program than using sleeping pills.The program is also natural, easy to learn, and practical. It has no side effects, yields results that last, optimizes empowerment and self-control by demonstrating that the cure for insomnia resides within you, enhances mind-body control, and improves health and well-being.Why This Program Is DifferentMy insomnia program achieves its remarkable results because it is based on a simple yet powerful concept: <i>insomnia can only be treated by addressing all the underlying causes.</i> In most instances, the causes of insomnia are thoughts and behaviors (habits) that are learned and can be unlearned. Some examples include:� Attitudes and beliefs about sleep� Negative, stressful thoughts about insomnia� Feelings of loss of control over sleep� Inadequate exercise or exposure to sunlight� Going to bed too early or sleeping too late� Trying to control sleep rather than letting it occur naturally� Negative responses to stress� Lying awake in bed, frustrated and tenseThe following story, about one of my patients, illustrates the idea that insomnia is caused by thoughts and behaviors. Does her experience sound familiar?&nbsp;<br>Carol was a forty-seven-year-old nurse whose insomnia began after the death of a close friend. After experiencing sleeplessness for a few weeks, she started to worry about it, which only made it harder for her to sleep. Carol also began "trying" to fall asleep, which backfired and made her more wide awake, tense, and frustrated.After a month of sleepless nights, Carol began to expect that she wouldn't sleep, which caused her to fear going to bed. Although Carol had exercised for years, she became so fatigued from insomnia that she stopped exercising. She also began to try to catch up on sleep by spending more time in bed and sleeping late on weekends, all of which seemed to make her sleep worse.Carol became so desperate that she began drinking a glass of wine or taking a sleeping pill to fall sleep, both of which disturbed the quality of her sleep and made her feel guilty and out of control. Her preoccupation with sleep, coupled with the stress of diminished performance at work, only compounded her insomnia. It wasn't long before Carol began to wonder if something was wrong with her mind and whether she should visit a psychiatrist.By the time Carol came to see me, she was sleeping less than five hours per night and had been experiencing insomnia for several years. As a result, she always felt exhausted and irritable and was becoming depressed. She perceived her bed as the "enemy" and wondered whether she would ever sleep well again.Carol then entered my Insomnia Program at Deaconess Hospital. After just a few days in the program, her sleep started to improve. After six weeks, she eliminated sleeping pills, fell asleep easily, and stayed asleep. As a result, she was able to sleep over eight hours per night, awakened refreshed, and "loved her bed again." She also felt more empowered, more confident, and had more control over her mind and body. Even Carol's husband remarked that she was like a new person!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Larry was another patient who came to my program suffering from insomnia. He was a fifty-year-old attorney whose insomnia began during law school. Although Larry could fall asleep easily, he frequently awoke during the night and would lie awake for hours. When Larry came to see me, he had been experiencing insomnia for more than five years and was sleeping about four hours per night, leaving him feeling wiped out, frustrated, and desperate.After two weeks in my program, Larry slept through the night for the first time in years. By the time he completed the program, he was sleeping nearly seven hours per night and was able to fall asleep again easily if he woke up. Larry was calmer, more energetic, and more productive during the day and also felt more control over his emotions and health.&nbsp;<br>Carol and Larry achieved their remarkable success by learning a variety of nondrug techniques:� Viewing insomnia as a learned problem that can be unlearned� Changing negative, stressful thoughts about sleep� Managing stress more effectively� Eliciting the relaxation response, an inborn biological response that allowed them to voluntarily produce the brain-wave patterns that induce sleep� Using the power and biology of positive beliefs about sleep� Strengthening the brain's sleep rhythm by reducing excessive time in bed and getting out of bed at the same time every day� Receiving exposure to bright sunlight and exercising at specific times of the day</p><h2>Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party</h2><p>An account of the ill-fated overland journey of a group of pioneers who set out for California in 1846</p><p>GEORGE R.

When William Morris founded the Kelmscott Press in 1890, he combined his medieval craft ideals with his skills as one of Britain's most sophisticated, progressive designers. He achieved his goal &#x2014; the creation of books as beautiful as those of the Middle Ages &#x2014; by abandoning many of the commercial practices of his day. Morris designed types of great elegance and reintroduced color into the body of the page, adding life to the printed word.<br>Even if there were enough copies for everyone who wanted one, the cost of original Kelmscott books is prohibitively expensive. For this reason, Dover Publications has reissued one of Morris's most noteworthy books in a photographic facsimile that retains the enchantment of the original edition. More than an exquisitely produced book, <i>The Wood Beyond the World</i> ranks among the finest of Morris's prose-romances, a wonderful fantasy in a medieval setting, brimming with high adventure and flights of fancy. This superbly illustrated novel was among the first to combine reality and the supernatural, and it served as inspiration for J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and countless other fantasists. <br></p></p><p><p> A groundbreaking fantasy novel, <em>The Wood Beyond the World</em> tells the story of a young man, Golden Walter, who finds himself in a strange and frightening world after being abandoned by his wife and lost at sea. The novel takes the form of Walter&#x2019;s quest for the visionary Maid that he sees at the beginning of his journey, and takes him from his failed marriage through temptation to emotional fulfillment. Set in Morris&#x2019;s imaginative recreation of a medieval world, the novel is full of vivid imagery and surprising emotional realism. </p> <p> This edition collates for the first time the three early texts of the work. The introduction discusses the place of the book among Morris&#x2019;s other prose romances, the events of his life, and his activities as a visual artist and a socialist. The appendices provide excerpts from Morris&#x2019;s translation of <em>Beowulf</em>, other medieval texts read by Morris, and writings by his contemporaries on politics and aesthetics. </p>Polymath William Morris (1834&#x2013;96) was a prolific writer of novels and essays as well as a translator of medieval texts. Although best known in his lifetime as a poet, Morris is chiefly remembered today for his designs, which he issued from his highly successful decorative arts firm. He also founded the Kelmscott Press, which he dedicated to the hand-printing of a select number of beautiful books.</p><h2>Jeeves in the Offing</h2><p>Bertie is faced with a murky situation which, had Jeeves been at his side, he would doubtless have taken in his stride.

He was highly popular throughout a career that lasted more than seventy years, and his many writings continue to be widely read. He is best known for his novels and short stories of Bertie Wooster and his manservant Jeeves and for his settings of English upper-class society of the pre- and post-World War I era. He lived in several countries before settling in the United States after World War II.

They are both much in demand for events for children at schools, libraries and literary festivals.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;In this sequel to <i>The Gruffalo</i> (Dial, 1999), the wide-eyed daughter of that story's title character decides to find the "Big Bad Mouse" that her father has told her so much about. "His eyes are like pools of terrible fire,/and his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire." With her stick doll tucked under her arm, the youngster enters the deep, dark woods and follows marks in the snow to snake, owl, and fox. When she finally finds a little mouse, she grabs him for a feast, but the clever creature tricks her into running away to the comfort of her sleeping father's arms. The full-color cartoons portray a suitably sympathetic child in the snow-filled woods. While children may appreciate the details (the stick doll, snake tracks in the snow, gruffalo child's cave drawings) in the art, lack of change from picture to picture and in perspective diminish its effectiveness.

Within the pages of that book, certain truths were revealed about Lyndon Johnson's persona; they were characteristics that are only briefly acknowledged and forgotten, if noted at all, in other biographies of him. The conclusions reached in that book become the premise upon which this one is based. Although it does contain certain brief observations about his years as president, the focus of the earlier book was the assassination of President Kennedy; now the focus shifts, and we turn our attention to how Johnson's personal conduct became the imprint of his administration as he propelled the country, through pure mania, through five of the most turbulent years ever experienced by the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>[From the Epilogue]</b><br> [W]e are now left to ponder how the course of history and the evolution of the American culture might have progressed had we been spared the trauma of the Vietnam War and the other bizarre, bewildering, and inexplicable actions taken during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson that led to the most divisive and tumultuous period--one induced intentionally, and primarily to bolster the president's own narrow political and financial interests--in American history. While there is no way of knowing precisely how the United States "might have been" had Lyndon Johnson never become president, it is clear that his known "drunken driving" habit deeply affected the country and<br> its direction over the last fifty years. Because of the swerving five-year test drive, as the drunken President Lyndon Johnson figuratively drove the country into the ditch--just as he had literally done with a number of government-owned automobiles at his ranch--it has taken decades for his successors to try to restore the nation's confidence and conscience, made all the more difficult because of their own secrets that had to be hidden<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>How Lyndon B.

Her parents, however, soon resurface. Her handsome father is a hard-drinking screenwriter who is, for young Paula, "part ally, part betrayer." Her mother is given to icy bursts of temper that punctuate a deep indifference. How, Fox wonder, is this woman "enough of an organic being to have carried me in her belly"?<br><br>Never sharing more than a few moments with his daughter, Fox's father allows her to be shunted from New York City, where she lives with her passive Spanish grandmother, to Cuba, where she roams freely on a relative's sugar-cane plantation, to California, where she finds herself cast upon Hollywood's grubby margins. The thread binding these wanderings is the "borrowed finery" of the title-a few pieces of clothing, almost always lent by kind-hearted strangers, that offer Fox a rare glimpse of permanency.<br><br>Vivid and poetic, <i>Borrowed Finery</i> is an unforgettable book which will swell the legions of Paula Fox's devoted admiriers.<br></p><p>In this elegant, wrenching memoir, Paula Fox looks at her childhood with the same detached acceptance of life's arbitrary cruelties that informs such acclaimed novels as <i>Desperate Characters</i>. Born in 1923, she was abandoned at a Manhattan foundling home by her alcoholic father at the insistence of her panic-stricken, 19-year-old mother. Paul and Elsie Fox were in no way prepared to take on the responsibility of a child, although they couldn't leave her alone either. Fox's austere narrative unflinchingly describes the couple swooping down on their daughter, who was being raised in upstate New York by a kindly minister, for visits that were as alarming as they were intermittent. For reasons best known to themselves (Fox does not attempt to analyze their motives), they removed her from the minister's home when she was 6, then bounced her among relatives, schools, and their own disordered care for the next 12 years, from Hollywood and Long Island to Cuba and Montreal. The restraint with which Fox describes these traumas is a reproach to all those maudlin memoirs of family dysfunction that have been so prevalent in recent years. She demonstrates that you can write about painful experiences honestly without wallowing in self-pity, and her prose here is as perfectly calibrated as it is in her novels. Thank goodness that this sad story is leavened by a running counterpoint of short passages showing young Paula discovering the pleasure of words and the power of literature. Though she too had an unwanted baby at an early age, the book closes with a moving scene of the author's reunion with the daughter she gave up for adoption. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Paula Fox is the author of five novels, including <i>Desperate Characters</i>, <i>The Widow's Children</i>, and <i>Poor George</i>. She is also a Newberry Award-winning children's book author.

It's not that I don't like to wander, but somehow I feel easier in my freewheeling knowing that this place is here, a fixed point.

But I am part-islanded already by a moat and a round cattle pond that juts out into the common, one of twenty-four that are strung around it and connected by an ancient system of moats and drains. The jungled hedges that surround my four meadows comprise a necessary rampart to the winds that cut across the open wheat prairies beyond. They have vaulted the ditches, creating a secret leaf-mould world of ferny tunnels. There's a little wood too, and an old droving road that flanks the land to the west.</p><p>All of this lies on the shores of a great inland sea of rippling grasses that rises like a tide towards haymaking in July, obscuring my neighbour's farm on its far side. It stretches a mile to the west of this place, the biggest grazing common in Suffolk. So, although the sea is twenty-five miles due east at Walberswick, I can still enjoy some of the pleasures of living beside it: the big skies and wide, dramatic sunsets. In Suffolk we have daydream mountains too: the volcanic cumulus clouds of harvest time.</p><p>Why have I stayed so long? Not because I was born here or have Suffolk roots, but because of all the hard work, and the accumulated history. I mean my own, mixed up with the people I love. For three years I taught English at the old grammar school in Diss, putting more roots down among the local students and families who became my friends. There is no more intimate way of getting to know your neighbours than by teaching their children. Then there were the Barsham Fairs and the <i>Waveney Clarion</i>, the community newspaper of the Waveney Valley, which I helped write, plan and distribute, as a whole extended family of us quasi-hippies did, from Diss to Bungay to Beccles to Lowestoft. The rural culture we built together then during the 1970s and early 1980s, based firmly on the values of the <i>Whole Earth Catalogue</i>, Friends of the Earth, Cobbett's <i>Cottage Economy</i> and John Seymour's <i>The Fat of the Land</i>, flushed out all the pioneer immigrants busy settling in Suffolk - rough carpenters, dirt farmers, musicians, poets, ditchdiggers and drivers of timber-framed Morris Minor estate cars - and put us all to work together building what for a golden moment became a grand tradition of Suffolk fairs, ephemeral, dreamlike, gypsyish shanty capitals in fields full of folk. Again, it was work - creative, bold, imaginative but at the same time hard, manual and physical - that drew us together. A shared experience of risk too: you never knew what the weather would do or if anyone would turn up at the gate and pay for it all. Dancing and music played a big part. We had our own local heroes, our own Suffolk Bob Dylans and Willie Nelsons, and any number of ceilidh bands sawing away in village halls on Friday nights.</p><p>The house was a ruin when I found it in 1969. I noticed a chimney rising just above the treetops of a spinney of ash, maple, hazel, elder, blackthorn, ivy and bramble, and what was left of a cottage orchard of walnut, greengage and apple. Like everyone else in the village, Arthur Cousins, the owner, clearly thought the house had crept away to hide itself and discreetly die, like an old cat. He lived across the fields at Cowpasture Farm with his daughters Beryl and Precious, keeping pigs in the old house downstairs, chickens upstairs. The roof was a patchwork of flapping corrugated iron, and the remaining damp, composting thatch was so verdant with grass and moss it could have been turf. I love ruins because they are always doing what everything really wants to do all the time: returning themselves to the earth, melting back into the landscape. And though it is long since I moved in, nature has refused to relinquish all kinds of ancient rights of way through the place.</p><p>For several weeks I paid court to Arthur at Cowpasture Farm, and eventually he consented to sell me the house and twelve acres. We went on to become the best of friends, even sharing Heather, a big-eyed Guernsey house-cow, whom we took turns to milk. Arthur was one of the last generation of the old Suffolk horse men. For most of his life he had been an independent timber-hauler with his own gang of heavy horses and carts, plying the roads between Norwich and Ipswich, hauling timber from the woods to the sawmills, timber yards and shippers. He worked hard, saved up and bought his farm before the war, when land was cheap. He still hung hagstones, Suffolk's flint version of the evil eye, in his stables and cowsheds to ward off the nightmare who might disturb his animals as they slept in their stalls. He was my tutor in husbandry, animal lore and village politics.</p><p>Slowly, I stripped the house to its skeleton of oak, chestnut and ash, repairing it with oak timbers gleaned from a barn one of the local farmers had demolished. I lived in the back of a Volkswagen van for a while, then made a bivouac around the big central fireplace and slept beside a wood fire with two cats for company. The hearth became the most sacred, numinous place in the house. It lies at its centre, and is the only part that still opens to the skies. In spring, I moved upstairs into what felt like a tree house, sleeping under the stars as I repaired the open rafters in a perch with a canvas roof. Soon the wood-pigeons roosting in the ash tree at eye level grew used to me. The tree felt then, as it does now, like a guardian of the house, arching up over the roof in a kind of embrace, and I fought the council building inspector tooth and nail to retain it.</p><p>I found myself then, as I still do deep down, in love with the place as a ruin and therefore partly at odds with myself as its healer. I liked the way the wattle-and-daub walls, baked by the sun to a biscuit, were cratered all over where they faced south, like the peepholes of a Yemeni city, by nesting mason bees or solitary wasps. I appreciated the inquisitive tendrils of ivy that poked their heads in through the cracks in the rotted windows, fogged green with algae, patterned by questing snails. I welcomed the sparrows and starlings fidgeting in the thatch or under the tin, and the bats that later flitted through the tented open rafters as I lay dozing in bed, limbs aching sweetly from a long day's labour. I wanted to repair the walls, but at the same time to foster the passepartout menagerie that refused to recognize them. Somehow, through the sum of minor inefficiencies in a handmade wood-framed house, I succeeded.</p><p>Having personally shaped or repaired every single one, I have ended up on terms of the greatest intimacy with all the beams, posts and pegged joints in the place. I have perhaps also earned some kinship with the people who, twenty years or so before Shakespeare was born, originally built the house and probably dug out the moat. Uncovering the carpenters' coded inscriptions on the rafters and floor beams was like finding a lost manuscript. They were carved when the oak or sweet chestnut was still green and the house under prefabricated construction in a kind of kit form at the carpenters' shop, ready to be carted to the site and raised, whole walls at a time, by the combined muscle of dozens of villagers. The proportions of everything, measured in feet and inches, impressed on me the organic nature of the entire structure. The proportions of each room, and of the house as a whole, were predicated on the natural proportions of the trees available. Suffolk houses like mine tend to be about eighteen feet wide, because that is about the average limit of the straight run of the trunk of a youngish oak suitable in girth for making a major crossbeam of eight inches by seven. The bigger barns tend to twenty-one feet wide, with slightly bigger timbers. Uprights too are of tree height, the idea being to select trees or coppice poles of about the right cross-section, so they can be squared with an adze with the minimum of work.</p><p>This is the beam count in my house. Kitchen: 44. Sitting room: 50. Study: 32. Upstairs landing, bathroom and study: 22. Small bedroom: 23. Big bedroom: 72. Total: 243. If I add all 30 hidden beams in the kitchen, as well as 50-odd rafters, the total is 323 beams. So some 300 trees were felled to build this house: a small wood. The bark is still on many of these timbers after 400 years, and so is the sapwood here and there. The timber was always worked in its green, unseasoned condition, when it is easiest to cut, drill or shape into joints. Once assembled into the hardwood frame, the timbers would gradually season in situ, often twisting or curving as they did so and creatin...</p></p><h2>Suena: Espanol sin barreras | Curso intermedio breve (Fourth Edition)</h2><p>Stand-alone 4th edition textbook for spanish learners.</p><p></p><h2>Scatter, Adapt, and Remember: How Humans Will Survive a Mass Extinction</h2><p><b>In its 4.5 billion&#x2013;year history, life on Earth has been almost erased at least half a dozen times: shattered by asteroid impacts, entombed in ice, smothered by methane, and torn apart by unfathomably powerful megavolcanoes.

The shocking murder of President William McKinley threw into stark relief the emerging new world order of what would come to be known as the American Century. <i>The President and the Assassin</i> is the story of the momentous years leading up to that event, and of the very different paths that brought together two of the most compelling figures of the era: President William McKinley and Leon Czolgosz, the anarchist who murdered him.<br><br>The two men seemed to live in eerily parallel Americas. McKinley was to his contemporaries an enigma, a president whose conflicted feelings about imperialism reflected the country&#x2019;s own. Under its popular Republican commander-in-chief, the United States was undergoing an uneasy transition from a simple agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse spreading its influence overseas by force of arms. Czolgosz was on the losing end of the economic changes taking place&#x2014;a first-generation Polish immigrant and factory worker sickened by a government that seemed focused solely on making the rich richer. With a deft narrative hand, journalist Scott Miller chronicles how these two men, each pursuing what he considered the right and honorable path, collided in violence at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.<br><br>Along the way, readers meet a veritable who&#x2019;s who of turn-of-the-century America: John Hay, McKinley&#x2019;s visionary secretary of state, whose diplomatic efforts paved the way for a half century of Western exploitation of China; Emma Goldman, the radical anarchist whose incendiary rhetoric inspired Czolgosz to dare the unthinkable; and Theodore Roosevelt, the vainglorious vice president whose 1898 charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba is but one of many thrilling military adventures recounted here. <br><br>Rich with relevance to our own era, <i>The President and the Assassin</i> holds a mirror up to a fascinating period of upheaval when the titans of industry grew fat, speculators sought fortune abroad, and desperate souls turned to terrorism in a vain attempt to thwart the juggernaut of change.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The President and the Assassin</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[A] panoramic tour de force . . .

Women in full-length skirts and tight-fitting corsets in the fashion of the iconic Gibson Girl shaded themselves with parasols. The men, seeking relief from the sun with jauntily perched straw boaters, fingered coins deep in their pockets, confident in their jobs. Children in sailor suits skipped and laughed and pulled their parents along as fast as they could. The smoky aroma of grilling bratwurst, the echo of chirping piccolos and booming tubas, the bellow of an elephant, all signaled they had nearly reached the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition of 1901.<br><br>As the crowds drew nearer, a series of pillars, each topped with a horse and rider, could be discerned through the trees. Beyond them stood massive domed buildings in red and yellow, preceded by the stout Triumphal Bridge. The view was capped by the signature structure of the Expo, the 389-foot-high Electric Tower, lit with power generated by Niagara Falls twenty-five miles away. John M. Carr�re, the Expo's lead architect, had carefully orchestrated the scene so that "the spectator, as he approaches the Exposition, will see it develop gradually until he reaches the Bridge, when the entire picture will appear before him and almost burst upon him." Once inside the 350-acre park, visitors marveled at every sort of attraction: a mock Japanese village, a Trip to the Moon exhibit where midgets served green cheese, and, of course, the pachyderm, a nine-ton specimen decorated by Queen Victoria for its service with the British army in Afghanistan.<br><br>This was an especially exciting day. The Buffalo papers were reporting that William McKinley, beloved president of the United States, would meet members of the public at the Temple of Music at 4 p.m. The previous day, a record 116,000 people had crowded through the gates to see him deliver what many considered one of his finest speeches, and the prospect of actually exchanging a handshake or a brief word was an experience not to be missed. Such one-on-one encounters were a favorite of the president. Meeting with people individually, he projected a natural sincerity and warmth. So much time did McKinley spend in receiving lines that he perfected his own handshake, the "McKinley grip," to prevent cramping. When confronted with a long reception line, he made a point of extending his hand first and clasping the other's fingers so he couldn't be squeezed back. Then he would grab hold of his visitor's elbow with his left hand and deftly move him along, clocking up to fifty people a minute. "Everyone in that line has a smile and a cheery word," he once said. "They bring no problems with them; only good will. I feel better after the contact."<br><br>But plans for this particular meet-and-greet had left McKinley's staff feeling uneasy. The event had been well publicized and raised serious security issues. George B. Cortelyou, the president's personal secretary, had twice removed the Temple of Music reception from McKinley's schedule, and the president had twice demanded that it be reinstated. Though McKinley was the most popular president since Abraham Lincoln four decades earlier, pockets of dangerous radicals lurked in many cities. Only weeks before, his Secret Service agent George Foster, who looked the part of a professional sleuth with his derby hat and a cigar clenched between his teeth, had chased off a shadowy stranger from the McKinleys' private home in Canton, Ohio. Responding to pleas to be more cautious, the president conceded only to drawing his living room shades at night. Publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst also tormented McKinley's inner circle with vicious attacks on the president. On April 10, 1901, his New York Journal printed an editorial that read in part: "If bad institutions and bad men can be got rid of only by killing, then the killing must be done."<br><br>Cortelyou's nerves had been put even more on edge when, on the evening of September 4, 1901, the special three-car train the president and his wife were riding in pulled into the Terrace Station overlooking Lake Erie in Buffalo. Cannons set up by the Coast Guard to salute McKinley had been placed too near the tracks and, when fired, produced a thunderous report that shattered eight windows on the train and sent shards of glass flying inside. In a brief panic on the station platform, a dozen or so people, their minds quickly racing to the most likely assailant, shouted "Anarchists!"<br><br>The reaction was understandable. The notorious exploits of anarchists had become, in the minds of many citizens, a very real and horrifying threat to the American way of life. Anarchist newspapers printed directions for making explosives at home and preached the downfall of the U.S. government. Radical believers of the political philosophy that rejected authority in any form had committed a sickening stream of terrorist attacks on European kings and heads of state. In the United States, anarchists had been convicted of bombing the police and nearly succeeded in murdering the manager of the nation's largest steel company. The president, however, had never been one to worry about his own security and brushed aside pleas that he limit his exposure to the public. "No one would wish to hurt me," he chuckled.<br><br>On the evening of August 31, 1901, a slightly built young man entered the barroom of John Nowak's saloon at 1078 Broadway on Buffalo's east side and asked for a room. Clad in a gray suit with a black shoestring tie, he carried a telescope-shaped bag in one hand and a brown hat with a yellow ribbon in the other. He struck Nowak as a "fair sort of man" and possessed a dreamy look. The guest paid the rate of two dollars a week. "What name shall I write on the receipt?" Nowak asked. "John Doe," the man replied. Nowak, accustomed to guests of questionable breeding, thought it somewhat odd but didn't care what he called himself as long as he paid in advance. Nowak asked Frank Walkowiak, a clerk at the hotel who was studying law, to show the man to a room on the second floor. Walkowiak was more curious than his boss. "What made you say John Doe?" he asked as they trudged upstairs.<br><br>"Well, I'll tell you, I'm a Polish Jew and I didn't like to tell him or he wouldn't keep me in the house." Pressing the point, Walkowiak asked the guest his real name. "Nieman, Fred Nieman....I'm going to sell souvenirs."<br><br>Nobody could figure out what the man who called himself Nieman was really doing in Buffalo. He generally rose early and left the hotel for the day. In the evening he would return with a collection of newspapers tucked under his arm-the Express, the Courier, the Times, the Commercial-and head straight to his room. He occasionally bought a cigar or a good whiskey, not the cheap five-cent shots, and stopped once or twice to watch a card game in the barroom, but he hardly ever spoke. The only time anyone paid him any attention was one morning when he noisily searched for a water pitcher, disturbing a retired German army officer trying to sleep in a nearby room.<br><br>Stuffed deep in his coat pocket, however, was one artifact that indicated a keen interest in world affairs-a neatly folded and well- worn newspaper clipping about the assassination of Italian king Umberto I. An Italian American named Gaetano Bresci, an editor of an anarchist newspaper in New Jersey, had murdered the monarch a year earlier. Nieman read it carefully. Sometime during the first week of September he stopped by Walbridge Hardware at 316 Main Street and asked to see a silver-plated Iver Johnson .32-caliber revolver-the same model that Bresci had used against Umberto I. At $4.50, the weapon was priced well above the other handguns that ran closer to $1.50, but he couldn't resist acquiring the premium model. Back in his hotel room, he loaded the weapon with five Smith &amp; Wesson cartridges and practiced wrapping the gun and his right hand in a white handkerchief.<br><br>At fifty-eight, McKinley was still handsome enough for his looks to be a campaign asset. His square jaw and strong cheekbones projected an air of confidence and purpose that suited an increasingly ambitious nation. His large head, some political friends thought, resembled that of Napol�on Bonaparte, and they took to referring to him as such. In figure and form McKinley was very much in keeping with amply portioned men of the day. At a scant five feet, six and a half inches-he made a point of insisting the last half inch be recorded-he sometimes seemed that large around. He might have shed a few pounds, but exercise, other than a brisk stroll in the evenings, had never been a priority. Several years before, McKinley had tried to take up golf but gave it up: too much walking.<br><br>McKinley's most distinguishing feature, however, was his piercing dark eyes, eyes that conveyed a genuine goodness of spirit. "The habitual expression of the face is one of gravity and kindness," the Review of Reviews wrote in 1896. "If the phrase did not sound too sentimental, the fittest words to characterize McKinley's look would be a sweet seriousness." McKinley, the magazine continued, always had a kind word for secretaries or servants and would see off visitors to the door of his Canton home to warn them about the steps. Longtime Republican stalwart and diplomat John Hay would write years later to a friend, "The president was one of the sweetest and quietest natures I have ever known among public men." Journalists, who had the opportunity to see the president on a daily basis from desks set up near his second- floor office, were likewise struck by McKinley's unfailing affability. Frequently stopping for brief chats, one hand in a pants pocket, the other twirling his glasses, he would ask after any who were missing that day and inquire about their health.<br><br>McKinley awoke the morning of September 6, 1901, in an energetic mood. Staying at the stately home of Expo president John G. Milburn, he rose early and made certain he was dressed to the...</p><h2>20th Century Eightball</h2><p>Trailing the success of the movie based on Clowes' graphic novel <i>Ghost World</i> (1997) comes this collection of shorter stories from his alternative comic book <i>Eightball</i>. Many of the pieces are tirades, albeit entertaining ones, about things Clowes despises (perhaps the comic should have been called <i>Hateball</i>). "On Sports" details his contempt for professional athletics, and "Art School Confidential" is an expose of pretentious, talentless poseurs. This approach is carried to its logical peak in "I Hate You Deeply," a litany of the "types" that annoy Clowes, from "fashion plates" to "crybabies, whiners, and sensitive people." Clowes puts his misanthropy in abeyance for slice-of-life stories in which he ruminates during a stroll around his neighborhood or fantasizes about his fellow passengers on a subway. Worthwhile enough, these earlier stories merely presage Clowes' far-more-impressive recent work in which cynicism is presented more subtly, leavened with sympathy, and voiced by well-developed characters. If these pieces lack the heft of Clowes' longer, more ambitious efforts, the best of them are still masterful miniatures. <br><br></p><p>Daniel Clowes is a celebrated graphic novelist, Academy-Award nominated screenwriter, and frequent cover artist for the New Yorker. He lives in Oakland, CA.

The brilliant satire and double entendre intensifies in the Word Market, where after a brief scuffle with Officer Short Shrift, Milo and Tock set off toward the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the twin Princesses, Rhyme and Reason.

Each narrative is vivified by the author's tuned-in dialogue, descriptions of widely separated locales and outre characters. The Moonshine War is waged by the entire population of a Kentucky town against one mule-stubborn bootlegger's son whose shocking ploy wins the last battle. In City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit, an enraged detective serves justice illegally to a brutal killer who evades prosecution once too often. Gold Coast stars a woman, for a change, equal in ruthlessness to Leonard's macho males. Widow of a Mafia capo, Karen DeCilia broods over her imprisonment in a lavish Florida home. She will lose the house and $4 million by the terms of her husband's will, if she even dates, let alone has sex.

The citation for the award read in part: "In his genius, great clarity is joined to great generosity. His work shines with humanity, humor, precision, and passion." Now, combining both early and later poems, including <em>Selected Poems</em> (which won the Pulitzer Prize), Kunitz presents us with the gift of his life's work in poetry. The early poems, long unavailable in any edition, sound themes that have always engaged Kunitz: life's meaning, the relation of time to eternity, kinship with nature, and loss, most poignantly that of his father. Despite the power of his poems about loss, Kunitz ardently celebrates life. Perpetually curious, eager for fresh revelations, he fully lives up to his own advice to younger poets "to persevere, then explore. Be explorers all your life."<br></p><p>Stanley Kunitz's collected poems are an unassailable argument for age, experience, and impassioned observation. At 95, America's 10th poet laureate has many decades' worth of work under his belt, and his lyrics form a fine self-portrait even as they track his evolution toward the spare and simple. Kunitz's later poetry seems to effortlessly fuse feeling and form. With considerable wit, he sees into the life of things: a brook or a bird, a squirrel or a salmon is very much a part of nature, but it is also infinitely more, as anyone lucky enough to have read "King of the River," "The Snakes of September," and "The Wellfleet Whale" knows. <p> Kunitz's "Reflections," which preface his <i>Collected Poems</i>, offer several modest credos. In one, he writes, "I like to think that it is the poet's love of particulars, the things of this world, that leads him to universals." And his work is ample proof that what Kunitz likes to think is right! In "Robin Redbreast," for instance, the poet--living in an empty house that will soon be his no longer and facing nothing but blank pages--rescues a bird from some belligerent jays: </p><blockquote> It was the dingiest bird<br> you ever saw, all the color<br> washed from him, as if<br> he had been standing in the rain,<br> friendless and stiff and cold,<br> since Eden went wrong.<br> </blockquote> Alas, a moment's complacency at his own good deed comes to a quick end. There is no need for the poet to drive home his point--he merely provides the tragic image of an old bullet hole in the robin's head, through which he catches a glimpse of "the cold flash of the blue / unappeasable sky." Yet Kunitz did not arrive at this level without effort, and much of the pleasure of this volume lies in witnessing the growth of the poet's mind. In his first collection, <i>Intellectual Things</i> (1930), the young artist seems to have spent a good deal of time luxuriating in the early Yeats, displaying a sweet tooth for allegory and archaic inversion. Perhaps thinking himself "a fierce young crier / Of poems," the youthful Kunitz pursued the sublime a little too relentlessly. His second book, <i>Passport to the War</i> (1944), is radically different, full of darkness and repudiation, its realities and anger very close to the surface. But it really isn't until <i>The Testing-Tree</i>, where family comes to the fore and influence is no longer cause for anxiety, that the poet finds his voice--one that has yet to desert him. <p> Several of Kunitz's finest, and most desolate, poems explore his father's suicide, which took place before he was born. Others, on Mark Rothko and Alexander Calder, celebrate creation in the face of immense difficulty. And there are poems, too, of resistance: this generous collection includes translations of Mandelstam, Akhmatova, and Blok, as well as his own "Around Pastor Bonhoeffer," which commemorates the pacifist cleric who was part of the plot to kill Hitler. Throughout there are also love songs--to nature <i>and</i> women. "Route Six" makes one wonder why there isn't an official term for a poem celebrating an enduring marriage--an epithalamium with, as they say, legs. After a quarrel, Kunitz suggests to his wife that they head for the Cape, taking with them those passions "that flare past understanding": </p><blockquote> we can stow them in the rear<br> along with ziggurats of luggage<br> and Celia, our transcendental cat,<br> past-mistress of all languages,<br> including Hottentot and silence.<br> </blockquote> In "The Layers," the poet asks point-blank: "How shall the heart be reconciled / to its feast of losses?" Reconciliation, Kunitz knows, isn't possible, but his work proves that the raptures of love and art are a strong consolation. <i>--Kerry Fried</i><strong>Stanley Kunitz,</strong> much-honored poet, was cofounder of the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and of Poets House in New York City.

Richly textured with bits of her own childhood and married life with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, and daughter, Quintana Roo, this new book by Joan Didion examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts regarding having children, illness, and growing old.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Blue Nights</i> opens on July 26, 2010, as Didion thinks back to Quintana&#x2019;s wedding in New York seven years before. <i>Today would be her wedding anniversary.</i> This fact triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;in Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter but also on her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any parent might about how she feels she failed either because cues were not taken or perhaps displaced. &#x201c;How could I have missed what was clearly there to be seen?&#x201d; Finally, perhaps we all remain unknown to each other. Seamlessly woven in are incidents Didion sees as underscoring her own age, something she finds hard to acknowledge, much less accept.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Blue Nights</i>&#x2014;the long, light evening hours that signal the summer solstice, &#x201c;the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but also its warning&#x201d;&#x2014;like <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i> before it, is an iconic book of incisive and electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.</p><p><b>Joan Didion</b> was born in Sacramento, California, and now lives in New York City. She is the author of five novels and eight previous books of nonfiction. Her collected nonfiction, <i>We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live, </i>was published by Everyman's Library in 2006.<i>In certain latitudes there comes a span of time approaching and following the summer solstice, some weeks in all, when the twilights turn long and blue. This period of the blue nights does not occur in subtropical California, where I lived for much of the time I will be talking about here and where the end of daylight is fast and lost in the blaze of the dropping sun, but it does occur in New York, where I now live. You notice it first as April ends and May begins, a change in the season, not exactly a warming&#x2014;in fact not at all a warming&#x2014;yet suddenly summer seems near, a possibility, even a promise. You pass a window, you walk to Central Park, you find yourself swimming in the color blue: the actual light is blue, and over the course of an hour or so this blue deepens, becomes more intense even as it darkens and fades, approximates finally the blue of the glass on a clear day at Chartres, or that of the Cerenkov radiation thrown off by the fuel rods in the pools of nuclear reactors. The French called this time of day &#x201c;l&#x2019;heure bleue.&#x201d; To the English it was &#x201c;the gloaming.&#x201d; The very word &#x201c;gloaming&#x201d; reverberates, echoes&#x2014; the gloaming, the glimmer, the glitter, the glisten, the glamour&#x2014;carrying in its consonants the images of houses shuttering, gardens darkening, grass-lined rivers slipping through the shadows. During the blue nights you think the end of day will never come. As the blue nights draw to a close (and they will, and they do) you experience an actual chill, an apprehension of illness, at the moment you first notice: the blue light is going, the days are already shortening, the summer is gone. This book is called &#x201c;Blue Nights&#x201d; because at the time I began it I found my mind turning increasingly to illness, to the end of promise, the dwindling of the days, the inevitability of the fading, the dying of the brightness.<br><br>Blue nights are the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but they are also its warning.</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Hound of the Baskervilles (Great Illustrated Classics, I224-65)</h2><p>specially adapted version by Malvina G.

For two thousand years, cadavers--some willing, some unwittingly--have been involved in science&#39;s boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. In this fascinating account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries and tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.</p><p>Mary Roach is the author of Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War, Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, and Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. Her writing has appeared in Outside, Wired, National Geographic, and the New York Times Magazine, among others. She lives in Oakland, California.In case you were wondering, some human cadavers do lead active lives after death. For centuries, many have served medicine, magicians, and cannibals in various noble and grossly ignoble ways. Reader Shelly Frasier captures the trenchant wit of Roach's text, which at times is hilariously funny and always appropriately sardonic. Whether we're attending a gruesome autopsy or wandering down a memory lane of corpses, we find ghastly factoids and the people responsible for them around every corner. Not recommended for dinnertime listening, but a must for the curious living, who will find a jocular companion in narrator Frasier.

Now, in <i>The Wrecking Crew</i>, Frank examines the blundering and corrupt Washington those politicians have given us. </p><p>Casting back to the early days of the conservative revolution, Frank describes the rise of a ruling coalition dedicated to dismantling government. But rather than cutting down the big government they claim to hate, conservatives have simply sold it off, deregulating some industries, defunding others, but always turning public policy into a private-sector bidding war. Washington itself has been remade into a golden landscape of super-wealthy suburbs and gleaming lobbyist headquarters&#x2014;the wages of government-by-entrepreneurship practiced so outrageously by figures such as Jack Abramoff.</p><p>It is no coincidence, Frank argues, that the same politicians who guffaw at the idea of effective government have installed a regime in which incompetence is the rule. Nor will the country easily shake off the consequences of deliberate misgovernment through the usual election remedies. Obsessed with achieving a lasting victory, conservatives have taken pains to enshrine the free market as the permanent creed of state.</p><p>Stamped with Thomas Frank&#x2019;s audacity, analytic brilliance, and wit, <i>The Wrecking Crew </i>is his most revelatory work yet&#x2014;and his most important.</p></p><p><p>Thomas Frank is the author of <i>Pity the Billionaire</i>, <i>The Wrecking Crew</i>, <i>What's the Matter with Kansas?</i>, and <i>One Market Under God</i>.

He lives outside Washington, D.C.</p>Chapter One<br>Golconda on the Potomac<br>The richest county in America isn&#x2019;t in Silicon Valley or some sugarland preserve of Houston&#x2019;s oil kings; it is Loudoun County, Virginia, a fast-growing suburb of Washington, D.C., that is known for swollen suburban homes and white rail fences of the kind that denote &#x201c;horse country.&#x201d; The second richest county is Fairfax, Virginia, the next suburb over from Loudoun; the third, sixth, and seventh richest counties are also suburbs of the capital.1 The Washington area has six different Morton&#x2019;s steakhouses to choose from, seven BMW dealerships,2 six Ritz-Carlton installations, 3 three luxury lifestyle magazines, and a Capital Beltway that is essentially an all-hours Mercedes speedway. There are malcontents all over America with a ready explanation for why this is so: Washington is rich because those overpaid federal bureaucrats are battening on the hard work of people like us, gorging themselves on the bounty that the IRS extracts out of the vast heartland. In blog and barbershop alike they rail against big government like it&#x2019;s 1979, moaning about meddling feds and cursing the income tax as a crime against nature.&nbsp;As a way of explaining the stratospheric prosperity of Washington today, however, this old, familiar plaint makes as much sense as attributing the price of stocks to the coming and going of sunspots. After all, it isn&#x2019;t FTC paper pushers who buy the six-thousand-square-foot &#x201c;estate homes&#x201d; of Loudoun County, and even the highest-ranking members of Congress drool to behold the fine cars and the vacation chateaus of the people sent to lobby them by, say, the pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp;The reason our barbershop grumblers don&#x2019;t get it is that their myths don&#x2019;t account for the swarming, thriving fauna that populates the capital today. Conservative Washington is, by and large, unknown territory. The private offices to which it has delegated the nation&#x2019;s public business are not included on the tourist&#x2019;s map. Its monuments are not marked. Its operations are not well understood outside the city. But Washington&#x2019;s newfound opulence gives us our first clue as to what those operations entail.&nbsp;Washington is a strange place under any circumstances. If you happen to come here from the urban Midwest, as I did, the city seems alien and hopelessly unreal. The blue-collar workers who make up a good portion of the population elsewhere in America are a minority in Washington, with lawyers outnumbering machinists, to choose one example, by a factor of twenty-seven to one. There are few rusting factories or empty warehouses in Washington&#x2014;and few busy factories or well-stocked warehouses either. The largest manufacturing outfit in town, at least as of the early 1980s, was the Government Printing Of.ce.4 The neighborhood taverns one finds on nearly every street corner in Chicago are almost completely absent, as are the three-.flats that house much of that midwestern metropolis.&nbsp;While the capital has desperately poor people in abundance, members of the political class have almost no reason to mingle with them. If you stay within the boundaries of the federal colony, you will meet only people like your tidy white-collar self: college graduates wearing ID badges and speaking correct American English. In one residential neighborhood I visited, a full 50 percent of the adult population possess advanced degrees.&nbsp;The city is a perfect realization of the upper-bracket dream of a white-collar universe, where economies run on the information juggling of the &#x201c;creative class&#x201d; and where manufacturing is something done by .filthy brutes in far-off lands. In the hard-hit heartland this fantasy seems so risible as to not require attention. In Washington and its suburbs, however&#x2014;where there are hundreds of corporate offices but little manufacturing&#x2014;it is thought to be such an apt description of reality, such a pearly pearl of wisdom, that the city&#x2019;s big thinkers return to it again and again. The malls and offices and housing developments of northern Virginia so overwhelmed Joel Garreau, the man on the &#x201c;cultural revolution&#x201d; beat at the Washington Post, that in describing them he slipped into the past-tense profundo: the region&#x2019;s &#x201c;privateenterprise, high-information, high-education, post-Industrial Revolution economy,&#x201d; he raved in 1991, &#x201c;made it a model of what American urban areas would be in the twenty-.first century.&#x201d;5&nbsp;Washington has boomed before, and it&#x2019;s even been proclaimed a model for the world before&#x2014;most famously during the thirties and forties, when the federal government looked like the savior of the nation and maybe even of the planet. The city was occupied then by an army of &#x201c;New Dealers&#x201d; who were talented, idealistic about the possibilities of government, and young&#x2014;far younger than the gray old gentlemen who had previously run the place. Today we naturally think of Washington as a young person&#x2019;s town, thanks to all the fresh-faced interns and aides and paralegals who fill its offices. But in the thirties this was a novel development, made possible by the stock market crash and the Depression, which closed other doors and utterly destroyed the traditional American faith in limited government and benevolent business.&nbsp;Disabused of the old myths, and unable to get a job, the class of 1933 went to Washington instead of Wall Street. They lived in group houses, drank hard, and threw themselves into building the new regulatory state. It&#x2019;s not a calling that anyone associates with glamour anymore, but excitement and high patriotism are constant themes in the literature of the New Deal period. One account from 1935, for example, described the city&#x2019;s &#x201c;mood of adventure, the exhilaration of exciting living which the humblest office-holders share with the Brain Trust [the president&#x2019;s close advisers] as co-workers in the great experimental laboratory set up in their city.&#x201d;6The stories of that period always seemed to follow the same pattern: how the bright young man arrived in the city, fresh from law school, where he was put to work immediately on business of the utmost urgency; how he went for days without sleep; how he marveled at the awesome abilities of the people the administration had brought to Washington. I know of none in which the young man came to Washington to get rich. When the New Dealers grew older, of course, they found ample opportunity to pile up the coin, often by guiding business interests through the bureaucracies that they themselves had created.7 But in those early years, when business had failed so spectacularly and when the country looked desperately to Washington for relief, public service became the object of a sort of cult.8&nbsp;Liberalism was something strong and bold in those days, and making government work was at the very heart of it. This was the period when the United States developed a first-rate bureaucracy, and the famous law professor Felix Frankfurter attributed its appearance to the epochal migration of idealistic youth to the capital (a movement for which Frankfurter was partially responsible). &#x201c;The ablest of them&#x2014;in striking contrast to what was true thirty years ago&#x2014;are eager for service in government,&#x201d; he wrote in 1936. &#x201c;They find satisfaction in work which aims at the public good and which presents problems that challenge the best ability and courage of man.&#x201d;9&nbsp;Like all historical myths, the legend of the capable and selfless New Dealer is surely overdrawn. Even so, there were in those years enough genuine cases of honest public service delivered despite peril to the public servant&#x2019;s career to make the thirties and forties truly seem like some kind of bureaucratic golden age. The chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, for example, provoked the berserk, undying hostility of the senior senator from Tennessee by refusing to allow this worthy to pack the TVA with cronies and patronage hacks. The head of the Office of Price Administration, responsible for wartime rationing, fended off not only the spoilsmen of Congress but the profiteers of the private sector, earning the enmity of senators and industrialists alike. And when Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s nominee for chairman of the Federal Reserve was informed that the private sector would agree to his appointment if he would abandon his liberalism, he responded, &#x201c;You can tell your banker friends to go to hell.&#x201d;10&nbsp;True, Washington crawled with millionaires back then, just as it does today. There was a critical difference, however: in those days the millions almost always came from somewhere else. At the turn of the twentieth century, in the golden age of unregulated capitalism, the masters of the great fortunes had found it amusing to settle down among the diplomats and statesmen of the federal city, and so Massachusetts Avenue came to be lined with the grand palazzos of people who had made their pile&#x2014;or, more accurately, whose parents had made their pile&#x2014;in mining or manufacturing or railroads or steel or breakfast cereal. Occasionally these nabobs went in for politics themselves: A 1905 novel by David Graham Phillips is set in &#x201c;one of the very .nest of the houses that have been building since rich men began to buy into the Senate and Cabinet.&#x201d; But by the thirties their days in public service had ended. Now these patricians spent their time throwing dinner parties for ambassadors, publishing newspapers, settling back into comfortable alcoholic delirium, and, of course, raging against the New Dealers who had supplanted them.11&nbsp;&#x201c;Never before have such vast numbers of officials swarmed to the capital, and never before have so few of them been welcomed by the permanent dwellers,&#x201d; wrote one of these embittered Washington aristocrats in the Saturday Evening Post in 1936, the same year that Felix Frankfurter penned his homage to the visionary young bureaucrat. What Frankfurter saw as idealism was exactly what made the &#x201c;hordes of New Dealers&#x201d; so contemptible to the capital&#x2019;s highborn hostesses. The New Dealer &#x201c;exists on a high spiritual plane; he, and he alone, is a good man,&#x201d; the aristocrat sneered. &#x201c;He proves it by the violent sincerity of his intolerance.&#x201d; He gives further offense by showing up at dinner parties late or in business clothes, by his inexperience with servants, and by radiating &#x201c;malice and envy toward the successful,&#x201d; meaning the tycoons this impudent nobody proposed to regulate. Fortunately, the aristocrat concluded, the New Dealers&#x2019; persecution of bankers and captains of industry was inadvertently bringing to town numerous more suitable dinner guests; indeed, &#x201c;the only attractive and able men who come to Washington today, are brought there by subpoenas.&#x201d;12&nbsp;Those swarms of New Dealers changed the appearance of the city, too. The architectural hallmark of their Washington boom was the unassuming two-story, redbrick, colonial-style house, built by the thousands in a great residential arc around the city&#x2019;s core. These homes were for bureaucrats, not billionaires; they were made affordable by loans guaranteed by the New Deal&#x2019;s Federal Housing Administration; and they were constructed according to the FHA&#x2019;s vision of the ideal family dwelling. In Arlington Forest, a suburban neighborhood that opened up in 1939, the houses look like perfect cubes, almost identical, each one set back from the street exactly the same distance, with four windows spaced evenly on the square facade. For your $590 down payment, you got three bedrooms, a kitchen whose sink featured a double drain board, chrome-plated bathroom fixtures, and a basement suitable for remodeling into a rec room. No garage.13&nbsp;I remember the first time I visited the capital as a college student and found myself in one of those brick-cube neighborhoods, with the rusting Buicks parked in the street and the aluminum bay windows bolted on the fronts of the houses in an effort to disguise their sameness. Surveying a row of them, stretching down the block like packing crates on a conveyor belt, was enough to make one an instant punk rocker, and I recall climbing back in the car, turning up the volume on Government Issue or Naked Raygun, and swearing to myself that I would never live this way.&nbsp;Looking at them today, I can only think of the middle-class nation that we have left behind. To own a house made of bricks was something of a declaration in 1939, and what New Deal Washington was declaring was that everyone in the land was entitled to this: a safe place to raise kids, a good public school, an easy commute, and a shopping center nearby.&nbsp;The model survived up into the seventies. A friend of mine who grew up in the suburb of McLean, Virginia, drove me around his old neighborhood, a typical development of that period, with brick split-levels and lots of houses with flimsy pillars out front. He pointed out for me the row house his family owned, the park he played in, the Safeway he walked to, the public schools he attended. No, he wasn&#x2019;t able to tee off from his patio if he wanted, but it was a pleasant way of life nevertheless.&nbsp;His mom stayed home, his dad worked on Capitol Hill, and the whole arrangement was affordable on a congressional aide&#x2019;s annual salary of $20,000. It was designed to be that way; that&#x2019;s what liberalism was all about.&nbsp;The Washington boom that began in the eighties and that exploded under George W. Bush was of an entirely different character. This time the millionaires were homegrown, and the template for Washington housing was ostentatious, aristocratic, and gargantuan. Driving around McLean these days you get the impression that the capital is minting tycoons the way it used to generate environmental regulations and amendments to the tax code. Every few miles you pass another castle going up, sometimes with stone posterns so large they are seemingly meant to serve as a defensive perimeter. Battlements are much in vogue; one house I saw had matching his &#x2019;n&#x2019; hers turrets on either end. For those not so keen on martial architecture, there is the good old Washington colonial, only tripled in size, like three of the Arlington Forest cubes arranged in a flying wedge, with a three-car garage trailing along behind.&nbsp;The one I visited, after reading an advertisement headlined &#x201c;Celebrate Your Destiny,&#x201d; was a Grand Monet, a model in the &#x201c;two to two-point-five&#x201d; range. A more affluent destiny might conceivably lead you to other models, like the Grand Michelangelo, the Grand C�zanne, the Grand Rembrandt, or even the Grand Rembrandt Platinum. But the Grand Monet was good enough for me. It towered over the surrounding neighborhood of brick ranches and split-levels like an elephant in a herd of cows. Not to worry, though; this was a tear-down section of McLean, I was assured, where destruction was inevitable and everyone knew it. What would be left when the inevitable had come to pass was an entire neighborhood of houses like the Grand Monet: a billowing drywall circus tent, with granite countertops and beige carpets and fiberglass bathtubs and walk-in closets large enough by themselves to contain a bedroom from one of the New Deal colonials. There was space for a huge TV in the family room and for an even bigger TV in the basement &#x201c;theater room,&#x201d; where a thick tangle of wires waited to deliver exceptional entertainment experiences to the discerning eyes and ears of the occupants.&nbsp;This sort of grandiosity is typical of recent suburban development everywhere in America, but in northern Virginia the form has been brought to a grotesque consummation&#x2014;a platinum consummation in which the develop...</p><h2>The New Testament with the Joseph Smith Translation</h2><p>The New Testament with the Joseph Smith Translation was originally created for a CES New Testament Institute course at Harvard University. This valuable reference and study aide integrates all textual changes made by the Prophet Joseph Smith from Matthew through Revelation and presents the Four Gospels in chronological harmony and parallel columns. All JST changes are presented in bold italics and clearly integrated in full context. All King James text remains, with replaced text crossed out and available so that the reader can easily compare the changes. The unique format provides many advantages, including:<br>Easy and immediate access to the entire JST in the New Testament<br>Quick and easy-to-see comparison of harmonized King James Version and Joseph Smith Translation<br>Elimination of searching several texts to find the JST text<br>Parallel chronological harmony of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Joseph Smith at a glance<p>Since its first publication in 1992, the response has been exceptionally positive from religion instructors and students at BYU and CES Institutes. Reviewers consistently agree that his book provides a valuable and rewarding way to study the New Testament and is a ''definite must for serious gospel students.'' The text contains no commentary, only scripture and is both event- and verse-indexed for easy reference. The book is soft-bound (to lie flat) with a sewn binding like a hardback book (for durability). This book is a valuable companion text to The Old Testament with the Joseph Smith Translation.</p></p><p>Love the set up. You can read all versions of each story and situation in the New Testament, side by side. Also, the JS Translation is integrated with italics and his deletions left in but crossed through with a single line (so they are still readable). Really has been my best study tool for the New Testament. It has helped me get the most understanding of Christ and his teachings. --Daynia<br><br>This is hands down the best way to read the New Testament.

Mayer Kirshenblatt, who was born in 1916 and left Poland for Canada in 1934, taught himself to paint at age 73. Since then, he has made it his mission to remember the world of his childhood in living color, "lest future generations know more about how Jews died than how they lived." This volume presents his lively paintings woven together with a marvelous narrative created from interviews that took place over forty years between Mayer and his daughter, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. Together, father and daughter draw readers into a lost world&#x2015;we roam the streets and courtyards of the town of Apt, witness details of daily life, and meet those who lived and worked there: the pregnant hunchback, who stood under the wedding canopy just hours before giving birth; the <i>khayder </i>teacher caught in bed with the drummer's wife; the cobbler's son, who was dressed in white pajamas all his life to fool the angel of death; the corpse that was shaved; and the couple who held a "black wedding" in the cemetery during a cholera epidemic. This moving collaboration&#x2015;a unique blend of memoir, oral history, and artistic interpretation&#x2015;is at once a labor of love, a tribute to a distinctive imagination, and a brilliant portrait of life in one Jewish home town. <br><br><i>Copub: The Judah L. Magnes Museum</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is best through personal stories that we can grasp the world of our fathers which the Nazis had destroyed. Mayer Kirshenblatt has a unique gift for evocation of the past in his simple and beautiful paintings. Each one tells a story. Together they make up a world.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jan T. Gross, author of <i>Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mayer Kirshenblatt brings to life the small Polish town of Apt prior to 1934. We see before our eyes the world of Polish Jewry, from the well-dressed kleptomaniac who steals live fish to Kirshenblatt's mother in her kitchen. His paintings are simple, direct, often witty, and always moving. A book to buy, a book to share.&#x201d;&#x2015;Sander L. Gilman, author of <i>Multiculturalism and the Jews</i><br><br>&#x201c;As if memory itself had come and lifted up his brush, Mayer Kirshenblatt evokes every aspect of his childhood in a tender, beautiful series of paintings. The accompanying narrative mirrors the qualities of his art: a remarkable spontaneity and transparency permits the precious illusion that Apt, Poland, lives again in scenes of birth and death, recreations of kitchens and fire stations and farms, inhabited by a full and lively cast of butchers, milkmaids, prostitutes, musicians, all so lovingly and creatively brought to life. It is a magician's trick, a joyous and deeply satisfying immersion in the lost world of prewar Poland Jewry."&#x2015;Ann Kirschner, author of <i>Sala&#x2019;s Gift: My Mother&#x2019;s Holocaust Story</i><b>Mayer Kirshenblatt </b>is an artist living and working in Toronto.

Our quarter was a quiet area of South Amsterdam known as the River Quarter because the streets were named after Dutch and other European rivers whose lower courses flowed through the Netherlands to the sea, like the Rhine, the Maas, the Jeker. In fact, the Amstel flowed practically into our own backyards.<br><br>This section had been built up during the 1920s and early '30s when large, progressive corporations had built great blocks of apartments for their members with the help of government loans. We were all quite proud of this forward-looking treatment of ordinary working people: comfortable housing, indoor plumbing, tree-filled gardens in the rear of each block. Other big blocks were built entirely by private firms.<br><br>Actually, our quarter wasn't altogether quiet. Almost always, lively children filled the air with shouts and laughter; if they weren't playing games, they were whistling upward to call their friends out to play. A friendship included a one-of-a-kind tune whistled loudly to call the friend and identify who was downstairs. Children were always in each other's company, charging off in little packs to the Amstelpark swimming pool, or perhaps speaking in singsong as they walked to and from school in bunches. Dutch children, like their parents, learned faithfulness in friendship very young, and would just as quickly turn implacable if any wrong was done to a friend.<br><br>Gaaspstraat was much like all the other streets, filled with a great five-story block of apartments. There were doorways up and down the street leading to steep stairways. The buildings were constructed of dark brown brick with sloping orange roofs. There were windows both front and back, all wood-trimmed and painted white, each window with a different white lace curtain, and never without flowers or plants.<br><br>Our backyard was filled with elm trees. Across the way was a little grassy playground, and on the other side of the playground was a Roman Catholic church whose ringing bells punctuated the day and sent birds flying against the sky: sparrows; pigeons, which were kept on the roofs; gulls. Always gulls.<br><br>Our quarter was bordered on the east by the Amstel, with boats going back and forth, and on the north by the stately Zuideramstellaan Boulevard, where streetcar number 8 ran, and poplars grew on either side, in straight rows. Zuideramstellaan met Scheldestraat, one of the neighborhood shopping streets filled with shops, cafes, and open flower stalls with cans of bright, fresh flowers.<br><br>But Amsterdam was not my native city. I had been born in Vienna, Austria, in 1909. When I was five years old, the First World War began. We children had no way of knowing that the war had begun, except that one day we heard soldiers marching in the streets. I remember feeling great excitement, and I ran out alone to take a look. I was aware of uniforms, equipment, and many emotional displays between people. To get a better look, I ran between the marching men and horses. A man from the fire brigade grabbed me, hoisted me into his arms, and carried me home, as I craned my neck to see more.<br><br>In Vienna, there were old buildings, not in good condition, built around central courtyards and broken up into many apartments filled with working people. We lived in one of these dark apartments. The man from the fire brigade returned me to my anxious mother and left. My mother told me gravely, "There are soldiers in the streets. It's not safe. Don't go out there."<br><br>I didn't understand, but I did as I was told. Everyone was acting so strangely. As I was so young, I remember very little about those days, except that two uncles who lived with us had to go to war, and much was made of this.<br><br>Both uncles returned safely, and by that time one had married. Neither one came back to live with us, so by the time the war ended I lived with just Mother, Father, and Grandmother.<br><br>I was not the strongest child, and because of the serious food shortages during the war, I had become undernourished and sick. I was a small child to begin with, and seemed to be wasting away, rather than growing normally. My legs were sticks dominated by bony kneecaps. My teeth were soft. When I was ten years old, my parents had another child; another daughter. Now there was even less food for us all. My condition was worsening, and my parents were told that something had to be done or I would die.<br><br>Because of a program that had been set up by foreign working people for hungry Austrian children, a plan was devised that might rescue me from my fate. I was to be sent with other Austrian workers' children to the faraway country called the Netherlands to be fed and revitalized.<br><br>It was winter -- always bitter in Vienna -- December of 1920, and I was bundled up in whatever my parents could find and taken to the cavernous Vienna railway station. There we waited long, tiring hours, during which we were joined by many other sickly children. Doctors looked me over, probing and examining my thin, weak body. Although I was eleven, I looked much younger. My long, fine dark blond hair was held back with a large piece of cotton cloth tied into a big puffed bow. A card was hung around my neck. On it was printed a strange name, the name of people I had never met.<br><br>The train was filled with many children like me, all with cards around their necks. Suddenly, the faces of my parents were no longer in sight anywhere and the train had begun to move. All the children were scared and apprehensive about what was to become of us. Some were crying. Most of us had never even been outside our streets, certainly never outside Vienna. I felt too weak to observe much, but found the chugging motion of the train made me sleepy. I slept and woke. The trip went on and on and on.<br><br>It was pitch-black, the middle of the night, when the train stopped and we were shaken awake and led off the train. The sign beside the still-steaming train said Leiden.<br><br>Speaking to us in a totally foreign language, people took us into a large, high-ceilinged room and sat us on hard-backed wooden chairs. All the children were in long rows, side by side. My feet didn't reach the floor. I felt very, very sleepy.<br><br>Opposite the exhausted, sick children crowded a group of adults. Suddenly, these adults came at us in a swarm and began to fumble with our cards, reading off the names. We were helpless to resist the looming forms and fumbling hands.<br><br>A man, not very big but very strong-looking, read my tag. <i>"Ja,"</i> he said firmly, and took my hand in his, helping me down from the chair. He led me away. I was not afraid and went with him willingly.<br><br>We walked through a town, past buildings that had very different shapes from those of Viennese buildings I had seen. The moon was shining down, creamy, luminous. It was clear weather. The shining moonlight made it possible to see. I was intently looking for where we were going.<br><br>I saw that we were walking away from the town. There were no more houses; there were trees. The man had begun to whistle. I became angry. He must be a farmer, I thought. He must be whistling for his dog to come. I was desperately frightened of big dogs. My heart sank.<br><br>However, we kept on walking and no dog came, and suddenly more houses appeared. We came to a door. It opened and we went upstairs. A woman with an angular face and soft eyes stood there. I looked into the house, past a stairway landing, and saw heads of many children staring down at me. The woman took me by the hand into another room and gave me a glass of frothy milk. Then she guided me up the stairs.<br><br>All the children were gone. The woman took me into a small room. It contained two beds. In one bed was a gift my age. The woman took off all my layers of clothes, removed the bow from my hair, and put me between the covers in the center of the other bed. Warmth enfolded me. My eyelids dropped shut. Immediately, I was asleep.<br><br>I will never forget that journey.<br><br>The next morning the same woman came to the room, dressed me in clean clothes, and took me downstairs. There at the big table sat the strong man, the girl my age from the bedroom, and four boys of all different ages; all the faces that had stared at me the night before now looked curiously at me from around the table. I understood nothing of what they said and they understood nothing of what I said, until the oldest boy, who was studying to be a teacher, began to use the bits of German he had learned in school to translate simple things for me. He became my interpreter.<br><br>Despite the language problem, all the children were kind to me. Kindness, in my depleted condition, was very important to me. It was medicine as much as the bread, the marmalade, the good Dutch milk and butter and cheese, the toasty temperature of the warm rooms. And, ahhh, the little chocolate flakes known as "hailstones" and other chocolate bits called "little mice" they taught me to put on thickly buttered bread -- treats I'd never imagined before.<br><br>After several weeks, some of my strength began to return. All the children were in school, including the eldest, my interpreter. Everyone believed that the quickest way for a child to learn the Dutch language was to go to a Dutch school. So the man took me again by the hand to the local school and had a long talk with the school's director. The director said, "Have her come to our school."<br><br>In Vienna, I had been in the Fifth Class, but here in Leiden I was put back into the Third Class. When the director brought me into the strange class, explaining in Dutch to the children who I was, they all wanted to help me; so many hands reached out to guide me that I didn't know which one to grab first. The children all adopted me. There is a children's story in which a little child in a wooden cradle is washed away by a flood and is floating on the raging waters, in danger of sinking, when a cat leaps onto the cradle and jumps from side to side of it, keeping the cradle afloat until it touches solid ground again and the child is safe. I was the child, and all these Dutch people in my life were the cats.<br><br>By the end of January, I could understand and speak a few words of Dutch.<br><br>By spring I was the best in the class.<br><br>My Stay in Holland was to have been for three months, but I was still weak by that time and the doctors extended it another three months, and then another. Quickly, this family began to absorb me. They started to consider me one of them. The boys would say, "We have two sisters."<br><br>The man I was beginning to think of as my adoptive father was a supervisor of workers in a coal company in Leiden. Despite five children of his own, this man and his wife, although not well off by any means, took the attitude that where seven could eat, so could eight, and so they slowly revitalized their little hungry child from Vienna. At first, they called me by my proper name, Hemline, but as the ice between us melted, they found the name too formal and began calling me by an affectionate Dutch nickname, Miep.<br><br>I took to Dutch life quite naturally. <i>Gezellig,</i> or coziness, is the Dutch theme. I learned to ride a bicycle, to butter my bread sandwiches on two sides. I was taught a love of classical music by these people, and that it was my duty to be politically aware and read the newspaper each evening, later discussing what I'd read.<br><br>I failed miserably in one area of Dutch life. When the winter became cold enough for the water of the canals to freeze, the Nieuwenhuises bundled me up with the other children and took us to the frozen canal. It was a festive atmosphere: stalls selling hot chocolate and hot anise milk; whole families skating together, one behind the next, their arms hooked to a long pole to swing themselves around; the horizon always fiat and luminous, the winter sun reddish.<br><br>They strapped a pair of wooden skates with curling blades to my shoes with leather thongs, and pushed me out onto the frozen surface. Seeing my panic, they pushed a wooden chair out onto the ice and instructed me to push the chair ahead of me. My misery must have shown, because shortly I was helped to the side of the canal. Frozen and miserable, I fought to untie the knotted, wet thongs without my gloves. The knots wouldn't budge as my fingers grew more and more frozen. My rage and misery mounted, and I vowed to myself never again to go anywhere near the ice. I've kept that vow.<br><br>When I was thirteen, the whole family moved to South Amsterdam, to the quarter where all the streets are named for rivers. Even though this quarter was at the very edge of the City of Amsterdam and bordered on the Amstel River, with green pastureland and black-and-white cows grazing, we were living in the city. I loved city life. I particularly delighted in Amsterdam's electric streetcars and canals and bridges and sluices, birds, cats, speeding bicycles, bright flower stalls and herring stands, antiquities, gabled canal houses, concert halls, movie theaters, and political clubs.<br><br>In 1925, when I was sixteen, the Nieuwenhuises took me back to Vienna to see my blood relatives. I was surprised at the beauty of Vienna, and felt strange with these now-unfamiliar people. As the visit drew to a close, my anxiety mounted about my departure. But my natural mother spoke frankly to my adoptive parents. "It's better if Hermine goes back to Amsterdam with you. She has become Dutch. I think that she would not be happy if she stayed now in Vienna." My knots untied and I felt great relief.<br><br>I did not want to hurt my natural family's feelings, and I was still young and needed their consent. But I wanted desperately to return to the Netherlands. My sensibilities were Dutch, the quality of my feelings also Dutch.<br><br>During my late teens, some of my heartiness turned inward. I became staunchly independent and began to read and think about philosophy. I read Spinoza and Henri Bergson. I began to fill notebooks with my most private thoughts, jotting endlessly. I did all this in secret, for myself only, not for discussion. I had a deep longing for an understanding of life.<br><br>Then, as forcefully as it had assaulted me, the passion for notebook-keeping lifted. I felt suddenly embarrassed, self-conscious, fearful that someone would chance upon these very private thoughts. In one purge I tore all my writings in two and threw them away, never again to write in this way. At eighteen, I left school and went to work in an office. Although I continued to be a staunchly private and independent woman, my zest for life turned outward again.<br><br>In 1931, at twenty-two, I returned again to Vienna to see my parents. This time I was a grown woman and traveled alone. Having been employed for some time, I had corresponded regularly with them and had sent money whenever I could. It was a good visit, but this time no mention was made of the possibility of my returning to Austria. I was now Dutch through and through. The hungry little eleven-year-old Viennese girl with the tag tied around her neck and a bow in her hair had faded away entirely. I was now a robust young Dutch woman.<br><br>Because during my visits to Vienna none of us had thought to have any change made in my passport, on paper I was still an Austrian citizen. But when I bade farewell to my mother, father, and sister in Austria, I did so with a clarity about my identity. I knew I would continue to write and send money regularly, that I would periodically visit them and bring my children to see them when that time came, but that Holland would be my home forever.<br><br>Copyright � 1987 by Miep Gies and Alison Leslie Gold</p><h2>Prioress&#39; Tale</h2><p><b>DARK CORRUPTION AND THE PENITENCE OF DEATH...</b><br><br>Under the harsh hand of its newly elected prioress, St. Frideswide's has become a place of deadly sin. The corruption has grown subtly and slowly, but it has found fertile soil in the rage and greed of Domina Alys, who has turned the priory into a boarding house for her relatives, the Godfreys. Dame Frevisse is horrified to discover that the modest stores of the priory - desperately needed if the nuns are to survive the coming winter - are being completely consumed by the rapacious Godfrey clan.<br><br>But the Godfreys bring with them more immediate terrors: Torture. Madness. Kidnapping. Murder. The sanctuary of the cloister has been violated and even the holy rites of the nuns have been ripped apart.<br><br>Despite the growing crisis, Frevisse's best efforts to save the nunnery from itself are met with scorn and torment as bitter hatreds and old rivalries turn nun against nun. Suspicion, paranoia, and despair clutch the cloister's heart. If Frevisse cannot unlock the riddles of penitence for her prioress and for herself, then St. Frideswide's may be no more...<br><br><b>NOMINATED FOR THE 1998 EDGAR AWARD</b><br><br><b>PRAISE FOR THE PRIORESS' TALE</b><br><br>"When this series debuted, its publisher hailed Frazer as the logical successor to Ellis Peters...

It is 2004.<br><br>I wake up on an air mattress in a near-empty room in mid-Wilshire.<br><br>Palm fronds do a frenetic interpretive dance in the late morning half-light streaming through the vertical blinds.<br><br>I gaze around my room.<br><br>The rolltop desk left by the previous occupant is loaded with sides (short pieces from scripts that actors use to prepare for auditions) for roles that I am up for, callbacks, and the near-misses where I just couldn't figure out what the hell went wrong. There are also reams of paperwork from two of my "survival" jobs, neither of which I am working today.<br><br>No, today is the real work.<br><br>It is an audition day.<br><br>Game on.<br><br>Waking up had been hard these days. I was working four jobs and was barely able to get by. I'd moved three times since I'd been out here, been screwed by landlords and Craigslisters alike, and a week ago my roommate foolishly totaled my car while fucking parking it.<br><br>I'd been sucker punched, stolen from, and three days before I left to drive out here, the girl who was the center of my universe broke my heart. One day into my solo cross-country drive, I called her as I was about to cross the Rockies. I told her I would hang a hard right and come to her in Minnesota to give it another try, as distance had been our enemy. The last thing I heard before I lost the signal:<br><br>"I don't love you anymore."<br><br>I came out on the other side of the mountains and saw I had reception again, but no voice mail from the girl. At just that moment I got a call. It was the job I was to have had waiting for me. They had downsized. There was no more job.<br><br>No job, no girl, and half the country still to go.<br><br>California, here I come. Whoop-de-do.<br><br>I had left for LA knowing I had a handful of friends here. Somehow, they'd all gone on vacation at once--not sure when they'd be back.<br><br>And Grandpa died a month ago.<br><br>Yup, gravity had me by the balls and seemed to be doing chin-ups on them. Waking up was hard.<br><br>I stretched all my limbs at once, groaned like I was being exorcised, and rolled onto the floor to the left of the bed.<br><br>Fifty push-ups.<br><br>One-minute bridge.<br><br>Up to seven sun salutations.<br><br>Down to cobra stretch.<br><br>Roll over. Pilates "hundreds."<br><br>Fifty leg raises.<br><br>A hundred crunches.<br><br>Twenty-five twisting crunches to either side.<br><br>Back bridge.<br><br>Lie on floor and curse.<br><br>The day's audition was for a role as a New York lawyer from the streets with smarts but a still-streetwise edge. I got sent out for every New York role out here.<br><br>I took my well-worn, much-repaired suit into the bathroom with me so the steam from the shower could get the old bitch camera ready.<br><br>I warmed up my voice in the shower, which probably sounded like mating camels.<br><br>I shaved.<br><br>I dressed.<br><br>I made a protein shake with egg white and whey for breakfast--the whole time cursing the delicious bacon-and-egg smells emanating from the IHOP next door.<br><br>I went to the garage and hopped into my insurance-provided rental, which I had to say was a pretty cool upgrade on my own car. In LA, you are what you drive, and though I may feel like it most of the time, I don't want the world knowing I'm a beat-up Dodge Neon.<br><br>I checked my Thomas Guide for directions to Culver City, where I was to audition for major TV casting director Eileen Stringer. I had recognized her name when my agents gave me my sides, and I wanted to impress her, if not enough for this project, then enough that she would keep me in mind for future roles.<br><br>I reviewed my sides again. I went over my lines backward and forward-- trying to be as "small" and natural as possible, trying to use my damn master's degree and pursue an objective, as they taught me--to treat today like a performance. For once to have one damn thing go right out here.<br><br>I hung my jacket on a hanger in the backseat, pulled on my shades, and pulled out into the cheesecloth of the smog-covered city, headed southwest. I cruised down Wilshire toward Fairfax, passing cars nicer than mine carrying people more beautiful than me.<br><br>I hated being an actor out here, where everyone is an actor. I missed New York and talking with people about things other than being in "the biz." I needed to cowboy up and buckle down. Quit bitching and get the damn job.<br><br>I got a bit twisted with the final few turns, but eventually found a spot down the street from the casting office. As I pulled into my spot with the parallel-parking virtuosity of a native Noo-Yawkah, I saw a sweet thing in a power suit rolling up with her audition pages. She passed by my car and then got in her own, and I was struck by how much she resembled the lovely film actress Samantha Mathis. I felt even less attractive. I furrowed my brow, threw on my jacket, and headed into the waiting area with the suited, sculpted masses.<br><br>I waited.<br><br>I fumed.<br><br>I waited.<br><br>"Adam Richman?"<br><br>I stood. I clenched my teeth. Quietly, under my breath, I said the little prayer that I say before every audition and performance, and I entered the room.<br><br>I tried to break the ice with a joke.<br><br>"Wow, every actor in LA broke out their lawyer suits for this, huh? The ladies, too? I even saw that Samantha Mathis look-alike coming out of the room!"<br><br>"That was Samantha Mathis."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>Open mouth, insert foot.<br><br>"Why don't you start when you're ready," Eileen said.<br><br>Now, whether it was because I felt so compromised by my inadvertent diss of a certified star or because of the cumulative effect of getting my ass kicked in by LA, I got amped and angry and my game got razor sharp.<br><br>I focused, I listened, and I rocked the audition.<br><br>Rocked it.<br><br>I saw it in Eileen's face.<br><br>"You know, I saw you at your Yale showcase a year ago. You're a very good actor."<br><br>And just like that, it was like all the shit I'd endured here in LA never happened. I'm a good actor and, despite having worked pretty consistently, I now knew that someone besides Mom thinks so. I left the audition feeling powerful and as though my body-fat percentage had dropped.<br><br>My phone vibrated. I flipped it open. It was a cute British girl I'd met while doing extra work. She wanted to grab drinks at a bar in Hollywood later.<br><br>I put on my shades and swore I heard Randy Newman intone "I love LA" over the traffic. I headed to Santa Monica for lunch. Aside from a few parts of Los Feliz and Silverlake, Santa Monica is the only place I've found in LA where people seem to walk, and my fired-up New York sensibilities made me need to walk around for a bit.<br><br>And, LA be damned, I wanted carbs. I wanted to find a taste of home.<br><br>And holy shit I found it, at a slightly sad, older-looking, green-trimmed diner on Wilshire called Callahan's.<br><br>The place looked like a New York diner and was virtually empty. The booths were well worn, and I felt an instant kinship with all those who had eaten here before me, all the actors, writers, and dreamers who had slid across these ancient emerald benches and flipped through these laminated menus since the place opened in '48. After talking to the waitress, who seemed as though she may have been born there, I decided the fresh roasted turkey was the way to go. The waitress beamed with pride over the fact that they roast turkeys daily, and a quick glance at the menu revealed that they put turkey in damn near everything. It read like the post-Christmas turkey list from A Christmas Story: turkey salad, roasted turkey, turkey omelets, turkey sandwiches and salads, turkey soup.<br><br>I went for a diner classic, a turkey salad club, but I added a Cali twist with avocado (to me, having awesome fresh avocados is one of the best aspects of living in LA). I read the LA Weekly as I waited for my food, the words "You're a very good actor" still echoing in my head.<br><br>The waitress brought my food and a coffee. The sandwich was a glorious triple-decker of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and turkey salad that smelled like Thanksgiving Day, with huge chunks of meat that were perfectly juicy and not overly mayonnaised. And there, right beside it, buttery green and chartreuse wedges of ripe California avocado. All on wheat toast with golden brown, perfectly crispy diner steak fries.<br><br>It was exactly what I needed and exactly the food manifestation of being told you're a good actor by a notable casting director. Nutty wheat toast gave way to the watery crunch of iceberg lettuce and sweet tomato, coupled with the juicy, almost gamey smokiness of fresh-roasted turkey salad, the salty crunch of the bacon, and the creamy smoothness of the avocado. Carbs, fat, salt, and nitrates--anti-Los Angeles cuisine for sure, but Lord, was I happy.<br><br>Did you know that avocado comes from the Nabuatl (a language of the indigenous Nahua people of Mexico) word for testicle because of its shape? Well, it does take some balls to name something delicious and edible after trouser plums!<br><br>I paid my check and strolled down Wilshire, past an incredible variety of ethnic specialty shops: English, Indian, Turkish, and Russian. I looked great in my suit, my belly was overjoyed, and I'm a very good actor.<br><br>I headed home and awaited the call from my agents telling me that I would be playing the next New York lawyer from the streets with smarts but a still-streetwise edge.<br><br>I parked, hung up my suit, changed my clothes, and hit the treadmill while watching SportsCenter.<br><br>And I waited.<br><br>And I waited.<br><br>And I--<br><br>Flip phone rang. My agent, Susie.<br><br>I stopped running.<br><br>"So, Adam, I heard from Eileen's office."<br><br>Here it comes . . . Tell De Niro we'll do lunch next week . . .<br><br>"And they said you really rocked the piece."<br><br>"Uh-huh." I was beaming.<br><br>"And they thought you were great, but . . ."<br><br>But?!?!?!?<br><br>"They're probably going to try to go for a big name for that role. But Eileen said that you're . . . "<br><br>"A very good actor. Yeah, yeah, I know." A lump formed in my throat.<br><br>"And that she'll keep you in mind for future stuff."<br><br>"I'm sure," I said, rolling my tear-filled eyes.<br><br>"Adam, listen. It's really good when a casting director like that gives you feedback like that."<br><br>"No, it's good when they cast you, Susie."<br><br>"Adam. I'm serious. Eileen wouldn't say that if she didn't mean it."<br><br>"I'm sure, Susie," I said, with visions of hourly-wage jobs dominating the smog-filled horizon for the next foreseeable bit of future. "I've gotta go. G'night."<br><br>I hung up the phone.<br><br>I choked back tears.<br><br>I punched a hole in the wall.<br><br>I slumped to the ground with bloody knuckles and stayed there on my knees for what seemed like hours. Silent, broken, broke, and defeated--good actor or not.<br><br>Flip phone rang.<br><br>"Richman!"<br><br>It was Geoff, one of the best, closest friends anyone in the world could hope for, one who has stood by me in good times and bad.<br><br>"I thought you were with your family in New England."<br><br>"Just home, my man. Get over here."<br><br>"Man, shit's all fucked up here."<br><br>"Man, it's LA. Shit's fucked up all over. That's why this place is so cool!"<br><br>"Oh," I deadpanned, "that's why."<br><br>"Dude, what's up with you?"<br><br>"Either I broke a mirror on a black cat under a ladder on the Ides of March, or Fate just enjoys knocking the crap out of me. I'm beat, man. I'm just tired of the struggle and always hearing 'no,' of never being good enough, of always struggling to get the next gig."<br><br>"Then quit, homes, because that's what being an actor is, man. It's a struggle, especially out here. But hey, you're a very good act--"<br><br>"Dude, can you please not say that today?"<br><br>Like so many of its residents, LA is a city that is forever in flux, and therefore why we eat what we eat in Los Angeles may have more to do with a particular moment in time than the history that came before it. Los Angeles (literally "The Angels," not "The City of Angels") is the second-largest city in the country, the third-largest economic center in the world, and home to more than 14 million people of exceptionally diverse ethnic backgrounds-- and palates. Talking about Los Angeles's culinary identity is a task akin to hitting a moving target.<br><br>It was founded in 1781 by Spain and then became a Mexican territory when that country achieved independence from Spain. In 1848, after the Mexican- American War, it became part of the United States.<br><br>It is, of course, the hub of the entertainment industry, and people, including yours truly, come to LA by the busload, carload, and planeload to "make it." It is hard to find a "native" Angeleno since so many people here are from elsewhere, and the population is always in flux. Hobbled inextricably to the entertainment industry is an overwhelming preoccupation with appearance and health, and as diet trends come and go, restaurants in LA are forever altering their menus to keep up with the toned, tanned Joneses.<br><br>Another key factor that manifests itself on the plates of Angelenos is geography; because LA is so spread out, one must drive to live there, and drive-thrus offering quick grab-n-go foods like burgers and tacos dot the culinary landscape in the entertainment capital. This mobile food trend has now gone a step further with the proliferation throughout Los Angeles of food trucks that sell everything from grilled cheese to Korean tacos to ice cream sandwiches.<br><br>And let's not discount geology. Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped zone of the regions of the world with the most- active volcanoes and the most-intense earthquakes. This has had major ramifications for Los Angeles's solvency as a city--seeing as how it repeatedly gets hit with earthquakes, and scientists predict more to come-- and for its soil composition, as the activity below the earth releases various com�ds into the workable terrain above.<br><br>The result is nutrient-rich soil. Add to that the fact that LA has a subtropical Mediterranean climate that seldom receives more than 30 days of rainfall per year. This sunny weather creates perfect planting conditions, but sadly also brings with it the danger of drought. Plus, LA is a classic example of a microclimate system, in which the temperature can vary by nearly 20�F from city to coast. This enables the region as a whole to sustain multiple kinds of vegetation and agriculture.<br><br>Because of its subtropical climate and proximity to Central California, where 8% of the total US agricultural output originates, LA has year-round access to the kinds of fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables the rest of us wait for all year long, most notably avocados, asparagus, artichokes, figs, and dates.</p><h2>The Heart of the Soul: Emotional Awareness</h2><p>Demonstrates how concepts introduced in The Seat of the Soul and Soul Stories can be utilized in daily lives using exercises and practical applications that help readers to forge greater emotional awareness and create &#34;authentic power.&#34; 550,000 first printing. $500,000 ad/promo.</p><p>We are all students in the "Earth school," according to authors Gary Zukav and Linda Francis in <i>The Heart of the Soul</i>. And the time has come to create a whole new lesson plan. For thousands of years we were outwardly focused, as we mastered the tasks of cultivating food and building shelter. Unfortunately, we are still outwardly fixated, obsessively accumulating more wealth, material objects, and power. "What enabled our species to survive so long is now bad medicine. In fact, it is poison," according to Zukav and Francis. What we need now is an inward focus, in which we cultivate the heart and live in alignment with our souls.<p> As it turns out, <i>The Heart of the Soul</i> is a timely guidebook, with a release date exactly three months after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. "The pursuit of external power produces physical violence and destruction between nations. You can see this in every newscast," the authors write: </p><blockquote>Billions of people live in poverty, are hungry, and suffer oppression, and brutality. Changing these circumstances requires our hearts. It requires the ability to feel the pain and joy of others, and to take their needs as seriously as we take our own.</blockquote> And here is where the heart lessons come in. "As long as there are parts of yourself that reach outward to make you feel safe, valuable, and loved, you need to identify them and heal them." The authors include numerous exercises and activities to help readers feel and understand their emotions in order to "empower the soul" and live a more rewarding and joyful life. The words and intentions are indeed poignant and worthwhile. The numerous boxes, diagrams, and passages in bold print create a self-help structure that some will find simplistic and others will find inviting. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>Gary Zukav</b> is the author of <i>The Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics,</i> winner of the American Book Award for Science; <i>The Seat of the Soul,</i> the celebrated #1 bestseller in <i>The New York Times, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, Publishers Weekly,</i> and others; and the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Soul Stories.</i> His books have sold millions of copies and are published in sixteen languages.

But what became of the dozens of dogs who survived? As acclaimed writer Jim Gorant discovered, their story is the truly newsworthy aspect of this case. Expanding on Gorant's <i>Sports Illustrated</i> cover story, <i>The Lost Dogs</i> traces the effort to bring Vick to justice and turns the spotlight on these infamous pit bulls, which were saved from euthanasia by an outpouring of public appeals coupled with a court order that Vick pay nearly a million dollars in "restitution" to the dogs. <br><br> As an ASPCA-led team evaluated each one, they found a few hardened fighters, but many more lovable, friendly creatures desperate for compassion. In <i>The Lost Dogs</i>, we meet these amazing animals, a number of which are now living in loving homes, while some even work in therapy programs: Johnny Justice participates in Paws for Tales, which lets kids get comfortable with reading aloud by reading to dogs; Leo spends three hours a week with cancer patients and troubled teens. At the heart of the stories are the rescue workers who transformed the pups from victims of animal cruelty into healing caregivers themselves, unleashing priceless hope. <br><br> <b>Includes an 8-page photo insert.</b><br><br> <ul> <li>Watch a video</li> </ul></p><p>Jim Gorant has worked as a magazine editor and writer for twenty years and is currently a senior editor at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.

There's a collar around her neck. It's three inches thick and attached to a heavy chain, which clips onto a car axle that's buried so one end sticks out of the ground. As the dog paces in the heat, the axle spins, ensuring that the rattling chain won't become entangled.</p><p>The dog paces a lot, wearing a circle in the scrubby weeds and sandy soil around the perimeter of the axle. She paces because there's little else to do. Sometimes a squirrel or a rabbit or a snake crosses nearby and she barks and chases it, or she lunges and leaps after the dragonflies and butterflies that zip and flutter past.</p><p>She flicks her tail at mosquitoes and buries her muzzle in her fur, chewing at the itchy crawly things that land on her. If she's lucky she digs up a rock that she can bat around and chew on, but otherwise there are just the weeds and the bugs and the hot sun inching across the sky. She is not alone. Other dogs are spread around this clearing in the trees. They can see one another, hear one another bark and whine and growl, but they can't get to one another. They can't run, they can't play, they can't anything. They can get close to their immediate neighbors, stand almost face-to-face, but they can never touch, a planned positioning meant to frustrate and enrage them. For some it does; for many it simply makes them sad.</p><p>Out in the field are mothers, fathers, off spring, littermates. The families are easy to spot. There's a group of sand-colored dogs, some with pink noses, some with black snouts. There is a group of red dogs, some small black dogs, a few white ones, a few black-and-whites. A handful of other colors and shapes are mixed in.</p><p>All are pit bulls and many have that classic pit bull look, stocky and low to the ground, front shoulders higher than haunches and a wide muscular chest that dwarfs narrow hips, so that they look as if they're waiting for their backsides to grow into their fronts. Their necks are thick and hold up rectangular heads. Some are bigger, as big as seventy pounds, while another group is more compact, reaching maybe twenty-five pounds. These smaller ones are actually Staffordshire bull terriers, a close relative of the American pit bull terrier.</p><p>The brown dog has a soft face, with searching eyes and an expressive brow that furls into deep ridges and undulating rolls when she's scared or nervous or trying to figure out whether she needs to be either. Her uncropped ears rise from the top of her head until they fold over, but one of them folds differently from the other, so that it hangs lower, making her look as if she's eternally asking a question.</p><p>To help fight the heat, there's water spread about in large tubs, sometimes a little dirty but drinkable. Once a day a man comes to put food in the bowls. At least it's usually once a day. Sometimes two or three days go by before the sound of his all-terrain vehicle breaks the monotony. As he gets off the vehicle and makes his way across the clearing, all the dogs run to the end of their chains, barking and wagging their tails as if they're excited to see him. But when the man actually gets close to them, they tuck their tails and skulk away. Only after he has moved on do they creep back over to their bowls and eat.</p><p>They can't see anything beyond the perimeter of the clearing, but they are not alone. Another clearing lies through the trees where another fifteen or so dogs live on chains, and beyond that, at the edge of the woods, is a small compound with kennels, freestanding pens, and four sheds. The buildings are small and painted pitch black, including the windows. One is two stories tall, and the men who own these sheds, who live and work here, they call that one "the black hole."</p><br><p>A breeze stirs the trees&#x2014;scrub pines and sugar maples, a few pin oaks. The lilt of songbirds mixes with the whine of cicadas and the low, singular whoooo, whoooo of a mourning dove. The summer heat draws moisture off the Atlantic, thirty miles beyond, adding the weight of humidity to the air.</p><p>Within the perimeter of each axle there's a doghouse. Rough-hewn plywood structures, they provide something else for the dogs to chew on and claw at to while away the hours. They also offer a break from the sun but not much relief from the heat&#x2014;just as in winter they stop the wind but don't do much to protect against temperatures that can drop into the thirties.</p><p>Curled up in their little houses the dogs look and listen and sniff the air. They are incredibly intuitive creatures. They learn by watching&#x2014;trainers sometimes let young dogs watch experienced dogs in action so they see how to behave. They can detect odors 100 million times more faint than people can. They can hear sounds at a broader range of frequencies than humans, and they can hear them from four times as far away. People who train dogs for search and rescue contend that dogs can hear a heartbeat from a distance of five feet, which gives them insight into the mood and disposition of the people and animals they come in contact with.</p><p>As pack animals, they are keenly aware of the behavior of those around them. One dog can tell what another is thinking and intending simply by observing the way he acts. When two dogs meet, there is a detailed ritual of movements and gestures. The way they hold their ears, tail, head, their posture. Everything means something. Attitudes, feelings, intentions, dominance, and submission can be established immediately. So can a challenge.</p><p>Dogs understand what's expected of them. When people are around, dogs see what wins them rewards and praise and what leads to scorn. Something deep inside of them, woven into the very fabric of their being, a genetic impulse, compels them to please those around them. But sometimes, the things that men want from them cut against their natural inclinations, setting off an internal chain reaction of anxiety and uncertainty, triggering hormones and nervous system fluctuations. When they are extremely scared, dogs secrete a powerful musk that other dogs can smell from great distances.</p><p>The things they see and hear and smell have an impact on them, too. Studies have shown that if two mammals are placed side by side in boxes and the first one is given electric shocks, just by listening to the suffering the second one produces identical brain waves and nervous system activity; the trauma isn't limited only to the animal that's experiencing the pain.</p><p>Out in the field is the little brown dog with the floppy ear&#x2014;none of the dogs know what's happening around them, but they do know something isn't right. They've seen things they are not supposed to see. They've heard terrifying sounds and they've smelled fear and pain drifting in the air. The brown dog lays her chin on the ground and exhales. Her brow folds into a furry question mark. The afternoon is fading and the heat has begun to fade too, but little else is certain.</p><p>Sometimes men come and take a few of the dogs away. Sometimes those dogs come back tired and panting from running and running. Sometimes the dogs come back scarred and limping. Sometimes they come back looking the same, but acting completely different. Sometimes they don't come back at all, as if they've simply disappeared. As if they've vanished into a black hole.</p></i><br><p><b>2</b></p><p>IT'S NOT EASY TO get to 1915 Moonlight Road. Branching off of the two-lane country highway that curves up through the tidelands, Moonlight Road looks more like a driveway than a street, a narrow unlined stretch of blacktop that twists into an old-growth stand of trees. The houses along the road are sparse&#x2014;worn trailers, single-story cabins and larger suburban manors pop up in clusters of two or three, separated by cornfields, woods, and open expanses.</p><p>Driving west on Moonlight Road, the house appears suddenly, its white shape set off against a tree line that rises beyond it. It sits close to the road, directly across from the Ferguson Grove Baptist Church (Pastor J. D. Charity), a white clapboard building without a cross on it that sits in a clearing. From the front, the white brick appears bright against the black roof. A peaked portico with long columns and large, arched windows give it a distinctive architectural twist. Inside there are five bedrooms, including a master with a fireplace and a hot tub.</p><p>A six-foot-tall white fence surrounds a yard thick with broad-leafed Bermuda grass. Outside the gate at the end of the driveway there's a camera and an intercom. Motion sensor lights hang on the garage. The flower beds are tidy and neat, dotted with trim young shrubs. In the backyard a boat sits on a trailer. There's an above-ground pool and a full-length basketball court complete with white painted lines and glass backboards that can be raised and lowered.</p><p>The house looks like any one of a half dozen others on the street, another newly risen McMansion that signals the country's burgeoning real estate economy and provides a plush home base for some happy, anonymous family. But the property extends well beyond the pool and the unmarked white fence. It twists back into the dense woods where several dozen dogs sit chained to car axles and four sheds stand among the trees, nearly invisible from the road because they are painted pitch black.</p><br><p>Michael Boddie was still a teenager when he began dating a girl who lived across the courtyard at a housing project in Newport News, Virginia. Her name was Brenda, and by the age of fifteen she had borne the couple's first child, Christina. A son, named after his father, followed the next year, and then another son, Marcus, came four years later. By the time the pair married, in 1989, they'd added a fourth. That last child, Courtney, took the name Boddie, but the three older kids, who were ten, nine, and five, stuck with their mother's maiden name, Vick.</p><p>The family lived together in a three-bedroom apartment in a housing project in the downtrodden east end of Newport News. Michael Boddie did three years in the army, then found work as a painter and sandblaster at the shipyards. The couple's extended families helped raise the kids while Brenda finished high school then took a job, first at a Kmart, then as a schoolbus driver.</p><p>Boddie has insisted that he was around throughout his kids' lives, but Michael Vick has described him as something more like an uncle: an older male relative who helped support the family but came and went randomly and for varying periods of time. Vick has also said that his father struggled with drugs, and Boddie's history does show a drunk driving charge and a stint in rehab.</p><p>The kids, by most accounts, stayed out of trouble, at least as much as possible for someone growing up in the Ridley Circle apartments in a town that had been nicknamed Bad Newz. Sports were a diversion. The Vick children spent a lot of time at the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Hampton Roads. Michael, who everyone called Ookie, showed great athletic ability, first in baseball and then in football. He followed in the footsteps of an older cousin, Aaron Brooks, who was a star quarterback in high school, then at the University of Virginia, and in the NFL.</p><p>Four years younger than Brooks, Michael Vick went to the same high school to play for the same coach, Tommy Reamon, a former NFL player himself. After Vick's freshman season, that school, Homer L. Ferguson High, closed and both he and Reamon moved on to Warwick High. At Warwick, Vick showed off the strong arm and blinding speed that would make him a star and earn him a choice of college scholarships. He picked Virginia Tech, in large part because it was relatively close to home.</p><p>After sitting out his first year to develop his game, Vick emerged as the Hokies' leader during his red-shirt freshman season in 1999. The first time he stepped on the field, he scored three touchdowns in little more than a quarter of play and went on to lead the team to an 11 &#x2013; 0 record and the national championship game. His team lost that game to Florida State, 46 &#x2013; 29, but Vick's renown only grew. During the season he set multiple records, finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting, and energized the sport with visions of a new type of player&#x2014;a hyperathletic do-it-all quarterback who could win games with his arm or his legs or both. Suddenly everyone in football had a Michael Vick fixation: They were either watching the real Vick or looking for the next one.</p><p>The following season Vick did nothing to hurt his reputation, although an injury caused him to miss parts or all of three games, and the Hokies lost the one contest he sat out fully. Still, he guided the team to a 10 &#x2013; 1 record and was named MVP of the 2001 Gator Bowl as he led his team to a win over Clemson.</p><p>Vick was now twenty and fully grown. At two hundred pounds and slightly less than six feet tall, he was thick yet compact. His large brown eyes and small wide nose were off set by a strong jaw that made it look as if he had an under-bite. Topped off with a goatee, the total effect of these traits was to give Vick an appearance that, while handsome, could fairly be described as almost canine.</p><p>Although he had two years of eligibility left, Vick decided to skip the remainder of his college career and enter the 2001 NFL draft. He was taken first overall by the Atlanta Falcons, which signed him to a $62 million contract and received an almost instant return on its investment. The next year, Vick's first as the full-time starter, he made it to the Pro Bowl and led the Falcons to the playoff s for the first time in four years. Vick returned to the Pro Bowl and the playoff s in 2004 and the Falcons rewarded him with a ten-year, $130 million contract, making him the highest paid player in the league at the time. Another Pro Bowl season followed in 2005, and he flourished off the field, too, ringing up endorsement deals with Nike, Powerade, Kraft, Rawlings, Air Tran, EA Sports, and Hasbro worth multiple millions.</p><p>Like many young athletes, especially those who've grown up poor, Vick spent his money freely. He bought cars and jewelry and toys. There were numerous houses, including one in Atlanta, Georgia; a condo in South Beach, Florida; a place he bought for his mother in an upscale section of Sussex, Virginia; and another house he was building nearby. He paid for his father's drug rehab in 2004 and gave the old man a few hundred bucks every few weeks to keep him going. He supported a wide range of family and friends, handing out Escalades to his inner circle. He also purchased a fifteen-acre tract of land in Smithfield, Virginia, a small town in rural Surry County. The address was 1915 Moonlight Road.</p></p><h2>Bonnie</h2><p><p><i>The truth has eluded her for years. . . .

It&#x2019;s Venus.&#x201d; She cuddled her daughter closer on her lap. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told you about Venus, Bonnie.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guess I forgot.&#x201d; She leaned back against Eve&#x2019;s shoulder in the big rattan chair. &#x201c;Or maybe it&#x2019;s because everything seems so&nbsp;... different tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Different? We sit out here on the porch almost every night, baby.&#x201d; It was a precious time for both of them. After supper, they came out on the front porch and looked at the night sky. Eve had even bought a book on astronomy so that she could point out the constellations to Bonnie. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s different?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Bonnie&#x2019;s gaze never left the glittering night sky. &#x201c;They just seem&nbsp;... closer. As if I could reach out and touch them. As if they want me to come and touch them.&#x201d;<br>Eve chuckled and gave her a hug. &#x201c;Maybe that&#x2019;s what you should do when you grow up. Would you like to be an astronaut and go from planet to planet?&#x201d;<br>Bonnie giggled. &#x201c;That might be fun. Like <i>Star Trek.</i> But I don&#x2019;t have ears like Mr. Spock.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It could still work.&#x201d; She smiled as she leaned her head back and gazed up at the sky. &#x201c;But those stars are very far away, and you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;ll find there. Would you be afraid, baby?&#x201d;<br>Bonnie was silent, her eyes fixed on the stars.<br>&#x201c;Bonnie?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be afraid, Mama.&#x201d; She turned her head and looked Eve directly in the eye. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t you be afraid either. I&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br>Eve&#x2019;s smile faded. There was something in Bonnie&#x2019;s expression that was making her uneasy. In that instant, she didn&#x2019;t look like her seven-year-old little girl any longer. Bonnie&#x2019;s expression was serene, oddly adult.<br>Nonsense. It had to be imagination. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Eve gave Bonnie a kiss on the tip of her nose. &#x201c;Because I think we&#x2019;ll keep you here on Earth. No skipping from planet to planet. Your grandma and I would miss you too much.&#x201d; She tugged at Bonnie&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re right, your ears don&#x2019;t look at all like Spock&#x2019;s.&#x201d; She hugged her again. &#x201c;And now it&#x2019;s time for your bath. Didn&#x2019;t you tell me that your school picnic is tomorrow? Run in to Grandma and have her start your bath, and you decide what to wear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just one more minute.&#x201d; Bonnie put her head back on Eve&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to leave you yet.&#x201d;<br>Eve didn&#x2019;t want to leave Bonnie either. That instant of uneasiness was still with her. Why not stay here until it faded away. &#x201c;One minute. You&#x2019;re not the only one who has school tomorrow. I have to study for my English Lit test when you go in for your bath.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But tonight is special, tonight is&nbsp;... different,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you feel it?&#x201d;<br>Every day, every minute, was special with Bonnie. From the moment Eve had given birth to her, she had been the center of her world. But maybe there was something strange and beautiful about their closeness tonight. Something that Eve didn&#x2019;t want to give up until she had to do it. The thought brought an odd sense of panic. &#x201c;I feel it.&#x201d; Her arms tightened around Bonnie&#x2019;s small body. &#x201c;Yes, I feel it, baby.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>BONNIE CAME RUNNING into Eve&#x2019;s bedroom in her yellow pajamas with the orange clowns all over them. Her wild red curls were bouncing, and her face was lit with her luminous smile.<br>&#x201c;Mama, Lindsey says her mother is going to let her wear her Goofy T-shirt to the park tomorrow for the school picnic. Can I wear my Bugs Bunny T-shirt?&#x201d;<br>Eve looked up from her English Lit book open on the desk in front of her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not can, it&#x2019;s may, baby. And you may wear Bugs tomorrow.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;We wouldn&#x2019;t want Lindsey to put you in the shade.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t care. She&#x2019;s my friend. You said we always had to want the best for our friends.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, we do. Now run along to bed.&#x201d;<br>Bonnie didn&#x2019;t move. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re studying for your test, but could you read me a story?&#x201d; She added coaxingly, &#x201c;I thought maybe a very, very short one?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your grandmother loves to read you stories, baby.&#x201d;<br>Bonnie came closer, and whispered, &#x201c;I love Grandma. But it&#x2019;s always special when you read it to me. Just a short one...&#x201d;<br>Eve glanced at her Lit book. She&#x2019;d be up until after midnight as it was, studying for that exam. She looked at Bonnie&#x2019;s pleading face. Oh, to hell with it. Bonnie was the reason Eve was working for her degree anyway. She was the reason for every action Eve took in life. Why cheat either one of them? &#x201c;Run and choose a storybook.&#x201d; She pushed her textbook aside and stood up. &#x201c;And it doesn&#x2019;t have to be a short one.&#x201d;<br>Bonnie&#x2019;s expression could have lit up Times Square. &#x201c;No. I promise....&#x201d; She ran out of the room. She was back in seconds with a Dr. Seuss book. &#x201c;This will be quick, and I like the rhymes.&#x201d;<br>Eve sat down in the blue-padded rocking chair that she&#x2019;d used since Bonnie was a newborn. &#x201c;Climb up. I like Dr. Seuss, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know you do.&#x201d; Bonnie scrambled up in her lap and cuddled close. &#x201c;But since it&#x2019;s such a short book, can&#x2014;may I have my song, too?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a reasonable request,&#x201d; Eve said solemnly. The two of them had their little traditions, and every night since she was a toddler, Bonnie had loved to share a song with Eve. Eve would sing the first line, and Bonnie would sing the next. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it to be tonight?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;&#x2018;All the Pretty Little Horses.&#x2019;&#x201d; She turned around on Eve&#x2019;s lap and hugged her with all her might. &#x201c;I love you, Mama.&#x201d;<br>Eve&#x2019;s arms closed around her. Bonnie&#x2019;s riot of curls was soft and fragrant against her cheek, and her small body was endearingly vital and sturdy against Eve. Lord, she was lucky. &#x201c;I love you, too, Bonnie.&#x201d;<br>Bonnie let her go and flopped back around to cuddle in the curve of her arm. &#x201c;You start, Mama.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hushabye, don&#x2019;t you cry,&#x201d; Eve sang softly.<br>Bonnie&#x2019;s thin little voice chimed. &#x201c;Go to sleep, little baby.&#x201d;<br>The moment was so precious, so dear. Eve&#x2019;s arms held Bonnie closer, and she could feel the tightening of her throat as she sang, &#x201c;When you wake, you shall have cake.&#x201d;<br>Bonnie&#x2019;s voice was only a wisp of sound. &#x201c;And all the pretty little horses...&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>SHE SHOULD GET BACK to her studies, Eve thought.<br>Not yet. She couldn&#x2019;t pull herself away yet. Bonnie had been so loving tonight. She had seemed to be reaching out for Eve.<br>She stood looking down at Bonnie curled up asleep in her bed. She looked so small, she thought with aching tenderness. Bonnie was seven, yet she looked younger.<br>But sometimes she seemed to have a wisdom far beyond her years. She had always been a special child from the moment Eve had given birth to her. Bonnie was illegitimate, born when Eve was only sixteen. Her passionate affair with John Gallo had lasted only four weeks but had given her Bonnie.<br>And she had thought that she might give her up for adoption, Eve remembered wonderingly. Gazing down at her daughter it seemed impossible to even contemplate. From the moment she had seen her in the hospital, she had known that they had to be together forever.<br>Forever.<br>Those teasing words they&#x2019;d spoken on the porch had only underscored the fact that Bonnie would be growing up and leaving her someday.<br>Pain.<br>She didn&#x2019;t have to think of that yet. Bonnie was still her baby, and she would have her for years to come. Until then, she would cherish every moment as she had done tonight.<br>She bent down and brushed her lips on Bonnie&#x2019;s silky cheek. &#x201c;Sleep well, baby,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;May all your dreams be beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dreams...&#x201d; Bonnie&#x2019;s lids lifted drowsily. &#x201c;Dreams are so wonderful, Mama. You can reach out and touch...&#x201d; She was asleep again.<br>Eve turned, and the next moment, she was silently closing the door to Bonnie&#x2019;s room behind her.<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s asleep?&#x201d; Eve&#x2019;s mother was standing in the hall. &#x201c;I would have put her to bed, Eve. You told me you had that test tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be okay, Sandra.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d called her mother Sandra since she was a child. Sandra had been sensitive about appearing older, and so she had never been Mother to Eve, always Sandra. It was just a sign of how much she loved Bonnie that she accepted her calling her Grandma. &#x201c;I needed a break anyway.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t get a chance to put her to bed every night.&#x201d; She headed back down the hall toward her room. &#x201c;I wish I did.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You go to school. You work to support her. You can&#x2019;t do everything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She stopped at the doorway and looked back at her mother. &#x201c;But I was just thinking how lucky I am to have her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How lucky <i>we</i> are,&#x201d; Sandra said.<br>Eve nodded. &#x201c;I know how much you love her.&#x201d; And Eve would have had an even rougher time keeping Bonnie if it hadn&#x2019;t been for her mother. She had been with them since Bonnie had been born. &#x201c;She has a school picnic at the park tomorrow. I told her she could wear her Bugs Bunny T-shirt. I won&#x2019;t be able to be there in the morning. But I should be able to be there by noon after I take my test. You&#x2019;ll be there until I get there?&#x201d;<br>Sandra nodded. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;ll be there. I&#x2019;m intending to stay all day. I wouldn&#x2019;t miss it. Stop worrying, Eve.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I just want her to have family there. Other kids have fathers, and I&#x2019;m always afraid she&#x2019;ll feel...&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;re enough for her, aren&#x2019;t we, Sandra?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen a happier child.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;And this isn&#x2019;t like you, Eve. You never question a decision once it&#x2019;s made. You&#x2019;re not like me, who wobbles back and forth every time the wind blows. Even if John Gallo hadn&#x2019;t been killed in the Army, you wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted him to have anything to do with Bonnie. You told me yourself that it was only sex, not love, between you.&#x201d;<br>That was true, and Eve didn&#x2019;t know why she was suddenly worrying about Bonnie&#x2019;s not having a conventional family. It was just that she wanted Bonnie to have everything that other children had, every bit of security, everyone to care about her. No, she wanted more. She wanted her to be surrounded by a golden wall of love all the days of her life.<br>And she was, Eve thought impatiently. No one could love Bonnie more than she did. More than Sandra did. She was being an idiot to start worrying about something that probably didn&#x2019;t bother Bonnie at all. She had never once asked about her father. She seemed perfectly happy with Eve and Sandra.<br>&#x201c;Go study,&#x201d; Sandra said. &#x201c;Stop worrying about tomorrow. Bonnie is going to have a wonderful time.&#x201d; She turned away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to bed. Good night.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good night.&#x201d; Eve sat back down at her desk. Don&#x2019;t think about Bonnie. Think about English Lit. Getting her degree was a way to protect Bonnie and give her all the things that she should have. This is what she should be doing.<br>And ignore this nagging feeling that something was wrong. What could be wrong?<br>Sandra was right. Bonnie was going to have a wonderful time at the park tomorrow.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>NIGHTMARE</i>.<br><i>Nightmare.</i><br><i>Nightmare.</i><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go over it one more time,&#x201d; Detective Slindak said. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t see anyone approach your daughter?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I told you.&#x201d; Eve&#x2019;s voice was shaking. &#x201c;There was a crowd. She went to the refreshment stand to get an ice cream. One minute she was there, the next she wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She stared blindly at the three police cars parked next to the curb, the people standing around in groups, whispering and gazing at her. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been gone for three hours. Why are you asking me questions? <i>Find</i> her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying. Does your daughter often wander away from you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, never.&#x201d; She stared at her mother sitting on the park bench with another police officer. Tears were running down Sandra&#x2019;s cheeks, and she was leaning against him. &#x201c;We were at the swings. My mother gave her money for an ice cream, and she ran to buy it. We could see the refreshment stand, so we thought it would be okay. She said she&#x2019;d be right back. She wouldn&#x2019;t have just wandered away.&#x201d; But if she didn&#x2019;t, then the other explanation was where the nightmares began. &#x201c;I talked to the man at the refreshment stand. He remembered her.&#x201d; Everyone always remembered Bonnie. Her smile, the way she lit up everything around her. &#x201c;He sold her the ice cream, then she ran off into the crowd.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what he told us, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Someone else must have seen her.&#x201d; The panic was rising. &#x201c;Talk to everyone. Find her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying,&#x201d; he said gently. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re questioning everyone. I&#x2019;ve sent men to search the entire park.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t find her here. Do you think I didn&#x2019;t do that?&#x201d; she asked fiercely. &#x201c;I ran all over the park, calling her name. She didn&#x2019;t answer.&#x201d; The tears were beginning to fall. &#x201c;I called and called. She didn&#x2019;t answer. Bonnie would answer me. She would answer&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll try again,&#x201d; the detective said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re exploring every possibility.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lake. I taught her to swim, but what if&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an ornamental lake, just a man-made token. It&#x2019;s only a drop of four feet in the deepest spot. And we&#x2019;ve interviewed a father and son who have been sitting on the bench by the lake all afternoon. They would have seen her if she&#x2019;d fallen into the water.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She has to be somewhere. Find her.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the only thing she could say. That&#x2019;s the only thing that made sense in a world that was suddenly drowning in madness. Bonnie had to be found. All the radiance and love that was Bonnie couldn&#x2019;t be lost. God wouldn&#x2019;t let that happen. They all just had to search harder, and they&#x2019;d find her.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re sending out another search party,&#x201d; Detective Slindak said quietly as he gestured to the officers starting out toward the trees in the distance. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve put out an all-points bulletin. You can&#x2019;t do anything more here. Let me have an officer drive you and your mother home. We&#x2019;ll call you as soon as we hear something.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You want me to go home?&#x201d; she asked in disbelief. &#x201c;Without my little girl? I can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t help more than you have already. It&#x2019;s better that you leave it to us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bonnie is <i>mine.</i> I won&#x2019;t leave here.&#x201d; She whirled away from Slindak. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with the search party. I&#x2019;ll call her name. She&#x2019;ll answer me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t before,&#x201d; Slindak said gently. &#x201c;She may not be there to answer.&#x201d;<br>He hadn&#x2019;t said &#x201c;or she might be unable to answer,&#x201d; but Eve knew it was in his mind. Cold fear was causing the muscles of her stomach to clench at the thought. Her heart was beating so hard that she could barely catch her breath. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll answer me. She&#x2019;ll find a way to let me know where she is. You don&#x2019;t understand. Bonnie is such a special, loving, little girl&nbsp;... She&#x2019;ll find a way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure that you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; the detective said.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sure of anything,&#x201d; she said fiercely. &#x201c;But I am.&#x201d; She started at a run after the search team of officers heading for the trees. &#x201c;This is all a mistake. No one would hurt my Bonnie. We just have to find her.&#x201d;<br>She could feel the detective&#x2019;s gaze on her back as she caught up with the search team. She knew he wanted to make her stop. He wanted her to behave sensibly and let them do their job. But it was her job, too. She had brought Bonnie into the world. In the end, that made it only her job.<br><i>I&#x2019;ll find you, baby. Don&#x2019;t be afraid. I&#x2019;ll fight off anything that could hurt you. Wait for me.

He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<p><b>1. SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>Jesus and the Gospels</h2><p>This intensive guide to the Gospels surveys the largest source of eyewitness information about Jesus&#39; life and ministry--the books of the four apostles who watched Him, spoke with Him, and served Him during his years on earth.</p><p><p><b>Craig L.

Now comes the man behind it. In Mitchell Zuckoff's exhilarating book, the first nonfiction account of Charles Ponzi, we meet the charismatic rogue who launched the most famous and extraordinary scam in the annals of American finance.<b><br></b><br>It was a time when anything seemed possible&#x2013;instant wealth, glittering fame, fabulous luxury&#x2013;and for a run of magical weeks in the spring and summer of 1920, Charles Ponzi made it all come true. Promising to double investors&#x2019; money in three months, the dapper, charming Ponzi raised the &#x201c;rob Peter to pay Paul&#x201d; scam to an art form and raked in millions at his office in downtown Boston. Ponzi&#x2019;s Scheme is the amazing true story of the irresistible scoundrel who launched the most successful scheme of financial alchemy in modern history&#x2013;and uttered the first roar of the Roaring Twenties.<br><br>Ponzi may have been a charlatan, but he was also a wonderfully likable man. His intentions were noble, his manners impeccable, his sales pitch enchanting. Born to a genteel Italian family, he immigrated to the United States with big dreams but no money. Only after he became hopelessly enamored of a stenographer named Rose Gnecco and persuaded her to marry him did Ponzi light on the means to make his dreams come true. His true motive was not greed but love.<br><br>With rich narrative skill, Mitchell Zuckoff conjures up the feverish atmosphere of Boston during the weeks when Ponzi&#x2019;s bubble grew bigger and bigger. At the peak of his success, Ponzi was taking in more than $2 million a week. And then his house of cards came crashing down&#x2013;thanks in large part to the relentless investigative reporting of Richard Grozier&#x2019;s Boston Post<i>.</i> <br><br>In Zuckoff's hands, Ponzi is no mere swindler; instead he is appealing and magnetic, a colorful and poignant figure, someone who struggled his whole life to attain great wealth and who sincerely believed&#x2013;to the very end&#x2013;that he could have made good on his investment promises if only he&#x2019;d had enough time. <i>Ponzi</i> is a classic American tale of immigrant life and the dream of success, and the unexpectedly moving story of a man who&#x2013;for a fleeting, illusory moment&#x2013;attained it all.</p><p>MITCHELL ZUCKOFF is a professor of journalism at Boston University. He is co-author of Judgment Ridge,<i> </i>which was a finalist for an Edgar Award, and author of Choosing Naia, a Boston Globe bestseller and winner of the Christopher Award. As a reporter with The Boston Globe, he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist and winner of numerous national honors, including the 2000 Distinguished Writing Award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He lives outside Boston with his wife and two daughters.Chapter One<br><br>"I'm the man."<br><br>The huge blue car moved slowly through the crooked streets of the old city, its owner sitting on the wide rear seat, his bottom comforted by deep, horsehair-filled cushions that absorbed the bumps from the uneven cobblestones. Heat and sunlight bounced off the brick and granite buildings, baking the Locomobile limousine and broiling its passengers. The morning air bristled with the hint of a developing thunderstorm. When the skies broke loose it would be a welcome relief from the weeks of summer heat that had made downtown Boston ripe with the smells of horses, fish, fruit, fresh-cut leather, and tight-wound rope, all seasoned by salt from the nearby harbor.<br><br>At the wheel of the hand-polished Locomobile was a young Irish immigrant named John Collins, wearing the hat and brass-buttoned uniform of a newly created job: motorcar chauffeur. His boss, an Italian immigrant, had taken delivery of the dazzling vehicle only three weeks earlier, paying a thousand dollars in cash above the $12,600 list price to spirit it away from the New York financier for whom it had been custom-built. For the same price a man could own twenty Model T's, with enough change to buy a modest house. But what was the point of that? In 1920, the Locomobile was the most expensive car in America, dripping with luxury, from its sterling-silver trim to its crystal bud vases. Purring, glistening Locomobiles filled the garages of Carnegies and Vanderbilts, and General John J. "Black Jack" Pershing, commander of American forces in the Great War, had shipped his to France for use as a staff car. The executives at the Locomobile Company of America understood that exclusivity appealed to the elites. They had positioned their automobile in direct opposition to Henry Ford's backfiring rattletrap of the masses. The company's ads, with the look of engraved invitations, stated that Locomobiles were built by hand "in strictly limited quantities because the making of any pre-eminently fine article is impossible on a large scale."<br><br>In the short time he had been driving the car, Collins had learned well the daily twelve-mile route that began at his boss's gracious home in the historic suburb of Lexington, less than a mile from the site of the first skirmish of the Revolutionary War. From there, they rolled east through working-class Arlington and Somerville, into tony Cambridge, across the Charles River, then down Tremont Street to a nondescript building on School Street, less than a block from Boston City Hall. Occasionally there would be detours, most often to a bank, and the boss would use the one-way intercom from the back seat to relay the new directions to Collins. But on this day-July 24, 1920-it was straight from home to office.<br><br>Collins slowed as he turned down School Street and saw what awaited them: a mob of several hundred men and women, crowded together hip to hip, chest to back. Viewed from above, it looked like an abstract mosaic of straw boaters and colorful felt cloche hats, punctuated by the dark crowns of a few bowlers. Some in the throng had brought bewildered children, who cried or whined as they struggled to avoid being trampled underfoot. The street was alive with electricity unrelated to the gathering thunderclouds. It came from the horde itself. Each member was a charged electron jittering in a magnetic field created by the man in the back seat of the Locomobile.<br><br>The street normally would have been all but deserted on a sultry Saturday in late July. But this was no ordinary day. When the crowd saw the limousine turn down the street they pressed toward it, half in reverence and half in mindless desire. They parted to allow Collins to steer toward the curb in front of the Niles Building, at 27 School Street, the modest home of his boss's extravagantly immodest firm, the impressively named Securities Exchange Company.<br><br> From his perch in the back seat, Collins's boss could see that some men in the street were holding copies of that morning's Boston Post. The banner headline trumpeted a victory in one of the America's Cup races by the American yacht Resolute over its British challenger, Shamrock IV. At a time when anything seemed possible except a legal drink of whiskey, elite sports like yachting and golf had captured the public imagination.<br><br>If one subject interested Bostonians more than rich men's sports, it was the prospect of becoming rich themselves. Undeniable evidence could be found in that morning's Post, just below the yacht race story. On the left side of the front page, in bold black letters, was the headline that had filled School Street to bursting:<br><br><b>DOUBLES THE<br><br>MONEY WITHIN<br><br>THREE MONTHS</b><br><br>A Post reporter had visited 27 School Street a day earlier and acquired a basic understanding of how the Securities Exchange Company claimed to create spectacular profits for its investors. The unbylined story even described the Locomobile limousine and the boss's Lexington home, which was "furnished with the best" and "does not give the impression of nouveau riche either, for the fine Italian tastes of the owner fixed that."<br><br>The man who owned the fine home, the flashy car, the Securities Exchange Company, the adoration of the people on School Street, and anything else he cared to buy was named Charles Ponzi.<br><br>Reading the Post story that morning, Ponzi could chuckle with appreciation of his good judgment in granting the reporter access to his office and home. He had handled the interview himself, but from now on he would rely on advice from a publicity man he had just hired, an ex-reporter named William McMasters. At first, Ponzi had been skeptical about publicity-he had not needed much to achieve success that approached his wildest dreams-but his gentle treatment by the Post made it seem as though every card he turned would be an ace.<br><br>The front-page Post story eclipsed two previous stories Boston papers had printed about him and his business. The first, six weeks earlier in the Boston Traveler, had described his company in flattering terms but never mentioned it or him by name. Still, word had spread as to the identity and location of Ponzi's operation, and hundreds of thousands of dollars had poured in during the weeks that followed. The second story, three weeks earlier in the Post, had been a brief item about a million-dollar lawsuit filed against Ponzi by a furniture dealer. That, too, had helped. The fact that he was rich enough to be sued for a million dollars had attracted swarms of new investors.<br><br>The brief account of the enormous lawsuit had piqued the interest of the Post's young acting editor and publisher, who had ordered the follow-up feature story that appeared this day. In it, the Post reporter printed Ponzi's comments at length and without challenge, as though Ponzi had delivered them with his hand on a Bible. During the course of several hours of discourse, the thirty-eight-year-old entrepreneur had offered a condensed, sanitized version of the seventeen years since he had emigrated from Italy. Then Ponzi had explained his business in broad, confident terms, telling how it was built on a modest and unlikely medium: International Reply Coupons, slips of paper that could be redeemed for postage stamps. He'd described his company's growth-from pennies to millions of dollars in seven months-and had boasted of the opening of branch offices from Maine to New Jersey. The reporter had filled a notebook with Ponzi's comments and played the notes back to Post readers as clear and sweet as a song from a Victrola.<br><br>Ponzi had capped the interview with a priceless assertion, and again the reporter had obliged him by printing it: "I get no pleasure out of spending money on myself, but a great deal in doing some good with it. Always I have said to myself, if I can get one million dollars, I can live with all the comfort I want for the rest of my life. If I get more than one million dollars, I will spend all over and above the one million trying to do good in the world. Now I have the million. That I have put aside. If my business closed tomorrow I am sure that I will have that amount on which to make myself and family comfortable for the rest of our days." If anyone doubted how secure Ponzi felt, the story continued: "Ponzi estimates his wealth in excess of $8.5 million."<br><br>With a maestro's touch, Ponzi had struck a perfect balance among the forces competing to control the new American identity: altruism and avarice. Now that he was all set, he insisted, he had no need for more investors. But he would continue accepting their money out of the goodness of his heart, so they could join him and his family in savoring the finer things in life.<br><br>If there was any reason for the people of Boston to be suspicious of Ponzi, they would not find it in the morning Post. The story read with all the confidence of the advertisements the paper ran that promised disappearing dandruff to wise buyers of Petrole hair tonic, or "sunshiny" stomachs courtesy of Goldenglo tablets, or relief from chronic constipation in a tin of Fruit-a-Tives.<br><br>The closest the story came to skepticism was to mention that federal and state authorities had looked into Ponzi's extraordinary investment plan. But the reporter defused that land mine in a single sentence, writing, "The authorities have not been able to discover a single illegal thing about it." Ponzi could not have hoped for a more sterling endorsement.<br><br>Adding to Ponzi's delight, below the front-page story was an ad for a prominent local bank, the Cosmopolitan Trust Company. The bank was trying to drum up new deposits by guaranteeing a generous interest rate: 5 percent a year, compounded monthly. To Ponzi, the ad was a divine gift. For months he had been comparing his promised rate of return-50 percent in forty-five days-to the paltry sum paid by banks.

But if we are not careful, if we do not pause and listen, we could miss the hidden gifts within the darkest days of the year. Author Jan L. Richardson has assembled a shadowy yet warm and soothing collection of paper collage artwork and daily meditations for helping readers see the possibilities of this spiritually profound season. "We require the darkness for birth and growth; the seed in the ground, the seed in the womb, the seed in our souls," explains Richardson. "In the dark lie possibilities for intimacy, for rest, for healing." With these tender promises, like the glowing Advent candles in the black of night, Richardson leads readers through a month of reflections and devotions that honor the darkness and brighten the spirit. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Widely known for such books as In Wisdom&#39;s Path and In the Sanctuary of Women, Jan Richardson is an artist, writer, and ordained minister in the United Methodist Church.

Conversations with God, Book 2 resumes the dialogue where Book 1 left off, moving from personal issues to more global and political concerns. Included are questions about the nature of time and space and human sexuality, as well as geophysical and geopolitical considerations of worldwide implication. The dialogue in Book 2 is, in Neale Donald Walsch&#39;s own words, &#34;...captivating, disturbing, and challenging....In this book, God suggests nothing less than a social, sexual, political, and economic revolution that would help create the paradise on Earth we all seek.&#34; Just as fascinating and compelling as Book 1, Conversations with God, Book 2 will take you to new and more expansive understandings, to greater and more universal truths--as The Dialogue Continues...</p><p>In <i>Conversations with God: Book II</i>, Neale Walsch and God resume their discussion and move on to larger topics than the personal issues addressed in their previous dialogue in <i>Volume 1</i>. For an "unedited transcript" of a conversation, <i>Book II</i> is remarkably well organized and articulate, as if Walsch anticipatd our "but what about" questions before we asked them. The peculiar pair discuss time, space, politics, and even kinky sex, but <i>Conversations with God: Book II</i> isn't here for just shock value. It is an honest look at some of the broad issues important to all of us on the planet, and a suggestion of how things might go if we are all willing to open our minds and have our own conversations with divinity. --<i>Brian Patterson</i>Neale Donald Walsch is the author of more than twenty-five books and the founder of the Conversations with God Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring the world to help itself move from violence to peace, from confusion to clarity, and from anger to love.

Yours is the staggering responsibility and the matchless privilege of rallying believers and mobilizing their spiritual gifts in order to help people who are far from God become fully devoted followers of Christ. Life transformation and the eternal destinies of real people depend on the redemptive message entrusted to the local church. Are you willing to do whatever it takes to lead your church effectively so God&#39;s message of hope can change the world? Then this book is for you. Courageous Leadership is Bill Hybels&#39; magnum opus, a book far too important to be written before its time. Only now, after nearly thirty years leading his own church from a handful of people with a burning vision into a globe-spanning kingdom force---only after almost three decades of victories and setbacks, of praying hard and risking big---is Hybels ready at last to share the lessons he has learned, and continues to learn, about Christian leadership. Too much is at stake for you not to maximize your spiritual gift of leadership, insists Hybels. In this passionate, powerful book, he unpacks the tools, tasks, and challenges of your calling. You&#39;ll discover the power of vision and how to turn it into action. You&#39;ll gain frontline insights for developing a kingdom dream team, discovering your leadership style, developing other leaders, making decisions, walking with God, embracing change, staying your God-given course, and much, much more. Drawing on his own richly varied life experiences, Hybels fleshes out vital principles with riveting firsthand stories. This is far more than another book on leadership strategies and techniques. You&#39;ll find those topics in here, to be sure. But beyond them, you&#39;ll find the very essence of one of today&#39;s foremost Christian leaders---his fervent commitment to evangelism and discipleship and his zeal to inspire fellow church leaders even as he seeks to keep growing as a leader himself. If unchurched people matter to you . . . if you love seeing believers serve passionately with their spiritual gifts . . . if God&#39;s heartbeat for the church is your heartbeat as well . . . then this book is a must. Courageous Leadership will convince you to lead with all your might, all your skill, and all your faith. And it will give you the tools to do just that.</p><p>Bill Hybels is the founding and senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Ill., and chairman of the board for the Willow Creek Association.

On that world-changing morning of September 11, 2001, Manhattan, New York, became a war zone. The terrorists took no prisoners, held no hostages. Death was the only option they offered, so three thousand ordinary people died that day, most without an opportunity for a final embrace or even a last good-bye. The New York City officials who invited me to tour Ground Zero led me past the check points and into &#39;The Pit,&#39; the area immediately surrounding the fallen towers. In the grim shadows of the huge cranes that slowly shifted scraps of twisted metal, rescue workers dug through the rubble, and bucket brigades passed pails of debris from hand to hand. The workers moved silently, listening, I knew, for the sounds---any sounds---of survivors. Those ninety minutes will stay with me for the rest of my life. Words cannot convey, nor television screens capture, the enormity of the devastation I saw for that hour and a half. For the first thirty minutes the only two words I could utter were, &#39;No way!&#39; And I said them over and over again. In my imagination I had envisioned the two slender towers sinking into a pile of debris that would fit easily within the confines of a large football stadium. My mental picture was big---and tragic---enough, but reality was a hundred times more tragic. A square mile of ruin. Numerous city blocks obliterated. One of the smaller buildings that came down was over forty stories high. Several larger buildings, still standing when I was there, were buckling and would have to be demolished. Some looked like the Oklahoma Federal Building with its front blown off. Others, blocks away, had windows shattered. The sheer enormity of what happened that day took my breath away. I said &#39;No way!&#39; again when I saw the dedication of the rescue workers, many of whom were still digging after ten days, with bloodied hands and blistered feet, because their firefighting bud-dies were buried under the piles of twisted steel. How can I describe what it was like to be with them, to look into their eyes and see the profound coupling of utter exhaustion and unyielding determination? There were hundreds and hundreds of them. I found myself torn between wanting to grab hold of them and say, &#39;Please stop. You&#39;ve got to rest. You&#39;ve got to go home,&#39; and at the same time wanting to pat them on the back and say, &#39;Don&#39;t give up! If I were under that pile of destruction I&#39;d want someone like you digging for me.&#39; I&#39;ve never been in war, so I&#39;ve never seen men and women like that. I&#39;ve never seen people who were nearly dead on their feet walk back into the carnage because they couldn&#39;t do otherwise. I&#39;ll never forget it. People like that ennoble the human spirit. They remind us that we can still be heroic. Later in the day, I was driven by cab to a designated place several blocks away from the rescue effort, where family and friends were posting pictures of loved ones on a crudely constructed bulletin board that ran for hundreds of feet along the sidewalk. As I looked at the photographs crammed from top to bottom, side to side, again I said, &#39;No way!&#39; No way should men, women, and children have to live with this kind of loss and grief. Back and forth walked the people left behind. For twenty-four hours everyday they wandered like zombies along the city streets, hoping against hope that someone could tell them something about their father, their daughter, their friend. There was no way they could move on with their lives. They couldn&#39;t eat or sleep. They couldn&#39;t go home without some information, some piece of news, some degree of closure. I could understand their tenacity. What else could they do? If my family---Lynne or Shauna or Todd---or my friends were among those missing beneath the rubble, I would do the same. I&#39;d plaster their pictures all over that wall; I&#39;d grab people by the collar if I thought they could offer me one little shred of information or hope. As I hailed a cab to take me back to my hotel, I felt like screaming my next &#39;No way!&#39; in an attempt to block out the bitterest truth of all, that all this suffering, this holocaust, was caused not by a natural calamity or even some freak accident, but by the deliberate schemes of fellow human beings. No earthquake, no shift in geological plates caused this wreckage. No flood, tornado, or hurricane did this. The death and destruction surrounding me were the direct result of the careful plans of people so caught up in radical political beliefs and so filled with hatred that as they watched the television coverage of Ground Zero they high-fived each other and jumped for joy. &#39;No way!&#39; I cried again. There&#39;s no way evil can run this deep. But it did. No matter how incomprehensible was the scene surrounding me, the enormity of evil behind it could not be denied. But strangely, while the ashes smoldered around me and grief overwhelmed me, even then, a profound hope rose in my heart. Slicing through the anguished &#39;no ways&#39; reverberating in my mind were the words I had repeated ten thousand times before, but now they cut with the flash of urgency. The local church is the hope of the world. The local church is the hope of the world. I could see it so clearly. I do not intend to minimize the contribution of the many fine organizations performing wonderful, loving, charitable acts in the middle of the misery of Ground Zero. The Red Cross was handing out work gloves and breathing masks, fresh socks and clean boots. Restaurants were setting up barbecue grills on sidewalks and cooking free food for rescue workers. Soft drink manufacturers donated beverages. Humanitarian groups and corporations set up trust funds with hundreds of millions of dollars for the families of victims. Money poured in. For all these actions Americans should be proud. And I certainly am.</p><h2>Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)</h2><p>"TRENCHANT AND DROLL."<br>--St. Petersburg Times<br>After six months in London, Agatha Raisin returns to her beloved Cotswold village--and to her attractive neighbor, James Lacey.

After an April in Paris she'd rather forget, Nanette is back in New York, looking for gigs and staking out her favorite corners (without telling her mother, who thinks Nanette is teaching French at NYU). She's hit rock bottom and is crankily content to stay there, when a gift "mojo doll" from Harlem folk artist Ida Williams starts turning her luck around. But when Ida is suddenly shot to death in the middle of Nanette's new uptown gig, the guilt-stricken saxophonist wants to know why. Her investigation takes her from Ida's suspiciously checkered past to the recent murder of Black Hat, a rising young rap star; as Nanette struggles to make sense of these discordant notes, she and her closest friends find themselves whistling in an increasingly threatening dark.<p> Charlotte Carter, who introduced Nanette in <i>Rhode Island Red</i> and followed it up with <i>Coq au Vin</i>, has a hot property in her heroine, whose independence and wry self-deprecation echo Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone (<i>N Is for Noose</i>, <i>O Is for Outlaw</i>). Nanette's gleeful sense of the absurd will also have readers thinking of Janet Evanovich's New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum (<i>High Five</i>, <i>Hot Six</i>).</p><p> Unfortunately, Carter can't quite match Grafton's ability to weave tricky and disturbing plots, nor Evanovich's razor-sharp, dead-on prose. <i>Drumsticks</i> will satisfy readers eager for more of Nanette's quick tongue and keen wit, but its incoherent plot and half-hearted attention to secondary character development too often detract from its heroine's obvious appeal. Turn off the logic switch in your brain, then, and read for the sheer pleasure of Nanette's voice. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Charlotte Carter has a lifelong love of crime fiction.

This book is illustrated with over 30 charts, maps, and diagrams.</p><p>American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, &#34;&#34;Prophetic Truth,&#34;&#34; for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God&#39;s Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.&#34;</p><h2>The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity</h2><p>Maccoby&#39;s account of Paul is nothing short of a thorough shredding. If Paul was a trained Pharisee, why don&#39;t his arguments have the sound logical structure he should have learned in Pharisee School? Isn&#39;t there something a little funny about the way Paul whipped out Roman citizenship papers whenever he got into trouble? And just what _was_ the nature of the famous disagreement between Peter and Paul? Maccoby&#39;s Paul was, in short, a cunning rogue who pieced together a new religion from bits of this and that, and then dressed the whole thing up with a sprinkling of out-of-context Torah quotations. Does he denigrate Paul too far? Perhaps. Does he fail to account adequately for the rise of Christianity? Perhaps. But can we ever read the letters of Paul the same way again after Maccoby has scrutinized them? Undoubtedly not. Agree or disagree, Maccoby&#39;s volume makes a strong counterargument to those who, having reclaimed Jesus as a Jew, wish to extend the same courtesy to Paul.

This present condition of global trauma is not "natural," but a result of humanity's destructive actions. And, according to Masanobu Fukuoka, it is reversible. We need to change not only our methods of earth stewardship, but also the very way we think about the relationship between human beings and nature.</p> <p>Fukuoka grew up on a farm on the island of Shikoku in Japan. As a young man he worked as a customs inspector for plants going into and out of the country. This was in the 1930s when science seemed poised to create a new world of abundance and leisure, when people fully believed they could improve upon nature by applying scientific methods and thereby reap untold rewards. While working there, Fukuoka had an insight that changed his life forever. He returned to his home village and applied this insight to developing a revolutionary new way of farming that he believed would be of great benefit to society. This method, which he called "natural farming," involved working with, not in opposition to, nature.</p> <p>Fukuoka's inspiring and internationally best-selling book, <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> was first published in English in 1978. In this book, Fukuoka described his philosophy of natural farming and why he came to farm the way he did. <em>One-Straw</em> was a huge success in the West, and spoke directly to the growing movement of organic farmers and activists seeking a new way of life. For years after its publication, Fukuoka traveled around the world spreading his teachings and developing a devoted following of farmers seeking to get closer to the truth of nature.</p> <p><em>Sowing Seeds in the Desert</em>, a summation of those years of travel and research, is Fukuoka's last major work-and perhaps his most important. Fukuoka spent years working with people and organizations in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, to prove that you could, indeed, grow food and regenerate forests with very little irrigation in the most desolate of places. Only by greening the desert, he said, would the world ever achieve true food security.</p> <p>This revolutionary book presents Fukuoka's plan to rehabilitate the deserts of the world using natural farming, including practical solutions for feeding a growing human population, rehabilitating damaged landscapes, reversing the spread of desertification, and providing a deep understanding of the relationship between human beings and nature. Fukuoka's message comes right at the time when people around the world seem to have lost their frame of reference, and offers us a way forward. <br><br></p></p><p><p>Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008) was a farmer and philosopher who was born and raised on the Japanese island of Shikoku. He studied plant pathology and spent several years working as a customs inspector in Yokohama. While working there, at the age of 25, he had an inspiration that changed his life. He decided to quit his job, return to his home village, and put his ideas into practice by applying them to agriculture.</p> <p>Over the next sixty-five years he worked to develop a system of natural farming that demonstrated the insight he was given as a young man, believing that it could be of great benefit to the world. He did not plow his fields, used no agricultural chemicals or prepared fertilizers, and did not flood his rice fields as farmers have done in Asia for centuries, and yet his yields equaled or surpassed the most productive farms in Japan.</p> <p>In 1975 he wrote <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em>, a best-selling book that described his life&#x2019;s journey, his philosophy, and farming techniques. This book has been translated into more than twenty-five languages and has helped make Mr. Fukuoka a leader in the worldwide sustainable agriculture movement. He continued farming until shortly before his death in 2008, at the age of ninety-five.</p> <p>After <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> was published in English, Mr. Fukuoka traveled to Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States. His interest turned to rehabilitating the deserts of the world using his natural farming techniques. Mr. Fukuoka is also the author of <em>The Natural Way of Farming</em> and <em>The Road Back to Nature</em>. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award, often referred to as the &#x201c;Nobel of Asia,&#x201d; for Public Service.</p><p><strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em>-</strong><br>From the late author of bestseller <em>The One Straw Revolution</em> (1978) comes a similar book about a philosophical approach to natural farming."The fundamental concept of a natural farm," writes Fukuoka (<em>The Natural Way of Farming</em>, 1985, etc.), "begins with intuitively grasping nature's original form, where many varieties of plants and animals live together as a harmonious whole, joyfully and in mutual benefit." In this English translation of the author's last work (first published in Japan in 1996), he decries the "indiscriminate deforestation and large-scale agriculture carried out in order to support the materialistic cultures of the developed countries." This process has created a condition called "desertification," the inability of the soil to grow anything. Because humans have lost their connection with nature, Fukuoka advocates foregoing harmful modern methods of farming in favor of a simpler approach. Based primarily on the success of his farm in Japan, the author believes the solution lies in aerial distribution of a large variety of plants via clay seed pellets, the use of cover crops, and a no-tilling approach to the soil. By seeding a wide variety of species in the desert, nature will select those plants best suited for a particular location. These plants will flourish, drawing water from deep within the earth and thereby allowing other plants and trees to prosper. Taking his philosophy to Africa, India and the United States, among other places, Fukuoka demonstrated that, given sufficient time, seeding fallow earth with vegetables, plants and trees created a lush setting. More a spiritual analysis of farming methods than a hands-on approach, the book still provides viable and simple solutions to the world's increased need for productive land. An enlightened method for reclaiming the barren soils of the world.<br><br></p><br><br><p>"Masanobu Fukuoka ran a course on natural farming, and gave our Howard lecture at Navdanya's biodiversity farm in the Doon valley of India, and we even have a cottage named the Fukuoka hut. He was a teacher ahead of his time. 'Sowing seeds in the desert' is what all of humanity has to learn to do, whether it is in economic desert created by Wall Street, or an ecological desert created by globalized corporate agriculture."<strong>--Vandana Shiva, founder of Navdanya Research Foundation for Science Technology &amp; Ecology</strong><br><br></p><br><br><p>"Distilling what he has gathered from a lifetime of learning from nature, Masanobu Fukuoka offers us his gentle philosophy and a wealth of practical ideas for using natural farming to restore a damaged planet. <em>Sowing Seeds in the Desert</em> will persuade any reader that the imperiled living world is our greatest teacher, and inspire them to care for it as vigorously as Fukuoka has."<strong>--Toby Hemenway, author of <em>Gaia's Garden</em></strong><br><br></p><br><br><p>"This book is a bombshell. Forget the gentle and retiring farmer of <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> fame, replaced now by a flaming, world-travelling revolutionary. To achieve the kind of natural farming that can avoid worldwide collapse, Masanobu Fukuoka bluntly and fearlessly insists that we must first reject traditional ideas about God, the after life, accepted economic systems--especially capitalism--much of current agricultural thinking including organic farming, and even parts of science which he says are based on mistaken notions about the connection between cause and effect. Once we return to a way of life dictated by nature, not institutional religions, he says, we can apply his unorthodox farming methods to make the deserts bloom and the green fields stay lush without much expense or even labor involved.Be prepared to be mystified, irritated, shocked, and maybe even, if you persevere to the end, enlightened and encouraged by this trail-blazing book. Disagree with Fukuoka's provocative pronouncements at your own risk. Some of what he predicted in this book, originally written in Japanese in the 1990s has already happened, especially the collapse of the Japanese economy in recent years and the spread of deserts throughout the world."<strong>--Gene Logsdon, author of <em>A Sanctuary of Trees</em></strong><br><br></p><br><br><p>"From our first meeting with Masanobu Fukuoka Sensei in the late 1970's at Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, he has served as a primary guide, teacher, and inspiration in the engaged practice of organic farming and Zen meditation. Now with <em>Sowing Seeds in the Desert</em>, Fukuoka Sensei's teaching of Natural Farming continues to grow, sending deep roots down into the terrain of global restoration and food security for a hungry world. This wonderful book is to be celebrated and savored for its grounded, encouraging wisdom."<strong>--Wendy Johnson, author of <em>Gardening at the Dragon's Gate</em></strong><br><br></p><br><br><p>"Fans of Fukuoka's <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> will be delighted by <em>Sowing Seeds in the Desert</em>, his last book. It is a rich treasure trove detailing how his own philosophy of farming evolved and how he decided to apply what he learned on his own farm in Japan to other parts of the world. His insights into the tragedies of taking Western, industrial agriculture to places like Africa to 'enrich the national economy,' and his alternative approach of working with indigenous farmers to enable them to become self-sufficient, is instructive for all of us."<strong>--Frederick Kirschenmann, Author of <em>Cultivating an Ecological Conscience: Essays From a Farmer Philosopher</em></strong><br><br></p><br><br><p>"This book is not a breath of fresh air, it's a howling gale from the East. It challenges us to think outside our normal, rational frames and venture into a whole new way of relating to spirituality, the earth, and the growing of food. As I read, I was tempted to pick holes in Fukuoka's prescriptions for greening the world's deserts, but I kept coming back to the inescapable fact that he farmed his own land according to these principles over many years and produced a <em>lot</em> of food."<strong>--Patrick Whitefield, author of <em>The Earth Care Manual</em></strong><br><br></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Booklist-</strong></em><br>The vision of the late Japanese farmer and philosopher Fukuoka, a pioneer in natural farming techniques and author of the now classic <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em> (1978), extends far beyond agriculture. In his final book, a far-reaching treatise on &#x2018;earth stewardship,&#x2019; he considers dragonflies, Darwin, and even a meeting with Einstein&#x2019;s niece as he reflects on the best possible future for human society. At times Fukuoka&#x2019;s prose can be striking in its simplicity as when he writes, &#x2018;In nature there are no beneficial or harmful insects,&#x2019; and furthermore, &#x2018;this is a human construct akin to saying the right hand is good and the left hand is bad.&#x2019; Fukuoka never wastes a word or thought, insisting the reader consider all aspects of how we grow our food everywhere in the world and how the food industry manipulates supply and demand for gross profit in ways both economically and socially damaging. Fukuoka&#x2019;s techniques have been and still are world-changing; the challenge now is to continue practicing them without the master here to lead the way.</p><br><br><p><em><strong> ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br>Small-scale and urban farming as well as sustainable living and organic food purchasing are so prevalent right now that these practices are moving from a foodie trend to a fundamental shift in our food system. One of the people to thank for that momentum is Masanobu Fukuoka, whose The One-Straw Revolution became a must-read for organic farmers and their supporters around the world. Before his death in 2008, Fukuoka spent decades working on natural farming techniques that he felt could benefit the world. He didn&#x2019;t plow his field, use fertilizer, or flood his rice fields, in keeping with the methods traditional to many indigenous cultures. Commonly referred to as &#x2018;Do-Nothing Farming,&#x2019; his techniques are part of a wider philosophy about respecting nature&#x2019;s own principles and rhythms. The success of his work sent Fukuoka from his small village in Japan to speaking engagements across the world, where he spent a great deal of time addressing issues of limited resources in areas like Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. In this, his last major book, Fukuoka draws from those experiences to create, once again, a timeless work that has the ability to create a revolution in agriculture. Beyond Fukuoka&#x2019;s important philosophy, his book is a lyrical, lovely valentine to nature. He&#x2019;s passionate about bringing other people to the near-enlightenment state in which he lived, where every single leaf moved him to appreciation.&nbsp; Expertly argued and backed by experience, anecdotes, and simple logic, Fukuoka&#x2019;s last work shines just as brightly as his first.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em><br>Renowned Japanese agriculturist and philosopher Fukuoka&#x2019;s (<em>The One-Straw Revolution</em>) final work calls on modern-day farmers to reconsider their methods and heed the needs of the land. Navigating work with international organizations&#x2014;particularly in Africa, South Asia, and the United States&#x2014;he illuminates regional disparities in environmental and agricultural thought and practice. Through trial-and-error and years of acute observation, Fukuoka developed a pioneering vision to &#x2018;avoid unnecessary work, especially work that was created as an adverse side effect of previous actions.&#x2019; He describes these misguided experiments and failures, such as leaving an orchard completely on its own, as &#x2018;not natural farming; it was abandonment.&#x2019; In clarifying popular misconceptions about organic and natural farming, he advises that we must not focus on cash crops, because &#x2018;there is no good or bad among life-forms on earth.&#x2019; Only by the co-existence of myriad micro-organisms and vegetation will we be able to preserve and maintain our land. More important, the best farming was simple, &#x2018;rather than the modern approach of applying increasingly complex techniques to remake nature entirely for the benefit of human beings.&#x2019; Though elimination of mechanization might be tough for modern agriculturalists to swallow, Fukuoka&#x2019;s last message provides a spiritually and environmentally enriching alternative to the farming conditions we know today.</p></p><h2>PRO-LIFE KIDS!</h2><p>***WILL BE IN STOCK DEC. 19th!***Children are naturally pro-life.

That something is wrong-headed ideology, some philosophical error grown into a massive system of thought, an agenda that if unleashed would mutilate and crush civilization as we know it.Murray Rothbard had a nose for such error. And when he smelled it, he wrote it up, exposed its underside, refuted its logic, and obliterated its intellectual foundation. That's why he was so hated&#x2014;and so loved. He is so relentless that it makes the reader squirm. But he also teaches and inspires.So it goes through this wonderful book called "Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature, and Other Essays." It might just be the wildest Rothbard romp ever. Fully armed, he slices and dices crazies of all sorts, from those who would level all incomes to those who would free all people's of the world through bombings and nuclear war. This is Rothbard providing the reader a strong does of sanity against the hordes of ideological fanatics who care not a knit for reality or reason.But Rothbard is not one of those thinkers who, like Russell Kirk, conclude that ideology is itself a bad thing. On the contrary, Rothbard believes that ideology is critical for the defense of liberty: we must organize our ideas to make sense of the world and to have an agenda for the future.Thus does this book also include outstanding pieces of positive theory, including "Justice and Property Rights," "War, Peace, and the State," and "Left and Right: The Prospects for Liberty." It concludes with his rallying cry: "Why Be Libertarian?"With all the political books out there, each with a partisan spin, it's wonderful to read a thinker who doesn't fear exposing the errors of left and right, measuring anyone and everyone against the great benchmark of the idea of liberty.</p><p>Murray N. Rothbard (1926-1995) distinguished himself as an economist, writing a major treatise on theory, several important economic histories, and a highly praised history of economic thought. But he was also known as the pioneer thinker of libertarianism, the political philosophy that roots freedom in private property ownership and decries the state as inherently contrary to the ethics of a free society. Writing from this perspective, he gained a reputation as the most provocative and influential contributor to the anarchist tradition in our century.</p><h2>Graveyards of the Pacific: From Pearl Harbor to Bikini Island</h2><p>The famed oceanographer and marine explorer offers a richly illustrated underwater tour of World War II Pacific battle sites at Midway, Guadalcanal, Truk Lagoon, Pearl Harbor, and Bikini Island, in a volume that is complemented by firsthand account of Ballard&#39;s expeditions, rare archival photographs, and the stories of eyewitnesses to the Pacific conflicts.</p><p><i>Graveyards of the Pacific</i> offers exactly what readers expect from <i>National Geographic</i>: A beautiful book full of outstanding photos and graphics. It is worth reading (bestselling historian Stephen E. Ambrose writes the introduction), but even better to look at. Coauthor Robert D. Ballard, of course, is the explorer best known for discovering the <i>Titanic</i> on the Atlantic seabed. As the title suggests, <i>Graveyards of the Pacific</i> focuses on the Second World War. It includes fewer underwater photos than what one might expect from a book coauthored by Ballard--no more than a dozen or so. But each is well selected: A Japanese torpedo lying on the floor of Pearl Harbor, planes encrusted by decades of marine growth, the mast of an aircraft transport surrounded by fish and covered with seaweed--in the shape of a cross, it looks "like an underwater shrine"--and vessels sunk during the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests. Most of the photographs and other illustrations (there are more than 150 in total) are contemporary pictures taken during the war, from a blurry image of Japanese battleships heading toward Pearl Harbor before the sneak attack to a sequential series of photos showing a kamikaze plane approaching an American aircraft carrier, and then smashing into it. The text of the book moves back and forth between historical descriptions of the naval war and accounts of how Ballard found many of the ships lost during the fighting. His most significant discovery in the Pacific was probably the U.S.S. <i>Yorktown</i>, destroyed during the battle of Midway in 1942 and now resting 17,000 feet below the waves. The description of its dark, final resting place is eerie: It "looks like a huge craft dropped down from space, shorn of many of the antenna and cables and protrusions that had once made her serviceable, but now reduced to her core, which is still massive and formidable. ...[A] huge sunken sea-beast from another time, a steel dinosaur out of another era, when deluded men still thought they could conquer the world." As <i>Graveyards of the Pacific</i> proves once again, we are fortunate to have Ballard embarking on an altogether different kind of conquest. <i>--John Miller</i>&#34;Bob Ballard is one of the great explorers of the age.

Penkovsky may not, literally, have saved the world, this tellingly detailed saga reconfirms that the turncoat GRU colonel provided the West with priceless intelligence during the early 1960's, when the cold war very nearly turned hot. Drawing on hitherto unavailable transcripts of Penkovsky's debriefings by the CIA and the UK's MI6, Schecter (coauthor, Back in the U.S.S.R., etc.) and former KGB officer Deriabin (The KGB, 1989, etc.) deliver a fascinating rundown on a defector in place who wreaked incalculable havoc on the Soviet regime. With his own military career stalled by dint of a White Russian father who had fought the Bolsheviks, Penkovsky offered himself to the West as a ``soldier of freedom.'' Eventually accepted as a genuine apostate, he proved an astonishingly fertile source of accurate data on the USSR's nuclear capabilities, geopolitical aspirations, industrial priorities, and allied matters. Under his cover as a trade official, the GRU operative often traveled to London, Paris, and other points beyond the Socialist Bloc to talk with his Western contacts; otherwise, the high-ranking mole was obliged to pass on his espionage material (including exposed microfilm) at dead drops or embassy receptions in Moscow. Penkovsky's information proved invaluable to JFK in his confrontations with Khrushchev prior to the Berlin Wall, as well as during the Cuban missile crisis. In the meantime, however, Penkovsky took one risk too many and was arrested by the KGB and, following a show trial, executed in 1965. Having evaluated the theories advanced to explain Penkovsky's apprehension, the authors conclude that the truth won't be known until Kremlin files are opened. They leave little doubt, though, that their philandering, money-minded subject would probably have remained a loyal apparatchik had not his patrimony precluded his promotion to general. A fascinating portrait of a double agent whose active disaffection with the communist system helped consign it to history's dustbin. (Eight pages of photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>During the Cold War the CIA's premier agent in the Soviet Union was a high-level intelligence officer named Oleg Penkovsky. For two years in the early 1960s he supplied the CIA with highly classified information on Soviet rocket strength and strategic planning, information that assisted President Kennedy in his handling of the world's first nuclear confrontation, the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In the author's view, no spy in history has provided more useful material or had greater impact. Granted access to transcripts of Penkovsky's debriefings in Paris and London by U.S. and British intelligence, Schecter and Deriabin bring into focus for the first time Penkovsky's character and personality, his motivations for betraying his country, and the dimensions of the risks he took. The book concludes with a gripping account of how Penkovsky was caught by the KGB, his trial and 1963 execution. The authors call Penkovsky a fearless prophet whose heroism saved the world from nuclear war. A thoroughly good read, the book is rich in details of intelligence fieldcraft and specifics on how the CIA "ran" its operatives. Schecter is a former Time-Life bureau chief in Moscow; Deriabin, a former KGB official, defected to the West in 1954.

But when a husband-hunting debacle leaves her humiliated, she interviews for a staid governess position on a central Texas sheep ranch and vows to leave her romantic yearnings behind. <br><br>When Gideon Westcott left his privileged life in England to make a name for himself in America's wool industry, he never expected to become a father overnight. And five-year-old Isabella hasn't uttered a word since she lost her mother. The unconventionality of the new governess concerns Gideon--and intrigues him at the same time. But he can't afford distractions. He has a ranch to run, a shearing to oversee, and a suspicious fence-cutting to investigate. <br><br>When Isabella's uncle comes to claim the child--and her inheritance--Gideon and Adelaide must work together to protect Isabella from the man's evil schemes.

Karen lives in Abilene, Texas, with her husband and three children.Witemeyer follows her delightful first novel, A Tailor-Made Bride, with another tale of romance in America's West. Teacher Adelaide Proctor follows Henry Belcher to Fort Worth, Tex., but discovers her Prince Charming is a rogue. Instead of the marriage she planned, Adelaide becomes governess to Isabella, daughter of English-born sheep rancher Gideon Westcott. Adelaide comes to love both the mute, troubled Isabella and her father, but forces beyond their control are heading from England to Texas. Viscount Reginald Petchey wants his niece's fortune and will do anything to get it, even murder and kidnapping. But Petchey doesn't factor in Adelaide's determination and Gideon's love for his daughter. A final standoff is a nail-biter as a child's life and a family's future hang in the balance. Witemeyer's sophomore tale is entertaining and exciting, though fans may wish for the insightful discussions of her first. Readers won't be disappointed, however, in the strong, lovable Adelaide and her ultimate Prince Charming. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It begins by covering finance basics and the tools and techniques of financial quantification, using current industry examples to apply the principles of financial management to sport. It then goes beyond the basics to show how financial management works specifically in sport - how decisions are made to ensure wealth maximization. Discussions include debt and equity financing, capital budgeting, facility financing, economic impact, risk and return, time value of money, and more. The final section focuses on sport finance in three sectors of the industry - public sector sports, collegiate athletics, and professional sport-providing in-depth analysis of financial management in each sector. Sidebars, case studies, concept checks, and practice problems throughout provide practical applications of the material and enable thorough study and practice. <br><br>The business of sport has changed dynamically since the publication of the first edition, and this second edition reflects the impact of these changes on financial management in the sport industry. New to this edition are changes to reflect the global nature of sport (with, for example, discussions of income tax rates in the Premiere League), expanded material on the use of spreadsheets for financial calculations, a primer on accounting principles to help students interpret financial statements, a valuation case study assignment that takes students step by step through a valuation, a new stadium feasibility analysis using the efforts of the Oakland Raiders to obtain a new stadium, a new economic impact example focusing on the NBA All Star game, and much more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Matthew T.

Bandits at Sea offers a long-overdue corrective to the mythology and the mystique which has plagued the study of pirates and served to deny them their rightful legitimacy as subjects of investigation.</p> <p>With essays by the foremost scholars on these countercultural "social bandits"as Lingua Franca recently dubbed themthis collection examines various aspects of the phenomenon in the three main areas where it occurred: the Caribbean/Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and East Asia. We come to understand who pirates were, as well as the socio-economic contexts under which they developed and flourished.</p> <p>Comparisons between various types of piracy illustrate differences in practice and purpose between pirates of different areas; social histories, including examinations of women pirates and their historical significance and circumstances, offer similar insight into the personal lives of pirates from diverse regions. Far from serving as dens of thieves, pirate ships were often highly regulated microcosms of democracy. The crews of pirate vessels knew that majority rule, racial equality and equitable division of spoils were crucial for their survival, marking them as significantly more liberal than national governments.</p> <p>Scholars, students and a general audience ever intrigued by talesand now truthsof piracy on the high seas will welcome Bandits at Sea.</p></p><p><p>C.

Salka Viertel was all three and so much more. She was the screenwriter for five of Greta Garbo's movies and also her most intimate friend. At one point during the Irving Thalberg years, Viertel was the highest-paid writer on the MGM lot. Meanwhile, at her house in Santa Monica she opened her door on Sunday afternoons to scores of European �migr�s who had fled from Hitler&#x2014;such as Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, and Arnold Schoenberg&#x2014;along with every kind of Hollywood star, from Charlie Chaplin to Shelley Winters. In Viertel's living room (the only one in town with comfortable armchairs, said one Hollywood insider), countless cinematic, theatrical, and musical partnerships were born.<br><br>Viertel combined a modern-before-her-time sensibility with the Old-World advantages of a classical European education and fluency in eight languages. She combined great worldliness with great warmth. She was a true bohemian with a complicated erotic life, and at the same time a universal mother figure. A vital presence in the golden age of Hollywood, Salka Viertel is long overdue for her own moment in the spotlight.</p><p><b>Donna Rifkind</b>'s reviews appear frequently in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>New York Times Book Review</i>.

William Chittick translates into English for the first time certain aspects of Rumi&#x2019;s work. He selects and rearranges Rumi&#x2019;s poetry and prose in order to leave aside unnecessary complications characteristic of other English translations and to present Rumi&#x2019;s ideas in an orderly fashion, yet in his own words. Thorough, nontechnical introductions to each chapter, and selections that gradually present a greater variety of terms and images, make this work easily accessible to those interested in the spirituality of any tradition.</p><p>Text: English, Persian (translation)&#x201c;I consider this work to be of great importance in the field of Islamics in particular and of the humanities in general.

As far as I am aware of, it is the first work of its kind, providing the reader with a complete exposition of Rumi&#x2019;s fundamental notions through Rumi&#x2019;s own words.

Diseases such as Alzheimer's erase parts of one's memory but are also often said to erase the self. People don't simply die from such diseases; they are imagined, in the clich�s of our era, as vanishing in plain sight, fading away, or enduring a long goodbye. In <i>On Vanishing</i>, Lynn Casteel Harper, a Baptist minister and nursing home chaplain, investigates the myths and metaphors surrounding dementia and aging, addressing not only the indignities caused by the condition but also by the rhetoric surrounding it. Harper asks essential questions about the nature of our outsized fear of dementia, the stigma this fear may create, and what it might mean for us all to try to &#x201c;vanish well.&#x201d;<br>Weaving together personal stories with theology, history, philosophy, literature, and science, Harper confronts our elemental fears of disappearance and death, drawing on her own experiences with people with dementia both in the American healthcare system and within her own family. In the course of unpacking her own stories and encounters&#x2015;of leading a prayer group on a dementia unit; of meeting individuals dismissed as &#x201c;already gone&#x201d; and finding them still possessed of complex, vital inner lives; of witnessing her grandfather&#x2019;s final years with Alzheimer&#x2019;s and discovering her own heightened genetic risk of succumbing to the disease&#x2015;Harper engages in an exploration of dementia that is unlike anything written before on the subject.<br>Expanding our understanding of dementia beyond progressive vacancy and dread, <i>On Vanishing</i> makes room for beauty and hope, and opens a space in which we might start to consider better ways of caring for, and thinking about, our fellow human beings. It is a rich and startling work of nonfiction that reveals cognitive change as an essential aspect of what it means to be mortal.</p><p>Lynn Casteel Harper is a minister, chaplain, and essayist. Her work has appeared in <i>Kenyon Review</i> Online, <i>North American Review</i>, and <i>Catapult </i>magazine. She is a Barbara Deming Fund grant recipient and the winner of the 2017 <i>Orison Anthology</i> Prize in Nonfiction. She lives in New York City and is currently the minister of older adults at The Riverside Church.<b>Praise for <i>On Vanishing</i></b><br><br><p>"This inspiring work takes us far from our often-arrogant efforts to vanquish (cure) dementia to seeing human vanity in another light. How do we envision vanishing and disappearance in the face of progressive cognitive decline? In <i>On Vanishing</i>, Lynn Casteel Harper holds a mirror to society and asks us to reflect . . . Just what does dying with dementia tell us about the human condition, both in the details of individual lives and in the grand scope of society? . . . In these troubled times of environmental deterioration and social injustice, can we learn to create more compassionate civilizations that celebrate caring?" &#x2015;Peter J.

Included in their entirety are <i>Walden</i>, his indisputable masterpiece, and his two great arguments for nonconformity, <i>Civil Disobedience</i> and <i>Life Without Principle</i>. A lifetime of brilliant observation of nature--and of himself--is recorded in selections from <i>A Week On The Concord And Merrimack Rivers, Cape Cod, The Maine Woods</i> and <i>The Journal</i>.</p><p>Naturalist, philosopher, champion of self-reliance and moral independence, Henry David Thoreau remains not only one of our most influential writers but also one of our most contemporary. This unique and comprehensive edition gathers all of Thoreau's most significant works (including his masterpiece Walden, reproduced in its entirety). Taken together, they reveal the astounding range, subtlety, artistry, and depth of thought of this true American original. <br>Included in this Modern Library Paperback Classics edition are: Walden, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, selections from Cape Cod and The Maine Woods, "Walking," "Civil Disobedience," "Slavery in Massachusetts," "A Plea for Captain John Brown," and "Life Without Principle." <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>Henry David Thoreau was born July 12, 1817 - "just in the nick of time," as he wrote, for the "flowering of New England," when the area boasted such eminent citizens as Emerson, Hawthorne, Whitman and Melville. Raised in genteel poverty - his father made and sold pencils from their home - Thoreau enjoyed, nevertheless, a fine education, graduating from Harvard in 1837. In that year, the young thinker met Emerson and formed the close friendship that became the most significant of his life. Guided, sponsored and aided by his famous older colleague, Thoreau began to publish essays in The Dial, exhibiting the radical originality that would gain the disdain of his contemporaries but the great admiration of all succeeding generations. <br><br>In 1845, Thoreau began the living experiment for which he is most famous. During his two years and two months in the shack beside the New England pond, he wrote his first important work, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), was arrested for refusing to pay his poll tax to a government that supported slavery (recorded in "Civil Disobedience") and gathered the material for his masterpiece, Walden (1854). He spent the rest of his life writing and lecturing and died, relatively unappreciated, in 1862.</p><h2>Back to Eden Organic Gardening: Mastering Ways to Grow your Own Food (Homesteading Freedom)</h2><p>Back to Eden Gardening is the amazing stress-free, no-till farming method that will make your life a whole lot easier.

Roger Crowley's readable and comprehensive account of the battle between Mehmet II, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and Constantine XI, the 57th emperor of Byzantium, illuminates the period in history that was a precursor to the current conflict between the West and the Middle East.</p><p><strong>Roger Crowley</strong> was born in England and studied English at Cambridge University. After university, he taught English in Istanbul where he developed his interest in the city and its history. He has traveled widely throughout Turkey, including three journeys on foot across Western Anatolia, and has a working knowledge of Turkish. For the past fifteen years he has worked as a successful educational publisher for Nelson Thornes in Cheltenham, England.On May 29, 1453, Ottoman forces, under the leadership of Mehmet II, concluded their long and bloody siege of Constantinople by storming the city and overtaking it. According to Crowley, who works in publishing in England;the Ottoman conquest of the city brought to an end centuries of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and Islam. In overwhelming detail and colorless prose, Crowley chronicles the story of an ancient city and its attraction to members of two major religions. Before Mehmet's conquest, Constantinople had faced various unsuccessful sieges, and Crowley faithfully records them. The most destructive events came between 1341 and 1371, when earthquakes and the Black Death devastated the city, turning it into a forlorn series of villages. Although the Byzantine capital recovered enough of its former glory to entice Mehmet to its walls, even he felt tremendous disappointment, finding the city didn't live up to its reputation. Crowley drones through the day-by-day events of Mehmet's siege and the results of the conquest. Perhaps the author's most instructive point, made by others as well, is that Mehmet turned the city into one where religious toleration and multiculturalism flourished. <i>(Aug. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Volunteering their services to the British government, Barker and Llewelyn set out to infiltrate a secret cell of the Irish Republican Brotherhood known as the Invisibles. Posing as a reclusive German bomb maker and his anarchist apprentice, they are recruited for the group's ultimate plan: to bring London to its knees and end the monarchy forever. <br> <br> Their adventures take them from an abandoned lighthouse on the craggy coast of Wales to the City of Light, where Llewelyn goes undercover with Maire O'Casey, the alluring sister of an Irish radical. Llewelyn again finds himself put to the test by his enigmatic employer as he is schooled in the deadly science of bomb making. <br> <br> Fraught with explosives, secret initiations, and vicious stick fights, and featuring historical figures such as Charles Parnell and W.

The descriptions of the settings, ranging from cosmopolitan London and Liverpool to the desolate Welsh countryside, are masterfully drawn, and the lead characters and their comrades are burgeoning delightfully.

From these dire opening lines, a delightful story of adventure begins. One family will emerge alive from this terrible storm: the Robinson's -- a Swiss pastor, his wife, and four sons, plus two dogs and a shipload of livestock, hens, pigeons and geese! Inspired by Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Cruesoe," this heartwarming tale portrays a family's struggle to create a new life for themselves on a strange and fantastic tropical island. There each boy must learn to control his own nature -- such as Ernest's bookishness and Fritz's hot temper -- as their adventures lead to amazing discoveries, danger, and tantalizing surprises, including a puzzling message tied to an albatross's leg. But it is the authenticity of the boys' behavior, the ingenuity of the family, and the natural wonders of this exotic land that have made <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, first published in 1812-1813, one of the world's best-loved and most enduring stories of shipwreck and survival.Johann David Wyss (1743-1818) was a clergyman in Berne, Switzerland. A former military chaplain, Wyss spoke four languages, loved nature, and was deeply involved in the raising of his four boys, reading to them and taking them on hikes and hunting trips. To teach them moral lessons and entertain them, he read them a story he had written about a family just like theirs (each boy in the story is based on one of Wyss&#x2019;s four sons), who had been shipwrecked on a tropical island. This handwritten manuscript was more than eight hundred pages long and one of his sons, Johann Emmanuel, helped him illustrate it. Years later another son, Johann Rudolf, by then a professor at the Berne Academy, found his fathers manuscript, edited it, and published it in 1812-1813 as <b>The Swiss Family Robinson</b>. The first English translation appeared in 1814, and there have since been nearly two hundred versions of this novel, as well as two films and a television movie.</p><h2>Becoming a Health Care Professional</h2><p><p> <b> <i>BECOMING A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL</i> </b> is the ideal text for every student who is interested in exploring, planning, and preparing for a career in health care.

She examines the &#x201c;transgender gaze,&#x201d; as rendered in small art-house films like <i>By Hook or By Crook</i>, as well as figurations of ambiguous embodiment in the art of Del LaGrace Volcano, Jenny Saville, Eva Hesse, Shirin Neshat, and others.

With such a flippant<br>title, my talk was not likely to attract many listeners. Still, the<br>change left me slightly uneasy &#x2013; since, strictly speaking, I am not a historian<br>&#x2013; and I am glad to be able now to relinquish the false advertisement<br>of which I was somehow guilty.<br>&nbsp;<br>My article carries three epigraphs. Most lectures, addresses &#x2013; and<br>essays &#x2013; are usually forgettable. Epigraphs should be memorable. My<br>readers will naturally forget this article, but they should remember the<br>epigraphs. The first one is by a painter, the second one by a philosopher.<br>the third one by a poet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Painters, philosophers, poets, creative writers &#x2013; and also inventors<br>and scientists &#x2013; all reach truth by taking imaginative short-cuts. Let us<br>consider some of these.<br>&nbsp;<br>Plato's dialogues remain the cornerstone of all Western philosophy.<br>Very often what we find at their core is not discursive reasoning but various<br>myths - short philosophical parables. Myth is the oldest and richest<br>form of fiction. It performs an essential function: 'what myth<br>communicates is not truth but reality; truth is always about something&#x2014;<br>reality is what truth is about' (C.S. Lewis).<br>&nbsp;<br>At roughly the same time as Plato in the West, ancient Daoist thinkers<br>in China also expressed their ideas in imaginative form. On the subject<br>that occupies us here &#x2013; how do our minds reach truth &#x2013; there is one<br>tale in Lie Zi that seems illuminating and fundamental.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the time of the Warring States, horses were very important for<br>military reasons. The feudal lords employed the services of experts to<br>find good ones. Best of all was the super-horse (<i>qian-li ma</i>), an animal<br>which could run a thousand miles a day without leaving tracks and without<br>raising dust. Super-horses were most sought after, but they were<br>also very rare and hard to detect. Hence the need for highly specialized<br>experts; most famous among these was a man called Bole. Eventually<br>Bole became too old to pursue his field trips prospecting for super-horses.<br>Thus his employer, the Duke of Qin, asked him if he could recommend<br>another expert to carry on with this task. 'Yes,' said Bole. 'I<br>have a friend, a pedlar of firewood in the market, who is quite a connoisseur<br>of horses. ' Following Bole's advice. the duke dispatched this man<br>on a mission to find a super-horse. Three months later, the man<br>returned and reported to the duke: 'I have found one; it is in such-and-such<br>a place; it's a brown mare.' The duke sent his people to fetch the<br>animal, which proved to be a black stallion. The duke was not happy and<br>summoned Bole: That friend of yours &#x2013; he does not seem to be much<br>of an expert: he could not even get the animal's sex and colour right!'<br>On hearing this, Bole was amazed: <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fantastic! He is even better than myself, a hundred, a thousand<br>times better than myself! What he perceives is the innermost nature<br>of the animal. He looks for and sees what he needs to see. He ignores<br>what he does not need to see. Not distracted by external appearances,<br>he goes straight to the inner essence. The way he judges<br>horses shows that he should be judge of more important things than<br>horses.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And, needless to say, this particular animal proved to be a super-horse<br>indeed, a horse that could run a thousand miles a day without leaving<br>tracks and without raising dust.<br>&nbsp;<br>In reflecting on the ways by which our minds apprehend truth, you<br>may feel that a 2300-year-old Chinese parable is of only limited relevance.<br>But if so, let us consider something closer to hand: the mental<br>processes followed by modern Western science.<br>&nbsp;<br>Claude Bernard, the great pathologist whose research and discoveries<br>were of momentous importance in the development of modern<br>medical science, one day entered the lecture hall where he was going to<br>teach and noticed something peculiar: various trays were on a table,<br>containing different human organs; on one of these trays, flies had gathered.<br>A common mind would have made a common observation, perhaps<br>deploring a lack of cleanliness in the room or instructing the<br>janitor to keep the windows shut. But Bernard's was not a common<br>mind: he observed that the flies had gathered on the tray which contained<br>livers &#x2013; and he thought, There must be sugar there. And he discovered<br>the glycogenic function of the liver &#x2013; a discovery that proved<br>decisive for the understanding and treatment of diabetes.<br>&nbsp;<br>I found this anecdote not in any history of medical science, but in<br>the diaries of the greatest modern French poet, Paul Claudel. And<br>Claudel commented: 'This mental process is identical to that of poetical<br>writing ... The impelling motion is the same. Which shows that the primary<br>source of scientific thought is not reasoning, but the precise verification<br>of an association <i>originally</i> <i>supplied by the imagination</i>.'<br>&nbsp;<br>Note that when I refer to 'poetry', I am taking this word in its most<br>fundamental sense. Samuel Johnson, in his monumental dictionary of<br>the English language, assigns three definitions to the word ' poet', in<br>decreasing order of importance: first, 'an inventor'; second, 'an author<br>of fiction'; and last, 'a writer of poems.'<br>&nbsp;<br>Truth is grasped by an imaginative leap. This applies not only to<br>scientific thinking but also to philosophical thought. When I was a<br>naive young student in the first year of university, our Arts course<br>included the study of philosophy - a prospect that excited me much at<br>first, though I was soon disappointed by the mediocrity of our lecturer.<br>However, through family acquaintances I had the good fortune to<br>know personally an eminent philosopher of our time, who happened to<br>be also a kind and generous man. On my request, he drafted for me a<br>list of basic readings: one handwritten page with bibliographic references<br>of a selection of classic texts, modern works, histories of philosophy<br>and introductions to philosophy. I treasured this document; yet,<br>over the years, wandering round the world, I misplaced it and, like<br>many other treasures, eventually lost it. Now, half a century later, I<br>have long forgotten the actual items on the list. What I still remember<br>is the postscript the great philosopher had inscribed at the bottom of<br>that page - I remember it vividly because, at the time, I did not understand<br>it and it puzzled me. The postscript said (underlined), 'Most<br>important of all, don't forget: do read a lot of novels.' When I first read<br>this note, as an immature student, it shocked me. Somehow it did not<br>sound serious enough. For, naively, we tend to confuse what is serious<br>with what is deep. (In the editorial pages of our newspapers, leading<br>articles are serious, while cartoons are funny; yet quite often the cartoon<br>is deep and the leader is vapid.) It took me a long time to appreciate<br>the full wisdom of my philosopher's advice; now I frequently<br>encounter echoes of it. And to the observation I have already quoted<br>elsewhere, that one should prefer a medical practitioner who reads<br>Chekhov, I would add that, if I commit a crime, I hope to be judged by<br>a judge who has read Simenon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Men of action - people who are totally involved in tackling what<br>they believe to be real life - tend to dismiss poetry and all forms of<br>creative writing as a frivolous distraction. Our great Polar explorer<br>Mawson wrote in a letter to his wife some instructions concerning<br>their children's education. He insisted that they should not waste their<br>time reading novels, but should instead acquire factual information<br>from books of history and biography.<br>&nbsp;<br>This view - quite prevalent, actually - that there is an essential difference<br>between works of imagination on the one hand, and records of<br>facts and events on the other, is very naive. At a certain depth or a certain<br>level of quality, all writings tend to be creative writing, for they all<br>partake of the same essence: poetry.<br>&nbsp;<br>History (contrary to the common view) does not record events. It<br>merely records echoes of events - which is a very different thing - and,<br>in doing this, it must rely on imagination as much as on memory. Memory<br>by itself can only accumulate data, pointlessly and meaninglessly.<br>Remember Jorge Luis Borges' philosophical parable 'Funes the Memorious'. <br>Funes is a young man who, falling on his head from a horse<br>becomes strangely crippled: his memory hyper-develops, he is deprived<br>of any ability to forget, he remembers everything; his mind becomes a<br>monstrous garbage dump cluttered and clogged with irrelevant data, a<br>gigantic heap of unrelated images and disconnected instants; he cannot<br>evacuate any fragment of past experiences, however trifling. This relentless<br>capacity for absolute and continuous recollection is a curse; it<br>excludes all possibility of thought. For thinking requires space m which<br>to forget, to select, to delete and to isolate what is significant. If you cannot<br>discard any item from the memory store, you cannot <i>abstract</i> and<br>generalize. But without abstraction and generalization, there can be no<br>thought. <br>&nbsp;<br>The historian does not merely record; he edits, he omits, he judges,<br>he interprets, he reorganizes, he composes. His mission is nothing less<br>than 'to render the highest kind of justice to the visible universe, by<br>bringing to light the truth, manifold and one, underlying its every<br>aspect'. Yet this quote is not from a historian discussing history writing;<br>it is from a novelist on the art of fiction: it is the famous beginning of<br>Joseph Conrad's preface to <i>The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</i>, a true manifesto of<br>the novelist's mission.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact is, these two arts - history writing and fiction writing -<br>originating both in poetry, involve similar activities and mobilize the<br>same faculties: memory and imagination; and this is why it could rightly<br>be said that the novelist is the historian of the present and the historian of<br>the novelist of the past. Both must invent the truth. <br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, accuracy of data is the pre-condition of any historical<br>work. But in the end, what determines the quality of a historian is the<br>quality of his judgment. Two historians may be in possession of the<br>same data; what distinguishes them is what they make of their common<br>information. For example, on the subject of convict Australia, Robert<br>Hughes gathered a wealth of material which he presented in his <i>Fatal</i><br><i>Shore</i> in a vivid and highly readable style. On the basis of that same<br>information, however, Geoffrey Blainey drew a conclusion that is radically<br>different &#x2013; and much more convincing. Hughes had likened convict<br>Australia to the 'Gulag Archipelago' of the Soviet Union, but Blamey<br>pointed out that whereas the Soviet Gulag was a totally sterile machine<br>designed solely to crush and destroy its inmates, in Australia, out of a<br>convict system that was also brutal and ferocious, a number of individuals<br>emerged full of vigour and ambition, who rose to become some of<br>their country's richest citizens. In turn, they soon generated a dynamic<br>society and, eventually, a vibrant young democracy What matters most<br>in the end is how the historian reads events - and this is where his judgment<br>is put to the test.<br>&nbsp;<br>To reach the truth of the past, historians must overcome specific<br>obstacles: they have to gather information that is not always readily<br>available. In this sense, they must master the methods of a specialized<br>discipline. But to understand the truth of the present time, right in<br>front of us, is not the preserve of historians; it is our common task. How<br>do we usually cope with it? Not too well, it seems.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let us consider just two examples - still quite close to us, and of<br>colossal dimensions. The twentieth century was a hideous century<br>filled with horrors on a gigantic scale. In sheer magnitude, the terror<br>perpetrated by modern totalitarianisms was unprecedented. It developed<br>essentially in two varieties: Stalinist and Hitlerian.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we read the writings of Soviet and East European dissidents<br>and exiles, we are struck by one recurrent theme: their amazement,<br>indignation and anger in the face of the stupidity, ignorance and indifference<br>of Western opinion and especially of the Western intelligentsia,<br>which remained largely incapable of registering the reality of their predicament.<br>And yet the Western countries were spending huge resources,<br>both to gather intelligence and to develop scholarly research on the<br>communist world - all to very little avail. Robert Conquest, one of the<br>very few Sovietologists who was clear-sighted from the start, experienced<br>acute frustration in his attempts to share and communicate his<br>knowledge. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, his publisher<br>proposed to reissue a collection of his earlier essays and asked him what<br>title he would suggest. Conquest thought for one second and said, 'How<br>about <i>I Told You So, You Fucking Fools?&#x2019;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Interestingly enough, the name of one writer appears again and<br>again in the writings of the dissidents from the communist world &#x2013; they<br>pay homage to him as the only author who fully perceived the concrete<br>reality of their condition, down to its very sounds and smells &#x2013; and this<br>is George Orwell.

How does it feel to hold someone&#39;s life in your hands, to cut through the stuff that creates thought, feeling and reason? How do you live with the consequences when it all goes wrong? DO NO HARM offers an unforgettable insight into the highs and lows of a life dedicated to operating on the human brain, in all its exquisite complexity. With astonishing candour and compassion, Henry Marsh reveals the exhilarating drama of surgery, the chaos and confusion of a busy modern hospital, and above all the need for hope when faced with life&#39;s most agonising decisions.</p><p>Henry Marsh read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University before studying medicine at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1984 and was appointed Consultant Neurosurgeon at Atkinson Morley&#39;s/St George&#39;s Hospital in London in 1987, where he still works full time. He has been the subject of two major documentary films, YOUR LIFE IN THEIR HANDS, which won the ROYAL TELEVISION SOCIETY GOLD MEDAL, and THE ENGLISH SURGEON, featuring his work in the Ukraine, which won an EMMY. He was made a CBE in 2010. He is married to the anthropologist and writer Kate Fox.

He acknowledges that surgeons are arrogant, that they play God, but that they are also afflicted by despair, sorrow and doubt. He is scathing on NHS bureaucracy and his picture of doctors doing their best but basically flailing in the dark made me respect the profession more -- Nick Curtis * EVENING STANDARD * Marsh has written a book about a love affair, and one cannot help feeling similarly smitten . . . &#39;Elegant, delicate, dangerous and full of profound meaning&#39;. All four of those epithets might describe this book -- Ed Caesar * THE SUNDAY TIMES * A strikingly honest and humane account of what it means to hold the power of life and death in your hands . . . elegant, edifying and necessary -- Erica Wagner * NEW STATESMAN &#39;Books of the Year&#39; * A mesmerising, at times painful journey through a neurosurgeon&#39;s extraordinary career. As delicate as he can be brutal, Marsh&#39;s account of himself is always honest and moving. Human frailty at its strongest -- Jessie Burton, author of THE MINIATURIST As gripping and engrossing as the best medical drama, only with the added piquancy of being entirely true, this compelling account of what it&#39;s really like to be a brain surgeon will have you on the edge of your sunlounger -- Sandra Parsons * DAILY MAIL * When a book opens like this: &#34;I often have to cut into the brain and it is something I hate doing&#34; - you can&#39;t let it go, you have to read on, don&#39;t you? . . . I trust completely the skills of those who practise [brain surgery], and tend to forget the human element, which is failures, misunderstandings, mistakes, luck and bad luck . . . Do No Harm by Henry Marsh reveals all of this, in the midst of life-threatening situations, and that&#39;s one reason to read it; true honesty in an unexpected place -- Karl Ove Knausgard * FINANCIAL TIMES * Henry Marsh . . . sets a new standard for telling it like it is . . . His love for brain surgery and his patients shines through, but the specialty - shrouded in secrecy and mystique when he entered it - has now firmly had the rug pulled out from under it. We should thank Henry Marsh for that -- Phil Hammond * THE TIMES * Offers an astonishing glimpse into this stressful career. This is a wonderful book, passionate and frank. If Marsh is even a tenth as good a neurosurgeon as he is a writer, I&#39;d let him open my skull any time -- Leyla Sanai * INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY * Riveting . . . extraordinarily intimate, compassionate and sometimes frightening . . . [Marsh] writes with uncommon power and frankness * NEW YORK TIMES * Incredibly absorbing . . . an astonishingly candid insight -- Bill Bryson [Do No Harm] simply tells the stories, with great tenderness, insight and self-doubt . . . Why haven&#39;t more surgeons written books, especially of this prosaic beauty? Well, thank God for Henry Marsh . . . What a bloody, splendid book: commas optional -- Euan Ferguson * OBSERVER * An elegant series of meditations at the closing of a long career. Many of the stories are moving enough to raise tears, but at the heart this is a book about wisdom and experience -- Nicholas Blincoe * DAILY TELEGRAPH * An enthralling read . . . a testimony of wonder . . . Marsh&#39;s style is admirably clear, concise and precise . . There is no forcing of a narrative arc or a happy ending, just the quotidian frustrations, sorrows, regrets and successes of neurosurgical life -- Gavin Francis * GUARDIAN * Neurosurgery has met its Boswell in Henry Marsh. Painfully honest about the mistakes that can &#39;wreck&#39; a brain, exquisitely attuned to the tense and transient bond between doctor and patient, and hilariously impatient of hospital management, Marsh draws us deep into medicine&#39;s most difficult art and lifts our spirits.

He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle.</p><p>We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)&#x2014;on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness&#x2014;and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, <i>Apocolocyntosis</i> (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes.

The life and ideals of this humble, semiliterate medieval friar have had a shaping influence on the Christian church that has spilled over into Western culture at large. This biography by Lawrence Cunningham looks anew at Francis's life and legacy, seeking to counter efforts to romanticize him yet without diminishing his deep piety or abiding significance.<br><br>Pursuing a realistic view of the saint, Cunningham argues against common stereotypes that sentimentalize Francis as a "blesser of animals," as a "church rebel," or as a precursor of the "spirituality" movement. According to Cunningham, really seeing Francis requires the lens of theology rather than the lens of quaint spirituality so often used. Francis was a devotedly orthodox Catholic whose life must be understood as a response to reforming elements abroad in the church of his day. Francis's originality derived from his success in articulating the "ideal gospel life": his message and actions were a kind of "acting out" of the scriptures.<br><br>Imbued with peerless scholarship, this book is also charmingly written. Cunningham is a master storyteller as well as a brilliant biographer -- qualities that his&nbsp;<i>Francis of Assisi</i>&nbsp;fully displays. It will at once inform and delight anyone interested in the fascinating life of Francis or his impact on church history.</p><p>Lawrence S. Cunningham is John A. O'Brien Professor Emeritus of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. An acknowledged expert on St. Francis and Christian Spirituality, he is also the author of <em>The Catholic Faith: An Introduction</em> and the edito<b>America</b><br> "Lawrence S. Cunningham's small study of St. Francis demonstrates the value of sound critical judgment and solid theology for grounding healthy devotion to the saints and deepening the faith in the Christian realities to which they dedicated themselves. . . Cunningham's solid historical scholarship is omnipresent, although it is so smoothly and thoroughly integrated that the work is in no way pedantic, nor is there any trace of jargon or obfuscation."&nbsp;<b>First Things</b><br> "An engaging and informative contribution to the vast literature on the man commonly described as, next to the Virgin Mother, the most popular of saints. Among the merits of this little book is Cunningham's guide to that literature and his description of the frequently conflicting reasons through history for the celebration of Francis."&nbsp;<b>Catholic Historical Review</b><br> "A stimulating account of one of the most attractive figures in the history of Christendom. . . This study is one of the best and most perceptive portraits of the saint in recent years."&nbsp;<b>Wayne Hellmann</b><br> "Lawrence Cunningham's years of reflection on the sources of and about St. Francis of Assisi open new doors for understanding his spiritual significance. This book approaches Francis in the context of the Catholic reform tradition that he inherited and embraced. Cunningham demonstrates that this tradition is key to understanding Francis's originality &#x2014; a trait that continues to affirm Christian identity and provokes all toward the solidarity that God intended."&nbsp;<b>Bernard McGinn</b><br> "Among the scores of books devoted to Francis of Assisi, Lawrence Cunningham's stands out for its balance and insight. This beautifully written volume argues for a view of Francis as a spiritual classic, a devoted follower of Christ whose greatest joy was performing the gospel through a life of voluntary poverty and service to the poor.&nbsp;<i>Francis of Assisi: Performing the Gospel</i>&nbsp;is a gem. "&nbsp;<b>Cistercian Studies Quarterly</b><br> "This beautifully produced and beautifully written book by a well-known scholar and frequent write on Franciscan spirituality argues against the entirely too familiar sentimental image of Francis that is coterminous with what the author calls 'spirituality lite'? a spirituality disengaged from religion that comforts its practitioners rather than challenging them."</p><h2>Eric Sloane&#39;s Weather Book</h2><p><p>"Amateur weather forecasters (which includes just about everyone) will find this volume an informative and entertaining account of the why and how of the weather." -- <em>The Nation</em><br> In simple language, Eric Sloane explains the whys and wherefores of weather and weather forecasting -- and does it in a style that's universally appealing.<br> With humor and common sense shining through in a book that's also lively and informative, Sloane shows readers how to predict the weather by "reading" such natural phenomena as winds, skies, and animal sounds.

He teaches at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. </p>How elements of the Maya creation myth can be found in ancient Maya art as well as in today's Maya folk culture. In A Forest of Kings (1990), Freidel (Archaeology/Southern Methodist University) and Schele (Art/University of Texas at Austin) shared their extensive knowledge lucidly; here, working with writing-instructor Parker, they go astray, throwing in occasional (mostly superficial) material on the shamanic tradition, awkwardly personalizing their intellectual quest. The authors claim to reverse the idea that the Conquest destroyed links between ancient Maya civilization and contemporary Maya. In fact, cultural survivals have long been documented, but Freidel and Schele do quite brilliantly recognize in detail previously unsuspected imagery and symbolic systems that connect present-day practice to ancient myth. Finding that creation myths parallel celestial events, Schele concludes that ``every major image from Maya cosmic symbolism was probably a map of the sky.'' (Interpretations here will fascinate enthusiasts of Giorgio De Santillana and Hertha Von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill, 1969, which contended that myth has an astronomical/cosmological, rather than historical, basis). The authors generously share credit with colleagues, unfortunately studding the already dense text with names of individuals and institutions. Attempts to dramatize the creative process fall flat (``One afternoon, Nikolai had arrived late after meetings in Guatemala City to find a contemplative Linda brooding over the structure of this very chapter''). Moreover, perhaps for political reasons, the recent Maya genocide is barely referred to, while the current cultural revival (in which the authors have played a role) is mentioned but left tantalizingly unexplored. Frustrating, irritating, hard to read--and not for the New Age audience the subtitle seems chosen to attract. Those with a serious interest in Maya myth, symbol, and art, though, can excavate much of value here. (Illustrations--250, including 24 pages color) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

S. Eliot Prize. In 2008, he won the National Book Award for <em>Fire to Fire: New and Selected Poems</em>. He is a professor at the University of Houston, and he lives in New York City. </p>Asking, ``What does a writer do, when the world collapses, but write?,'' Doty, whose world collapsed when his lover died, gives an answer that's both generous and indulgent. In a look back at the period before, during, and after Wally Roberts succumbed to complications of AIDS, the author (a winner of the National Book Critics Circle award for poetry) walks a path between the practical and the poetic, the enraged and the calm. On one hand, he's got helpful observations for support partners--``The lower one goes in the medical system, it seems, the more humanity, the more hands-on help, the more genuine care.'' On the other, he's ready to turn profound on death's many approaching moments, especially its final one--``. . . he is most himself, even if that self empties out into no one, swift river hurrying into the tumble of rivers, out of individuality, into the great rushing whirlwind of currents.'' Putting the puzzle of his life back together after Roberts's demise upset it, Doty returns to the Boston house where the proud and very out pair first lived together (but in separate apartments); recalls the Vermont homes they shared; and fills in the final Provincetown years. He visits landscapes here and abroad, finding reminders--and metaphors and avatars--of their relationship wherever he looks. He also writes with love about the friends who filled the couple's days with joy and anxiety (a self-destructive poet identified only as Lynda particularly delights and infuriates Doty). He commemorates Arden and Beau, two rollicking dogs who kept things much happier than they might otherwise have been. A poet with a quick memory for poems he didn't write, Doty is angry at the realities of the world when it unleashes physical and moral diseases, and grateful when it shows a kinder face. A book very much like grief itself in that it's sometimes awkward, often uncontrolled, and always deeply felt. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Mediterranean Heart Diet does what most doctors who recommend the diet don&#39;t: spells out which foods are &#34;out&#34; and which are &#34;in,&#34; and why.Doctors recommend a Mediterranean eating style to thousands who are diagnosed each year with heart disease because it is &#34;heart-healthy&#34;-it promotes lower saturated-fat consumption, and helps lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels. It is an all-purpose style of eating that also benefits those at risk of developing certain cancers and those with a diabetic condition, because it is high in antioxidant-rich foods and whole grains. The Mediterranean Heart Diet not only provides a full range of satisfying recipes but also covers the science behind the diet&#39;s health benefits. Readers learn to create their own healthful eating plans and establish new habits.More than 140 delicious recipes are included, from satisfying Lentil and Broccoli Soup to tangy Halibut in Citrus Sauce. All recipes feature nutritional analysis by serving, including food exchanges.</p><p><b>Helen V. Fisher</b> has written several cookbooks and recently has worked with doctors and dietitians to create health books with recipe components. <b>Cynthia Thomson, Ph.D., R.D.</b>, is a clinical nutrition research specialist at the Arizona Cancer Center at the University of Arizona. Both authors live in Tuscon, Arizona.The Mediterranean diet is certainly one of the better nutritional gimmicks embraced by the American public. Fisher explains the medical rationale behind this popular diet and provides details on the diet and exercise combination, which has been proven to be healthier than the American way of life. Mediterranean fare is highlighted through the use of a modified food pyramid that emphasizes breads, pasta, rice, and whole-grain foods. Phytochemicals, the foods in which they are contained, and their potential benefits are discussed. Over 140 recipes, including appetizers, soups, salads, grains, seafood, meats, vegetable, breads, and desserts, are simple and appealing.

Both a weeper and a thinker, the book tells the story of two French sisters &#x2013; one in Paris, one in the countryside &#x2013; during WWII; each is crippled by the death of their beloved mother and cavalier abandonment of their father; each plays a part in the French underground; each finds a way to love and forgive. If this sounds sudsy. . . well, it is, a little. . . but a melodrama that combines historical accuracy (Hannah has said her inspiration for Isabelle was the real life story of a woman who led downed Allied soldiers on foot over the Pyrenees) and social/political activism is a hard one to resist. Even better to keep you turning pages: the central conceit works &#x2013; the book is narrated by one of the sisters in the present, though you really don&#x2019;t know until the very end which sister it is. Fast-paced, detailed, and full of romance (both the sexual/interpersonal kind and the larger, trickier romance of history and war), this novel is destined to land (sorry, again) on the top of best sellers lists and night tables everywhere. <i>-- Sara Nelson </i></p><p><b>Kristin Hannah</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of novels including <i>Night Road</i>, <i>Firefly Lane</i>, <i>True Colors</i> and <i>Winter Garden</i>.

Vasari&#39;s original and soaring vision plus his acute aesthetic judgements have made him one of the most influential art historians of all time.</p><p>Giorgio Vasari (1511-74) was an accomplished painter and architect, but it is for his illuminating biographies of artists that he is best remembered.

In RAPID DEVELOPMENT, author Steve McConnell addresses that concern head-on with overall strategies, specific best practices, and valuable tips that help shrink and control development schedules and keep projects moving. Inside, you&#x2019;ll find:<br> </p><ul> <li>A rapid-development strategy that can be applied to any project and the best practices to make that strategy work </li><li>Candid discussions of great and not-so-great rapid-development practices&#x2014;estimation, prototyping, forced overtime, motivation, teamwork, rapid-development languages, risk management, and many others </li><li>A list of classic mistakes to avoid for rapid-development projects, including creeping requirements, shortchanged quality, and silver-bullet syndrome </li><li>Case studies that vividly illustrate what can go wrong, what can go right, and how to tell which direction your project is going </li><li>RAPID DEVELOPMENT is the real-world guide to more efficient applications development.</li></ul></p><p>I can hear some of you exclaiming, "How can you possibly recommend a book about software scheduling published by Microsoft Press and written by a consultant to Microsoft?!" Well, put aside any preconceived biases. This is a tremendous book on effective scheduling software development, and it drinks deeply from the wisdom of all the classics in the field such as Brook's <i>Mythical Man Month</i> -- and is likely well-informed by McConnell's experiences, good and bad, in Redmond. <p> The nine page section entitled "Classic Mistakes Enumerated" is alone worth the price of admission and should be required reading for all developers, leads, and managers. Here are some types of the 36 classic mistakes that McConnell describes in detail: </p><p> </p><ul> <li>People Related Mistakes <ul> <li>Heroics </li><li>Adding people to a late project </li><li>Politics placed over substance (etc.) </li></ul> <br> </li><li>Process Related Mistakes <ul> <li>Abandonment of planning under pressure </li><li>Planning to catch up later </li><li>"Code-like-hell" programming (etc.) </li></ul> <br> </li><li>Technology Related Mistakes <ul> <li>Silver-Bullet syndrome </li><li>Overestimating savings from new tools or methods </li><li>Switching tools in the middle of a project (etc.) </li></ul> </li></ul> <p> I suspect that if you've ever been involved in software development, you winced after reading each of these nine points. And you will learn a great deal from the remaining 640 pages about concrete solutions. </p><p> My only substantive gripe: cheesy Powerpoint graphics. Nonetheless, this book is Very Highly Recommended.</p><p>Steve McConnell is recognized as one of the premier authors and voices in the development community.

His music, insistent and straightforward, resists labels and seethes with a tension that resonates with musicians, scholars, and audiences today. Eastman&#39;s provocative titles, including Gay Guerrilla, Evil Nigger, Crazy Nigger, and others, assault us with his obsessions. Eastman tested limits with his political aggressiveness, as reflected in legendary scandals like his June 1975 performance of John Cage&#39;s Song Books, which featured homoerotic interjections, and the uproar over his titles at Northwestern University. These episodes are examples of Eastman&#39;s persistence in pushing the limits of the acceptable in the highly charged arenas of sexual and civil rights. In addition to analyses of Eastman&#39;s music, the essays in Gay Guerrilla provide background on his remarkable life history and the era&#39;s social landscape. The book presents an authentic portrait of a notable American artist that is compelling reading for the general reader as well as scholars interested in twentieth-century American music, American studies, gay rights, and civil rights. Ren�e Levine Packer&#39;s book This Life of Sounds: Evenings for New Music in Buffalo received an ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for excellence. Mary Jane Leach is a composer and freelance writer, currently writing music and theatre criticism for the Albany Times-Union.</p><p>Julius Eastman enjoyed the admiration of peers such as Morton Feldman, Meredith Monk and Pierre Boulez. Here, highly engaging essays by those who knew Eastman well recall him as a person and assess his brilliance. While there are amusing anecdotes about his more madcap moments...the overall message is that he was an artist deserving of significant respect. BBC MUSIC MAGAZINE (Eastman&#39;s work) effectively rewrote the history of post-war American New Music, restoring to its narrative a gay black voice creating a liberating, high-energy form of organic minimalism. THE GUARDIAN It is eminently readable throughout. JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MUSIC STUDIES (The book will be) a starting point for others who want to engage with Julius Eastman as a performer, scholar, or composer. ARSC JOURNAL A picture of (Eastman)--charismatic performer, magnetic personality and emotional escape artist--that puts his work in a context larger and more representative. BAY AREA REPORTER A composer of visionary power, a singer with a cavernous bass voice, a collaborator with the diverse likes of Meredith Monk and Pierre Boulez, Eastman had long been a fixture of the New York Music scene....Part of the pleasure of Eastman&#39;s rediscovery has been the belated, deserving reinsertion of a black, gay figure into music history. THE NEW YORK TIMES Outspoken about his own identity as a black queer man...Eastman was ahead of his time. His music is politics by other means, in search of a form, alighting toward a future that could grant him dignity, when he could be something other than an abstraction.THE NEW YORKER A fascinating new collection of essays exploring the life and work of the enigmatic composer Julius Eastman...who worked fluently in jazz, improvisation and acoustical experiments. An indication of his impact is the very fact that so many people have come together (in this book) to remember him and are actively championing his music. ALBANY TIMES-UNION The publication of this rigorously researched, lovingly produced, multidimensional study of a singular artist will surely be met with joy by those of us who remember Julius Eastman--the inspired creator, the sly provocateur and martyred saint of the avant-garde. For those who are interested in iconoclasts of whatever stripe, this volume will be a revelation and an invitation to rethink what composition, performance, and life at the precipice of madness can be.--Bill T. Jones, choreographer and dancer This book has arrived just in time for Black Lives Matter and gets my deepest praise. This important volume of essays brought forth by two brilliant women who have long championed Eastman&#39;s music, belongs in every music conservatory library and beyond.--Pauline Oliveros, composer</p><h2>Stettin Station (A John Russell WWII Spy Thriller)</h2><p>In the fall of 1941, Anglo-American journalist John Russell is still living in Berlin, tied to the increasingly alien city by his love for two Berliners: his fourteen-year-old son, Paul, and his longtime girlfriend, Effi.

From the moment Frank and Joe find a radioactive engine in an airplane junkyard, unexpected dangers strike like lightning. Despite the repeated attempts on their lives, the teenage detectives pursue their investigation, discovering two vital clues and others that provide the solution to one of the most baffling mysteries the boys and Mr. Hardy have ever encountered.</p><p>Franklin W.

After decades of neglect, Colquhoun's unique vision and hermetic life have become an object of great renewed interest, both for artists and for historians of magic. </p><p>Although her painting are paintings represented in such major collections as Tate Britain and the National Portrait Gallery, Colquhoun's rejection of both avant-garde and occult orthodoxies resulted in a life of relative obscurity. Her visual and written works have only recently received adequate recognition as a precursor to contemporary experiments in magical autobiography and esoteric feminism.</p><p>After rejecting the hectic social expectations and magical orthodoxies of London's art and occult scenes, Colquhoun pursued a life of dedicated spiritual and artistic enquiry embodied in her retreat to Cornwall. <i>Genius of the Fern Loved Gully</i> balances engaging biography with art historical erudition and critical insight into the magical systems that underscored her art and writing.</p></p><p>Amy Hale is an anthropologist who specializes in contemporary occult and Pagan history, religions, and culture in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><h2>From Dictatorship to Democracy</h2><p>From Dictatorship to Democracy was a pamphlet, printed and distributed by Dr Gene Sharp and based on his study, over a period of forty years, on non-violent methods of demonstration. Now in its fourth edition, it was originally handed out by the Albert Einstein Institution, and although never actively promoted, to date it has been translated into thirty-one languages. This astonishing book travelled as a photocopied pamphlet from Burma to Indonesia, Serbia and most recently Egypt, Tunisia and Syria, with dissent in China also reported. Surreptitiously handed out amongst youth uprisings the world over - how the &#39;how-to&#39; guide came about and its role in the recent Arab uprisings is an extraordinary tale. Once read you&#39;ll find yourself urging others to read it and indeed want to gift it.</p><p>Gene Sharp holds degrees from universities across the world. He is Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. He was previously at Harvard University&#39;s Center for International Affairs. For his lifelong commitment to the defence of freedom, democracy, and the reduction of political violence he was awarded the Courage of Conscience award in 2008. He is a Nobel Peace Prize nominee.A book that must be read. It is scholarly, readable and highly relevant at a time when so many people are challenging the dictatorships under which they live. With his long historical understanding he offers really useful advice to people who are engaged on the same task today -- Tony Benn Sharp&#39;s contribution to the struggle for non-violence protest in the Arab world has been immense. After many years of persistent effort he has been fully vindicated. -- Raja Shehadeh</p><h2>The Edge of Anarchy: The Railroad Barons, the Gilded Age, and the Greatest Labor Uprising in America</h2><p><p>"Timely and urgent...The core of <i>The Edge of Anarchy</i> is a thrilling description of the boycott of Pullman cars and equipment by Eugene Debs&#x2019;s fledgling American Railway Union..." &#x2015;<i><b>The New York Times</b></i></p><p>"During the summer of 1894, the stubborn and irascible Pullman became a central player in what the New York Times called &#x201c;the greatest battle between labor and capital [ever] inaugurated in the United States.&#x201d; Jack Kelly tells the fascinating tale of that terrible struggle." &#x2015;<b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>"Pay attention, because <i>The Edge of Anarchy</i> not only captures the flickering Kinetoscopic spirit of one of the great Labor-Capital showdowns in American history, it helps focus today&#x2019;s great debates over the power of economic concentration and the rights and futures of American workers."<b> &#x2015;Brian Alexander, author of </b><b><i>Glass House</i></b></p><p>"In gripping detail, <i>The Edge of Anarchy</i> reminds us of what a pivotal figure Eugene V. Debs was in the history of American labor... a tale of courage and the steadfast pursuit of principles at great personal risk." &#x2015;<b>Tom Clavin, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Dodge City</i></b><br><b></b><br><b>The dramatic story of the explosive 1894 clash of industry, labor, and government that shook the nation and marked a turning point for America.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b><i>The Edge of Anarchy</i> by Jack Kelly offers a vivid account of the greatest uprising of working people in American history. At the pinnacle of the Gilded Age, a boycott of Pullman sleeping cars by hundreds of thousands of railroad employees brought commerce to a standstill across much of the country. Famine threatened, riots broke out along the rail lines. Soon the U.S. Army was on the march and gunfire rang from the streets of major cities. </p><p>This epochal tale offers fascinating portraits of two iconic characters of the age. George Pullman, who amassed a fortune by making train travel a pleasure, thought the model town that he built for his workers would erase urban squalor. Eugene Debs, founder of the nation&#x2019;s first industrial union, was determined to wrench power away from the reigning plutocrats. The clash between the two men&#x2019;s conflicting ideals pushed the country to what the U.S. Attorney General called &#x201c;the ragged edge of anarchy.&#x201d;</p><p>Many of the themes of<i> The Edge of Anarchy</i> could be taken from today&#x2019;s headlines&#x2015;upheaval in America&#x2019;s industrial heartland, wage stagnation, breakneck technological change, and festering conflict over race, immigration, and inequality. With the country now in a New Gilded Age, this look back at the violent conflict of an earlier era offers illuminating perspectives along with a breathtaking story of a nation on the edge.</p></p><p>JACK KELLY is a journalist, novelist, and historian, whose books include Band of Giants, which received the DAR&#39;s History Award Medal, and Heaven&#39;s Ditch.

He has appeared on The History Channel and been interviewed on National Public Radio. He lives in New York&#39;s Hudson Valley.<p>"What used to be our middle class is up against what Debs was up against in 1893. Jack Kelly's crisp retelling of the Pullman strike helps you understand why there is not much of a labor movement&#x2015;or socialism&#x2015;in America. Today it would now be even harder now to pull off a strike so big and threatening as one the Kelly describes here in such fast moving detail." &#x2015;Tom Geoghegan, author of <i>Which Side Are You On?: Trying to Be for Labor When It's Flat on Its Back</i></p><p>"Timely...Kelly tells this story with exhilaration...[<i>The Edge of Anarchy</i>] is not only a wonderful distillation of why the 1894 Pullman strike still matters, but it also presents an excellent overview of what life was like in 1894&#x2015;full of technological promise, and yet riddled with class conflict and economic warfare." &#x2015;<i>New York Journal of Books</i><br><i></i><br>"Jack Kelly&#x2019;s work presents an era that, though passed from collective memory, still resonates today." &#x2015;<i>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></p><p>"It&#x2019;s an epic yarn and Jack Kelly tells it with Homeric power and sweep.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Times</i><br><i></i><br>"Masterful." &#x2015;<i>Railroad History</i></p><p>&#x201c;Kelly does a great job of telling a lively and readable story.&#x201d; &#x2015;Democratic Socialists of America </p><p>&#x201c;It takes a book like Kelly&#x2019;s to make history truly relevant to what we face today . . .

Debs: Citizen and Socialist</i><br><i></i><br>"Think Erik Larson meets Howard Zinn...Jack Kelly&#x2019;s remarkable new book, <i>Ragged Edge,</i> explores an era of our industrial and labor history with remarkable parallels to our own moment: ascendant forces of all-powerful capital, a government beholden to it, new labor movements emerging from the ashes of older ones, populist uprisings on the left and right, political polarization, and a working class divided to its detriment by issues of race and status. Kelly writes history with the storytelling prowess of a novelist or screenwriter, making forgotten subject matter newly accessible and exciting.

It spanned three seasons, 1983-85. It secured multiple television deals. It drew millions of fans and launched the careers of legends. But then it died beneath the weight of a particularly egotistical and bombastic owner&#x2014;a New York businessman named Donald J. Trump. The league featured as many as 18 teams, and included such superstars as Steve Young, Jim Kelly, Herschel Walker, Reggie White, Doug Flutie and Mike Rozier.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Football for a Buck</i>, the dogged reporter and biographer Jeff Pearlman draws on more than four hundred interviews to unearth all the salty, untold stories of one of the craziest sports entities to have ever captivated America. From 1980s drug excess to airplane brawls and player-coach punch outs, to backroom business deals, to some of the most enthralling and revolutionary football ever seen, Pearlman transports readers back in time to this crazy, boozy, audacious, unforgettable era of the game. He shows how fortunes were made and lost on the backs of professional athletes and also how, thirty years ago, Trump was a scoundrel and a spoiler.<br> &nbsp;<br> For fans of Terry Pluto&#x2019;s <i>Loose Balls</i> or Jim Bouton&#x2019;s <i>Ball Four</i> and of course Pearlman&#x2019;s own stranger-than-fiction narratives, <i>Football for a Buck</i> is sports as high entertainment&#x2014;and a cautionary tale of the dangers of ego and excess.</p><p>JEFF PEARLMAN is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of eight books, including <i>Football for a Buck,</i><i>The Bad Guys Won!</i>, <i>Boys Will Be Boys</i>, <i>Showtime</i>, <i>Sweetness </i>and <i>Gunslinger</i>.

While other companies can improve productivity through the use of new technologies or better systems, these approaches are not available in the arts. Hamlet requires the same number of performers today as it did in Shakespeare&#x2019;s time. The New York Philharmonic requires the same number of musicians now as it did when Tchaikovsky conducted it over one hundred years ago. Costs go up, but the size of theaters and the price resistance of patrons limit what can be earned from ticket sales. Therefore, the performing arts industry faces a severe gap between earnings and expenses. Typical approaches to closing the gap&#x2015;raising ticket prices or cutting artistic or marketing expenses&#x2015;don&#x2019;t work. What, then, does it take to create and maintain a healthy arts organization? Michael M. Kaiser has revived four major arts organizations: the Kansas City Ballet, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, American Ballet Theatre, and London&#x2019;s Royal Opera House. In The Art of the Turnaround he shares with readers his ten basic rules for bringing financially distressed arts organizations back to life and keeping them strong. These rules cover the requirements for successful leadership, the pitfalls of cost cutting, the necessity of extending the programming calendar, the centrality of effective marketing and fund raising, and the importance of focusing on the present with a positive public message. In chapters organized chronologically, Kaiser brings his ten rules vividly to life in discussions of the four arts organizations he is credited with saving. The book concludes with a chapter on his experiences at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, an arts organization that needed an artistic turnaround when he became the president in 2001 and that today exemplifies in practice many of the ten rules he discusses throughout his book.</p><p>MICHAEL M. KAISER is President of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Dubbed &#x201c;the turnaround king&#x201d; for his work at numerous institutions, Kaiser has earned international renown for his expertise in arts management. A Cultural Ambassador for the U.S. State Department, he advises performing arts organizations around the world, working with arts leaders in Mexico, Pakistan, China, Latin America, and the Arab nations. He has created an online education forum for arts administrators (www.artsmanager.org) where professionals and students in the field can share experiences, seek employment, and post opportunities.&#x201c;Michael Kaiser has a unique combination of artistic vision and executive talent that makes him one of the most capable leaders in the performing arts. This book tells the story of his impressive leadership. As my brother said in 1960, "The New Frontier for which I campaign in public life can also be a New Frontier for American art," and he'd be very proud of all that Michael Kaiser has accomplished." (Senator Edward M. Kennedy)<br><br>&#x201c;There can be no one who has had the experience&#x2014;the expertise&#x2014;of Michael Kaiser in taking world class performing arts companies and reinventing them for the 21st century. This is a goldmine.&#x201d; (Harold Prince)</p><h2>Invisible in Austin: Life and Labor in an American City</h2><p><p>Austin, Texas, is renowned as a high-tech, fast-growing city for the young and creative, a cool place to live, and the scene of internationally famous events such as SXSW and Formula 1. But as in many American cities, poverty and penury are booming along with wealth and material abundance in contemporary Austin. Rich and poor residents lead increasingly separate lives as growing socioeconomic inequality underscores residential, class, racial, and ethnic segregation.</p><p>In <i>Invisible in Austin</i>, the award-winning sociologist Javier Auyero and a team of graduate students explore the lives of those working at the bottom of the social order: house cleaners, office-machine repairers, cab drivers, restaurant cooks and dishwashers, exotic dancers, musicians, and roofers, among others. Recounting their subjects&#x2019; life stories with empathy and sociological insight, the authors show us how these lives are driven by a complex mix of individual and social forces. These poignant stories compel us to see how poor people who provide indispensable services for all city residents struggle daily with substandard housing, inadequate public services and schools, and environmental risks. Timely and essential reading, <i>Invisible in Austin</i> makes visible the growing gap between rich and poor that is reconfiguring the cityscape of one of America&#x2019;s most dynamic places, as low-wage workers are forced to the social and symbolic margins.</p></p><p>Javier Auyero is the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Professor in Latin American Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, where he directs the Urban Ethnography Lab. He is the author of five previous books, including the award-winning Flammable: Environmental Suffering in an Argentine Shantytown (with D�bora Swistun)."A captivating study of urban life for the disadvantaged. Poignant portraits of inequality and social exclusion are provided through the eyes of the dispossessed, portraits of survival in a brutal social environment. And Javier Auyero and his colleagues expertly illuminate the conditions that foster such economic instability and social insecurity. This unique book is a must-read for individuals and policy makers seeking a deeper understanding of the growing inequality in urban America." (William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University)<br><br>"Who does the hard work that keeps groovy Austin going, and what does it feel like? These multidimensional life stories show us that it&#x2019;s a diverse group, but almost everyone has come from elsewhere to chase the Austin Dream, with its glimmers of postindustrial pleasure and promise. From the chicken-processing plant to the strip club, from the delight of intoxication and the simulation of aspirational class ascendency in the glamour zone of glitzy hotels, to the mundane daily routines and bodily brutality of addiction, accidents and injuries, it&#x2019;s a hard fall and a revolving door of disappointments. Kudos to Javier Auyero and the talented group at the UT Austin sociology ethnography lab for bringing back from margin to center the life story method and workers&#x2019; everyday struggles and for keeping alive the promise of the sociological imagination."

Distance is not measured as the crow flies, but as a taxicab travels the "grid" of the city street, from block to block, vertically and horizontally, until the destination is reached. Because of this non-Euclidean method of measuring distance, some familiar geometric figures are transmitted: for example, circles become squares.<br>However, taxicab geometry has important practical applications. As Professor Krause points out, "While Euclidean geometry appears to be a good model of the 'natural' world, taxicab geometry is a better model of the artificial urban world that man has built."<br>As a result, the book is replete with practical applications of this non-Euclidean system to urban geometry and urban planning &#x2014; from deciding the optimum location for a factory or a phone booth, to determining the most efficient routes for a mass transit system.<br>The underlying emphasis throughout this unique, challenging textbook is on how mathematicians think, and how they apply an apparently theoretical system to the solution of real-world problems.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Thinking About Biology: An Introductory Lab Manual (What&#39;s New in Biology)</h2><p><p> <i>For one-semester, non-majors introductory biology laboratory courses </i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b> <i>Thinking About Biology: An Introductory Lab Manual</i> </b> offers an extensively class-tested approach to the introductory biology laboratory course.

Major architectural innovations were made during this time including the medieval castle, the church spire, and the monastic cloister. By avoiding the traditional emphasis on chronological development, Roger Stalley provides a radically new approach to the subject, exploring issues and themes rather than sequences and dates. In addition to analysing the language of the Romanesque, the book examines the engineering achievements of the builders, focusing on how the great monuments of the age were designed and constructed. Ranging from Gotland to Apulia, Stalley explores the richness and variety of European architecture in terms of the social and religious aspirations of the time. Symbolic meanings associated with architecture are also thoroughly investigated. Written with style and humour, the lively text includes many quotations from ancient sources, providing fascinating insight into the way that medieval buildings were created, and in the process enlivening study of this period.<br></p><p><br><strong>Roger Stalley</strong> is Professor of the History of Art at Trinity College, Dublin. His previous books include <em>Architecture and Sculpture in Ireland 1150-1350</em> (1971), <em>The Cistercian Monasteries of Ireland</em> (1987), <em>Irish High Crosses</em> (1991), and <em>Ireland and Europe in the Middle Ages</em> (1993). He has published over fifty articles on various aspects of medieval sculpture and architecture. He is a member of the Royal Irish Academy and an Honorary member of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland.<br>Medieval architecture brings to mind Gothic cathedrals and fortified castles. But those styles were developed from earlier traditions, as detailed by Stalley (history of art, Trinity Coll., Dublin). Covering the period 313-1200 C.E., Stalley discusses the influence of early Christianity prior to the emergence of the Gothic style. He examines stylistic periods as well as the elements of engineering and construction, the cooperative efforts of builder and patron, and the broad categories of secular and church structures. Photographs of buildings, diagrams, and period art tie in well with the text. Though the focus is specialized, Stalley's book is inviting to both students and general readers. This fine addition to Oxford's series, neatly written and presented, is recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>-Karen Ellis, Nicholson Memorial Lib.

D&#x2019;Souza pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months in a state-run confinement center. &nbsp;There he lived among hardened criminals&#x2014;drug dealers, thieves, gangbangers, rapists, and murderers. Now the bestselling author explains how this experience not only changed his life, but fundamentally transformed his view of his adopted country.</p><p>Previously, D&#x2019;Souza had seen America through the eyes of a grateful immigrant who became successful by applying and defending conservative principles. Again and again, D&#x2019;Souza made the case that America is an exceptional nation, fundamentally fair and just. In book after book, he argued against liberalism as though it were a genuine movement of ideas capable of being engaged and refuted.</p><p>But his prolonged exposure to the criminal underclass provided an eye-opening education in American realities. In the view of hardened criminals, D&#x2019;Souza learned, America is anything but fair and just. Instead, it is a jungle in which various armed gangs face off against one another, with the biggest and most powerful gangs inhabiting the federal government. As for American liberalism, it is not a movement of ideas at all but a series of scams and cons aimed at nothing less than stealing the entire wealth of the nation, built up over more than two centuries: the total value of the homes, the lifelong savings of the people, the assets of every industry, and all the funds allocated to health and education and every other service, both public and private. &#x201c;The thieves I am speaking about want all of it.&#x201d;</p><p>And who are the leading figures in this historically ambitious scam that has turned the federal government into a vast and unprecedented shakedown scheme? Why, none other than Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton &#x2013; the current leaders of the Democratic Party.

A 1996 Caldecott Honor book, this sophisticated, wordless alphabet book is sure to appeal to young and old alike.</p><p><b>Stephen T. Johnson</b> is a highly versatile American artist whose art spans a broad range of concepts, contexts and mediums including painting, collage, drawing, sculpture and installations and can be seen in museum and gallery exhibitions, public art commissions, and through his original award-winning children&#x2019;s books.&nbsp;<br><br>Much of Johnson&#x2019;s work is characterized by an interest in the alphabet and language, which began with his book&nbsp;<i>Alphabet City</i>, a Caldecott Honor and&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Best Illustrated Book of the Year.&nbsp; His most recent engagement with the alphabet is his ongoing series of &#x201c;literal abstractions&#x201d; which are the subject of his book&nbsp;<i>A is for Art: An Abstract Alphabet</i>, also a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Best Illustrated Book of the Year, and featured in several solo museum and gallery exhibitions.Grade 1 Up?Beginning with the A formed by a construction site's sawhorse and ending with the Z found in the angle of a fire escape, Johnson draws viewers' eyes to tiny details within everyday objects to find letters. In this wordless tour of sights from Times Square to the Brooklyn Bridge, he invites young and old alike to take a new look at familiar surroundings, discovering the alphabet without ever looking in a book or reading from a sign. Conceived in the tradition of Ann Jonas's work, especially The Thirteenth Clue (Greenwillow, 1992), Johnson's pastel, watercolor, gouache, and charcoal paintings are much more realistic than his illustrations for The Samurai's Daughter (Dial, 1992); in fact, they are almost photographic in appearance. Some of the images are both clever and incredibly clear, e.g., the E found in the sideways view of a traffic light. Others, such as the C in the rose window of a Gothic church, are more obscure. Nevertheless, all of the paintings are beautifully executed and exhibit a true sense of artistic vision. While parents or teachers might assume from the title that this is a traditional alphabet book, they should be encouraged to look at it as an art book. It's sure to inspire older children to venture out on their own walks to discover the alphabet in the familiar objects of their own hometowns.?Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arrow&#39;s Flight (The Heralds of Valdemar, Book 2)</h2><p><b>Follows the adventures of Talia as she travels the land as a Herald of Valdemar in the second book in the classic epic fantasy Arrows trilogy</b><br><br>Talia could scarcely believe that she had finally earned the rank of full Herald.

For now Talia must ride forth to patrol the kingdom of Valdemar, dispending Herald's justice throughout the land.<br> &nbsp;<br> But in this realm beset by dangerous unrest, enforcing her rulings would require all the courage and skill Talia could command&#x2014;for if she misused her own special powers, both she and Valdemar would pay the price!</p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b> is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling Heralds Of Valdemar series.

She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.<b>One</b><p>Thwack!</p><p>The flat of Alberich&#x2019;s practice-blade cracked against Talia&#x2019;s ill-guarded side. She hadn&#x2019;t seen the blow coming, she truly hadn&#x2019;t. That had hurt, and she would lay money on having a bruise despite the padded jerkin that had absorbed most of the blow. The practice blades may have only been wood, but Alberich tended to wield them all the harder for that.</p><p>&#x201c;Faugh!&#x201d; he spat in disgust, and came at her again before she had recovered from the last blow. This time he connected with her knife-arm, right at the elbow. She yelped, the arm went numb, and she lost her blade entirely.</p><p>The hawklike eyes glared at her with no trace of pity, and the scar-seamed face was a demonic mask as he passed judgment on her performance.</p><p>He was at least in his mid-forties, if not older, but he hadn&#x2019;t lost a fraction of his edge or agility in the five years Talia had known him. She was panting with exertion&#x2014;he might as well have been taking a leisurely stroll. His well-worn, dark leathers (he was the only working Herald in Talia&#x2019;s experience who never wore Whites) showed not so much as a tiny sweat stain. The afternoon sun pouring down on all of them had made him look as thin and insubstantial as a shadow. And he had been just as hard to catch.</p><p>&#x201c;A pity it is that Skif is not here to see you. Die of laughter he surely would!&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;Eighteen you are&#x2014;one would think you eight. Slow, clumsy, and stupid! Paugh! Had I been a real assassin&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would have died of fright before you touched me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now it is jokes! This is a battle-practice&#x2014;not a comedy. If I wish amusement, I shall find a jester. Once again&#x2014;and correctly, this time.&#x201d;</p><p>Once she was ready to drop with exhaustion, he turned his attention to Elspeth. Now that both of them deserved special tutelage he had changed the hour of their lessons to one shared by no one else, so that he could give his full devotion to the Queen&#x2019;s Own and Heir-presumptive. Rather than being held on the training grounds outside, the two had their drills in the salle. This was a barn-like building with a sanded wooden floor, lined with mirrors, with high clerestory windows to admit the maximum amount of light. Lessons were always held here during inclement weather, but it was too small for mass practices and classes for the combined Heraldic-Bardic-Healer&#x2019;s Collegium students. Only those &#x201c;privileged&#x201d; to receive private lessons with Alberich took those lessons habitually in the salle.</p><p>Now that his attention was off her, Talia found her thoughts drifting back to her surprise of this afternoon.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Talia tugged and wriggled impatiently until she had succeeded in getting the supple, soft, white leather tunic over her head. Pulling it into place over the white raime shirt and leather breeches, she finally turned to admire the effect in the polished metal mirror in front of her.</p><p>&#x201c;Havens!&#x201d; she laughed, not a little surprised, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t the Grays ever look like this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; a harsh voice drawled from the next room, &#x201c;You youngsters would have your minds on anything but your studies if they did!&#x201d;</p><p>Talia laughed, turned back to the mirror, and preened. Today was the anniversary of her first class at Herald&#x2019;s Collegium&#x2014;a fact that she&#x2019;d forgotten until Keren and Sherrill (senior Heralds both, and instructors at the Collegium as well as Talia&#x2019;s longtime friends) arrived at her room with their arms full of white uniforms and wearing broad grins.</p><p>For the Heraldic Circle had considered&#x2014;for less than five minutes, all told&#x2014;had voted&#x2014;and had passed Talia into full Herald status with the rest of her year-mates&#x2014;no surprise to anyone in the Collegium, though by tradition the trainees were not to know when they were to be evaluated until the evaluation had already been made and they had passed.</p><p>Keren and Sherrill had claimed the right to give her the good news.</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t even give her a chance to think, either&#x2014;just appeared at her door, swept her up one on either side, and herded her down the long, dark wood-paneled hall of the Collegium dormitory, down the stairs to the first floor, and out the double doors at the end.</p><p>From there they had taken her off to the Seneschal&#x2019;s office to claim her new quarters. Now she stood in the bedroom of the suite she&#x2019;d chosen, marveling at her reflection.</p><p>&#x201c;I look like a real grownup for a change!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is the general idea,&#x201d; Sherrill laughed richly.</p><p>She cocked her head to one side, regarding the tiny, slender figure in the mirror. Her unruly red-brown curls were as tousled as ever, but somehow gave an impression now of being tumbled the way they were on purpose. The huge, deep-brown eyes that had been utterly guileless seemed somehow wiser; the heart-shaped face no longer so childlike. And all that change wrought by the magic of a new uniform!</p><p>&#x201c;Talia, your head is going to swell like a spongetoad in rainy season if you&#x2019;re not careful.&#x201d; Keren interrupted her train of thought a second time. By craning her neck to peer around the doorframe Talia could see the riding instructor grinning sardonically from where she was sprawled on the wooden-backed, red-cushioned couch in the other room.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know what the Book of the One says?&#x201d; Sherrill added piously over her mate&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;&#x2018;Great pride shall earn equal humiliation.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Talia left her bedroom to join them. They were lounging comfortably in her sparsely-furnished outer room, sharing the lone couch.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re both going to claim that you never spent so much as a minute in front of the mirror when you first got your Whites,&#x201d; Talia taunted, strolling toward them with her hands clasped behind her back.</p><p>&#x201c;Who? Me?&#x201d; Sherrill replied in artificial innocence, lifting an airy hand and batting thick black lashes over wide hazel eyes. &#x201c;And feed my vanity? W-e-l-l, maybe a little.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I happen to know for a fact that you spent half the day there. I&#x2019;m told you were trying every hairstyle you could twist that black mane of yours into, seeing which one went best with the new outfits,&#x201d; Keren countered dryly, running her fingers through her own close-cropped, graying brown hair.</p><p>Sherrill just grinned and crossed her legs elegantly, leaning back into the cushions. &#x201c;Since I can&#x2019;t claim equal knowledge of what you did on that august occasion, that&#x2019;s hardly a fair blow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I did my share of mirror-gazing,&#x201d; Keren admitted with mock reluctance. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re as scrawny as a sapling and flat as a boy, it&#x2019;s rather astonishing to see yourself in something that actually flatters you. I swear I don&#x2019;t know how they do it&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the same pattern for everybody, and not that dissimilar from the Student Grays&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Lord, the difference!&#x201d; Sherri concluded for her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anybody who doesn&#x2019;t look fantastic in their Whites. Even Dirk manages to look presentable. Rumpled, but presentable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what do you think of me?&#x201d; Talia asked, turning on her toes in front of them, and grinning impishly into Keren&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;What do I think? That you look fabulous, you young demon. Keep fishing for compliments, though, and I&#x2019;ll likely dump you in the horse trough. Have they told you anything about your internship?&#x201d;</p><p>Talia shook her head, and clasped her hands behind her again. &#x201c;No. All they said was that the Herald they want to pair me with is in the field, and they won&#x2019;t tell me who it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s pretty much to be expected. They don&#x2019;t want you to have time to think of things to impress him with,&#x201d; Sherrill replied. Suddenly her eyes sparkled with mischief. &#x201c;Oh, but I can think of one prospect that would give Nerrissa a litter of kittens!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Talia asked, head to one side.</p><p>&#x201c;Kris and Dirk are due back in the next few weeks, and Dirk got the last greenie&#x2014;as you should know, since it was Skif&#x2014;so it&#x2019;s Kris&#x2019; turn next! Nessa would die!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sherri, it&#x2019;s only my internship assignment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A year and a half Sector-riding, most of it spent alone together, and you say it&#x2019;s only an assignment? Talia, you must have ice water for blood! Do you have any notion of the number of hours Nessa&#x2014;and half the females of the Circle, for that matter&#x2014;spend on their knees praying for an assignment like that? Are you sure you don&#x2019;t have leanings our way?&#x201d;</p><p>Talia chuckled, and wrinkled her nose at them. &#x201c;Quite sure, darlings. Just what is Kris&#x2019; attraction for Nessa, anyway? She&#x2019;s got most of the males of the Circle panting at her heels as it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The lure of the unattainable, or so I would surmise,&#x201d; Keren supplied, lids half-closed lazy with only a glint of brown iris showing. &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t taken a vow of chastity, but he&#x2019;s so circumspect about his dalliances you&#x2019;d never know it. It drives Nessa wild, and the harder she chases, the faster he runs. She&#x2019;s as caught up now by the chase as by the face.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she can chase him all she wants. I am not at all impressed by Kris&#x2019; handsome face,&#x201d; Talia replied firmly.</p><p>&#x201c;Or the gorgeous body&#x2014;?&#x201d; interjected Sherrill.</p><p>&#x201c;Or the gorgeous body. Nessa can have all the gorgeous bodies in the Circle, for all I care. Holderkin men are handsome specimens, and I can do without them&#x2014;my father could have given Kris stiff competition in his younger days, and I&#x2019;ve told you what kind of a petty tyrant he was. And my late-but-not-lamented brother Justus was actually handsomer, if you favor blonds, and he was the foulest person I&#x2019;ve ever known. I&#x2019;d rather have a good heart and plain packaging.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but Kris is a Herald&#x2014;&#x201d; Sherrill pointed out, tapping one long finger on her knee for emphasis. &#x201c;That guarantees the good heart without having to settle for a homely exterior. No handsome, smiling bastards in our ranks&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sherri, this is all sheer speculation. Until I find out who I&#x2019;m interning with, I refuse to worry about the subject,&#x201d; Talia replied firmly.</p><p>&#x201c;You are no fun at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never said I was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm. Dirk&#x2019;s interning that scalawag Skif&#x2014;&#x201d; Keren said thoughtfully. &#x201c;You and Skif were very thick there for a while. In fact, as I recall, you and he had a rumor or two floating about your heads. Is that why you aren&#x2019;t interested in Dirk&#x2019;s partner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Talia smiled enigmatically. The fact that their &#x201c;romance&#x201d; had been entirely without any result was Skif&#x2019;s secret&#x2014;and hers. The streak of ill-luck and accident that had plagued their meetings had not had any effect on their friendship: except that they had never managed to be more than just that&#x2014;friends. Oddly enough, though, except for a brief period of anxiety when word had come that Skif had been hurt during his first three months in the field, Talia had thought less of Skif, and more of his counselor. To her own amazement&#x2014;and for no reason, logical or fanciful, that she could think of&#x2014;when her thoughts strayed in the direction of the former thief and his internship assignment, it was in Dirk&#x2019;s direction that they tended to wander. This was annoying; she&#x2019;d met the man all of three times in her life, and had never been in his company for more than an hour or two at most. Yet, that homely face and those wonderful blue eyes kept lingering stubbornly in her thoughts. It did not make sense.</p><p>She shook her head to free it of those fanciful images. She had little enough time, and had none to spare in daydreams.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, this little wardrobe change of yours ought to surprise little Elspeth,&#x201d; Sherrill said, changing the subject.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lady Bright&#x2014;&#x201d; Talia sat down with a thump on one of her cushions, joy extinguished. It almost seemed to her at that moment that the bright sun-rays pouring through her windows had dimmed. &#x201c;Poor Elspeth&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something up?&#x201d; Keren asked, one eyebrow rising.</p><p>&#x201c;Just the usual.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s usual? You know I don&#x2019;t get around the Court.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Intrigue rising beyond gossip. She&#x2019;s almost fourteen and still not Chosen; there&#x2019;s muttering in the Court that she&#x2019;s still the Brat under the skin and she&#x2019;ll never be Chosen. In Council meetings one or more of the Councilors is usually trying to pressure Selenay into naming an Heir&#x2014;&#x2018;pro tem,&#x2019; as they put it&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Sherrill asked in alarm, sitting straight up. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s stirring up the water?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know I can&#x2019;t tell you that! Anyway it isn&#x2019;t just those particular Councilors; it&#x2019;s more than half of the Court. Elspeth doesn&#x2019;t say much, but it&#x2019;s got her very depressed, poor baby. Their timing couldn&#x2019;t be worse. She&#x2019;s already moody enough with the normal adolescent woes, and this has got her in near-tears on a regular basis. When I&#x2019;m not getting my shoulder soggy, I keep finding her at Companion&#x2019;s Field whenever she&#x2019;s free, sort of lurking&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hoping any minute to be Chosen. Gods, no wonder she&#x2019;s wearing a long face whenever I see her. What&#x2019;s Rolan got to say about this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be damned if I know!&#x201d; Talia gifted Keren with a look of exasperation. &#x201c;You know he doesn&#x2019;t Mindspeak me in words.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Keren winced, &#x201c;I keep forgetting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s worried, but it could be as much over the machinations and power-maneuverings at Court as anything else. The current candidates are Jeri, Kemoc, and your oh-so-lovely Kris.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful people in and of themselves,&#x201d; Keren observed, &#x201c;But with some not-so-wonderful relatives lurking in the family trees. One would think Kris&#x2019; uncle Lord Orthallen would have his hands full enough as chief Councilor without wanting to be the Heir&#x2019;s uncle&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That man will never have enough power to satisfy him,&#x201d; Talia snapped bitterly.</p><p>Keren raised an eyebrow at the outburst, and continued. &#x201c;Kemoc&#x2019;s horde of lazy cousins would swarm the Court, looking for sinecures&#x2014;and Kemoc&#x2019;s such a soft touch he&#x2019;d try to manage it. And Jeri&#x2014;Lady Bright! Her mother!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d have a battle royal every day between Jeri and Lady Indra over how Jeri&#x2019;s Council votes should go. I wish her husband would lock her away. Or buy a gag for her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amen. Pity none of them come without baggage. Not my idea of a fun situation. And poor catling caught in the middle.&#x201d;</p><p>Talia sighed in agreement. &#x201c;Speaking of no fun, I&#x2019;d better scramble. Alberich informed me in no uncertain terms that my new status does not exempt me from his special lessons. I have the sinking feeling that he intends to slap my inflated pride down to pre-student levels, and probably with the flat of his blade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I watch?&#x201d; Keren asked wickedly.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not? Elspeth&#x2019;s always there, and there&#x2019;s nothing like being worse at something than a thirteen-year-old girl to really deflate your opinions of yourself. Well, that ought to reinflate her self-esteem a bit. Ah, me, it&#x2019;s a pity to have to get these lovely new clothes all over dirt and sweat&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>As they descended the cool darkness of the spiraling staircase, Keren and Sherrill in the lead with their arms casually linked, Talia reflected that bringing them together was probably the best thing she&#x2019;d ever done. The bond between them was easily as strong as the one Keren had shared with Ylsa&#x2014;and had Ylsa lived, they might very well have formed one of the relatively rare, permanent threesomes. There was no doubt that they were very good for each other. Poor Ylsa . . .</p><p>Talia&#x2019;s chosen living quarters were at the very top of her tower at the end of the Herald&#x2019;s wing. The suites in the four towers were seldom used&#x2014;probably because they were more than a bit inconvenient.

It is believed that these statues represented specific teachings and spiritual forms in order to maintain spiritual connection. Just like Qigong, Tai Chi, Yoga, &amp; Vedic Mudras; the Egyptian system utilizes the sacred movements, postures and geometry of the body to go in harmonic resonance with different universal energies. These energies are then used for specific purposes of ceremony, wellness, enlightenment, and personal growth. For thousands of years postures have been utilized to energetically cleanse, balance, and align our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies with the natural life giving forces of the universe.</p><p>Jason Quitt has been studying various modalities and spiritual practices with teachers from around the world. He graduated from the Institute of Energy Wellness in 2005 and began working with ancient healing techniques and became a student of Algonquin Shamanism. From his out of body experiences Jason has received information on numerous energetic systems of healing and spiritual development. He published these methods in his book &#x201c;Egyptian Postures of Power - Ancient Qigong System&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Yosef Codes - Sacred Geometry Mandalas of Meditation&#x201d;.</p><h2>God Calling: A Devotional Diary</h2><p>Two women--the listeners--gathered together in a prayerful search for guidance and succor, listening for the Word of God.

These trips mystify Amos; just once he'd like to know where his masters go. He gets his chance when he accidently hits a certain spot on the couch and it roars to life like a small upholstered car. Forward, reversethis couch can moveand so, of course, can Amos. He regularly trails the Bobsons, always returning home before they do.

Drawn from primary sources and contemporary accounts, this new narrative allows readers to come to their own conclusions about this legendary vessel.</p></li></p><p>The familiar story of the RMS <i>Titanic</i>--from her tragic 10-second encounter with an iceberg to her descent to the bottom of the ocean some three hours later, taking with her more than 1,500 lives--still looms large in the popular imagination. Daniel Butler, a researcher and archivist, worked on this book for 30 years, intensively compiling facts not only about the event, but also about the characters who played an important role, from the actions of Captain Smith and his crew to the inescapable fate of the third-class passengers. He also offers the startling revelation of a nearby ship which ignored the <i>Titanic</i>'s distress call because the shipmates were afraid to awaken their captain.<p> <i>Unsinkable</i> explores every facet of the <i>Titanic</i>'s history, from its conception to a modern-day researcher's attempts to salvage the ship. The author presents a contemporary view of the crew and the passengers aboard, creating a better understanding of the time and the social psyche that played a role in the disaster. Also of note is Butler's enlistment of a clinical psychologist to analyze Captain Smith's mental state as the drama unfolded before him. Butler's passionate yet balanced narrative permits readers to conclude for themselves who or what was ultimately responsible for sinking the unsinkable ship.</p>No other ship in history has attracted so much attention, stirred up such powerful emotion, or accumulated as many legends and myths as Titanic. "Unsinkable" is a fresh look at this incredible story, one that centers on the people who built the ship, crewed her, and sailed on her. It follows the great ship as she grows on the ways at Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast, sails from Southampton toward her unexpected rendezvous with an iceberg, then slowly sinks into the North Atlantic, forever shattering the optimistic complacency of her era. The story doesn't end there, however, for the tale continues through the high drama of the U.S. Senate investigation and the British Board of Trade inquiry, then introduces the "mystery ship" Californian, whose officers watched Titanic sink and did nothing for fear of being subjected to their sleeping captain's wrath. The narrative then carries on with the recovery of many of Titanic's dead and their interment at Halifax, Nova Scotia, through the discovery of the wreck in 1985, and finally to the abortive 1996 expedition to raise a section of her rusted hull.</p><h2>D�rer</h2><p><strong>Germany's greatest Renaissance artist</strong> &nbsp; Though he is most famous for his engravings, Albrecht D�rer (1471-1528) was also a master painter and draftsman whose work exemplifies the spirit of German art. D�rer&#x2019;s importance in the German High Renaissance was such that he can be considered to embody the movement entirely. His visits to Italy (where he studied most notably with Giovanni Bellini) had a profound effect on his artistic development and enabled him to combine both German and Italian influences in his work. In his later life, D�rer&#x2019;s passion for knowledge and progress led him to research and write on the subjects of art theory and mathematics, making him not only the greatest Northern European artist of his time, but also one of its leading thinkers. This overview of D�rer&#x2019;s entire oeuvre&#x2014;covering his oil, tempera, and watercolor paintings, copper and wood engravings, and his drawings and sketches&#x2014;is the perfect introduction to his work. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Norbert Wolf graduated in art history, linguistics and medieval studies at the universities of Regensburg and Munich, and earned his PhD in 1983.

More than four and a half million copies of <i>Where the Sidewalk Ends</i> have been sold, making it the bestselling children's poetry book ever. With this and his other poetry collections (<i>A Light in the Attic</i> and <i>Falling Up</i>), Silverstein reveals his genius for reaching kids with silly words and simple pen-and-ink drawings. What child can resist a poem called "Dancing Pants" or "The Dirtiest Man in the World"? Each of the 130 poems is funny in a different way, or touching ... or both. Some approach naughtiness or are a bit disgusting to squeamish grown-ups, but that's exactly what kids like best about Silverstein's work.

Margaret Atwood currently lives in Toronto with writer Graeme Gibson.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;With her graphic novel debut, acclaimed author Atwood tells the story of Strig, an ordinary man who mutates into a strange owl/cat/human hybrid because of a secret formula. Featuring familiar tropes&#x2014;an unlikely superhero and an evil villain who laughs maniacally as he plans to take over the world&#x2014;the tale is reminiscent of classic superhero comics. Added to the mix are Cate, Strig's coworker and love interest, and an entire underground community of hybrid creatures. The artwork is colorful, vibrant, and filled with action. Atwood's introduction explains how and why this book was created, touching on her childhood interest in comics and her adult pursuit of bird conservation. Overall, this is a well-intentioned book that sometimes feels too purposeful. There are pieces of statistical information and website links about cats scattered throughout. Often, these facts feel preachy and overly educational (for instance, a reminder of "The Importance of Fixing Your Cat"), and the placement is at times jarring, breaking up the narrative flow. VERDICT An attractive but sometimes disjointed offering; for larger collections with superhero fans seeking additional materials.&#x2014;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</p><h2>To Fly Again: Surviving the Tailspins of Life</h2><p>The world learned the horrendous details of Martin and Gracia Burnham's yearlong captivity in Gracia's best-selling, Gold Medallion Award-winning book, <i>In the Presence of My Enemies.</i> In this follow-up, Gracia reflects on the lessons and spiritual truths she learned in the jungle and how they apply to anyone's life. Twenty-one brief, theme-based chapters squarely address the challenges each of us face as we pass through difficult times to take to the skies again. This book offers no pat answers or easy solutions, just the battle-tested wisdom of a woman who lived her greatest nightmare and came through it more convinced of God's grace than ever before.</p><p>Is it possible to soar&#x2014;not just survive&#x2014;after life has knocked you down? <p> Gracia Burnham understands those feelings. She and her husband, Martin, spent a horrific year as hostages among the Abu Sayyaf terrorists in the Philippines. She was rescued after a gun battle that killed her husband. But when she returned to the United States, her life was filled with uncertainty. </p> <p> Using examples from the Burnhams&#x2019; year in the jungle, as well as her experiences since returning home, Gracia writes about the confusion, fear, anger, anxiety, and loss of control experienced by all people in crisis. She also relates how God longs to pour his grace into people, raising them to soar above their broken dreams. </p> <p> Read by Audi Award nominee Aimee Lilly</p>Gracia Burnham and her husband were kidnapped by terrorists in the Philippines, and her husband was killed in a rescue attempt. When her memoir addresses her experiences, it is powerful. However, when she moves to theological concerns, she's less original, often lapsing into judgment and lack of reflection. Aimee Lilly's delivery is rich and varied. Her shifting tones match the ups and downs of Burnham's narrative, and she handles the few foreign terms with ease. Lilly is in every way professional. The only weakness is that this is such a personal and dramatic story it would be nice to have more raw emotion to match it. G.T.B. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The True History of Chocolate</h2><p>It seems strange to think that even the humble chocolate bar has a long and interesting history. This history reaches far back to the earliest civilisation in the Americas, and it was the Olmecs not the Aztecs who can be rightly named as the inventors of chocolate. Told with flair and wit, this history of cacoa looks at its ancient Mexican roots, questioning how it became the food of the gods, its ritual significance, and how it was used as a currency in trade among the Olmec. Piecing together a range of archaeological, documentary and pictorial evidence, Sophie and Michael Coe discuss the Theobrama cacoa tree, the chemical properties of cacao and its early domestication and use. The story of chocolate continues under the Aztecs and their first encounters with the Europeans. The authors trace the transformation and renaming of cacao as it made its way to the chocoholics of Europe - `the white-skinned perfumed, bewigged, overdressed royalty and nobility&#39;. Finally, Coe and Coe discuss its years of competititon with tea and coffee as the preferred hot beverage, its links with the Church, and its surrender to the industrialisation of the 19th century which withdrew the mystique of this luscious mouth-watering treat and turned it into an everyday, mass-produced, highly calorific product.</p><p>The Coes, both anthropologists with a culinary bent, delve deeply into the history of their mouth-watering subject. The material on ancient cultures is particularly fascinating--did you know that the Maya used unsweetened liquid chocolate as currency? And in a chapter called &#34;Chocolate for the Masses,&#34; they detail the modernization of chocolate manufacture, which has allowed more than 25 million Hershey&#39;s Kisses to roll off the conveyor belt each day.Sophie D. Coe was an anthropologist and food historian. Michael D. Coe is Professor Emeritus of Archaeology and Curator Emeritus in the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, and is the author of the bestselling Breaking the Maya Code, also published by Thames &amp; Hudson.</p><h2>Robert B.

The wide night sky pushed down hard on the four weary horsemen, appraising them, like a powerful and intolerant observer.</i></p><p><i>With their tilted brims and slouching shoulders, the mounted men rode single file and without word, as their horses carried them toward their destination. They were all fairly young. One was a hefty fellow with a large gut; the second was gangly with a narrow face and shoulders; the third was also skinny but was dark-skinned, maybe a half-breed; and the fourth was small and wiry.</i></p><p><i>Hard to know what the hell these night riders were thinking. What was going on in their heads? They would have had to feel the overhead pressure, the challenging and unforgiving weight. The stars loomed close enough to reach out and touch; a twisted twinkling expanse. The four horsemen rode slowly, deliberately up the eastern rim of the Rio Blanco River.</i></p><p><i>The only sound was the occasional clink of a bit, the footfalls of their horses, and the soft rumble of the white-water river in the canyon far below.</i></p><p><i>The dropping moon provided enough light for them to see their dogged and hell-bent way, and just ahead, where he was supposed to be, they saw the big man waiting for them.</i></p><p><i>They had met him only once before. They knew from the brief encounter he was not someone to cross. Not ever. He was different, above average in every respect. He could smile and show his nice white teeth, but he was menacing and ill-tempered to his very core. There was something even more dangerous about him: it was as if he were from another place in time. One of the riders told the others that the big sonofabitch reminded him of what the warrior Achilles might have been like. He was handsome and rawboned. He had a warrior swagger to him as if he&#x2019;d single-handedly just wiped out an army and was looking forward to his next victim. His movements were swift and specific. He had thick, broad shoulders and his hands and forearms were sinewy with muscle. His neck was wide and corded. He had a full head of shiny, coarse hair and his eyes were deep-set and dark blue.</i></p><p><i>The night riders were also fearful of the two brothers who would accompany them later, but they were in this, all of them. They would not turn back and they could not turn back, not now, not tonight. They were all committed to what they rode out on this night to do.</i></p><p><i>The big Achilles man got to his feet in the buckboard. He stood looking at them as they neared and then jumped down from the wagon as they came to a stop.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re late,&#x201d; he said.</i></p><p><i>He threw back a canvas uncovering the wagon&#x2019;s freight.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;What about the telegraph lines,&#x201d; he asked, before they could defend their belated arrival.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re cut,&#x201d; the dark-skinned man said, as he dismounted.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You see anybody?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We did not,&#x201d; the hefty man said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Anybody see you?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;No, nobody.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; the hefty man replied.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get a move on it.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;How far from here?&#x201d; the small, wiry man said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Quarter-mile,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;From here we go in on foot. Each one hauls a load.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Where we gonna meet &#x2019;em?&#x201d; the hefty man said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Just carry your load and follow me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Got one hour before sunup.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The riders didn&#x2019;t waste any time. They tied their horses under a stand of small sycamores and went about the task at hand.</i></p><p><i>One by one, each of the men removed the supplies from the buckboard and followed the big warrior man, the Achilles man.</i></p><p><i>They walked along a narrow deer path through thickets, high above the river. As they neared their destination, they could hear someone up ahead of them.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Far enough,&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s voice said.</i></p><p><i>The voice was raspy, with a distinct southern drawl.</i></p><p><i>They knew it was one of the brothers, and then they saw them both. The two men stepped out from a cluster of briars near a tree-covered wash that folded off down toward the river some two hundred feet below.</i></p><p><i>The brothers were stout men, with full, bristly beards and tangled, unruly hair. Two of the riders had known the brothers in earlier days and were not any more comfortable with them than they were with the warrior man.</i></p><p><i>Both brothers were intelligent men, but they were mercurial and quick-tempered. They presented themselves as polite and forthright, but a strange, disconnected quality lurked within. They both were quiet and though their eyes were kind, there was a constant callous and mistrusting element about their demeanor.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever turn your back on them,&#x201d; the dark-skinned man said to the others.</i></p><p><i>This night, however, what these men were focused on was the brothers&#x2019; shrewd scheme. They recruited the warrior man and the four riders, and if everything went as planned, they all would make a lot of money. More money than any of them would have made in a lifetime.</i></p><p><i>Before tonight, they had done a mock run of the plan. Each man knew his job. When the taller brother said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; they moved out.</i></p><p><i>It did not take long for them to plant the dynamite.</i></p><p><i>One of the men, the heavyset man, knew everything about how and where it should be placed. He had been the one who showed the others what to do. His extensive knowledge of explosives was the very reason for his recruitment in the first place.</i></p><p><i>Daybreak was upon them and the first rays of sun began to appear as the heavyset man instructed the younger brother how to terminate the last connection.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; the younger brother said.</i></p><p><i>The heavyset man nodded. He started off walking toward the trail that led back to the buckboard. The others were ahead of him and he followed them as he unspooled the wire.</i></p><p><i>After the younger brother made the final connection and was headed back toward the deer path he came face-to-face with Percy O&#x2019;Malley.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Percy said. &#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The brother was startled to see the old man.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Morning, Percy,&#x201d; the brother said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;What are you doing out here so early?&#x201d; Percy said.</i></p><p><i>The brother looked around the old man to see if there was anyone behind him.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you,&#x201d; the brother said, as he walked to the edge.</i></p><p><i>The old man followed him.</i></p><p><i>The brother pointed to the river, two hundred feet below.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; the brother said.</i></p><p><i>When Percy leaned over to look, the brother pulled his long knife from its sheath, cupped his hand around the old man&#x2019;s mouth, and slit his throat. He shoved the man off the side and watched as his body tumbled into the river. If he had stopped to look, he would have seen the body swept up by the current, leaving a murky red trail dispatched behind it.</i></p><p><i>By the time he made it back to where the other men were, the heavyset man had the wires connected on the terminals of the detonator.</i></p><p><i>They had a good vantage point from their location.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Who wants to do the honors?&#x201d; the heavyset man said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; the warrior man said without hesitation.</i></p><p><i>He got down on his knees and the others closed in behind him.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;On three,&#x201d; the warrior man said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;One&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He lowered the plunger handle on the detonator and the men watched the three-hundred-foot iron bridge that crossed over the Rio Blanco River explode in a monstrous blast, earth-quaking and sulfurous as if it came from deep down in hell, delivered by the Evil Red Devil himself.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x2014;1&#x2014;</p><p>Weather.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look good,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Virgil said. &#x201c;It don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Virgil and I were watching a faraway line of darkness coming toward us from the north.</p><p>&#x201c;Got this place shingled just in time,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Virgil glanced up, looking at the underside of the porch overhang we were sitting under.</p><p>&#x201c;Know soon enough if we got any leaks,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Spect we will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This&#x2019;ll be the first sign of weather since we&#x2019;ve been back here in Appaloosa,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Virgil said, looking back to the clouds. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Been warm and dry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Hot, even.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Has,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>Virgil put the heels of his boots on the porch rail and tipped his chair back a little.

Where she learns how to measure stuff out and how long to cook it and what goes with what and so on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I offered,&#x201d; Virgil said. &#x201c;She told me all good chefs cook by the seat of their pants.&#x201d;</p><p>We both thought about that for a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;You got some of that Kentucky?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;Might as well have ourselves a nudge or two,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;No reason not to,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>Virgil removed his boots from the porch railing and lowered the front legs of the chair he&#x2019;d been tilting back in. He got to his feet just as three men on horseback wearing oilcloth slickers rounded Second Street, riding directly toward us at a steady pace. It was Sheriff Sledge Driskill with two of his deputies, Chip Childers and Karl Worley.</p><p>&#x201c;Got some intention,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;They do,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x2014;2&#x2014;</p><p>Might be the end of those temperate times we were talking about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>Sledge and his deputies slowed as they neared and came to a stop just in front of the porch.</p><p>&#x201c;Virgil,&#x201d; Sledge said. &#x201c;Everett.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Afternoon,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Virgil eased up to the porch steps.</p><p>&#x201c;Sledge,&#x201d; Virgil said with a nod. &#x201c;Boys.&#x201d;</p><p>Sledge was a big man with thick black eyebrows and a full dark beard streaked with silver. Karl was a skinny Canadian fella, an ex-cowhand who was never without sheep chaps. Chip was a chubby overgrown kid with a large wad of tobacco crammed in his cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;What brings you here?&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to let y&#x2019;all know,&#x201d; Sledge said, &#x201c;got some business away. And the town will be scarce of us for a bit. Only deputies left on duty will be Skinny Jack and Book. Chastain is sick in bed with a stomach bug.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where you headed,&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re headed up to the bridge camp.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Sledge said, tipping his head to the dark clouds on the northern horizon. &#x201c;Storm&#x2019;s a comin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That it is,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Need to beat it best we can,&#x201d; Sledge said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why the bridge camp?&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;Know Lonnie Carman?&#x201d;</p><p>Virgil shook his head, then looked at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Know who he is,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Little fella with the tattoos, did some time, works at the Boston House?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; Sledge said. &#x201c;He don&#x2019;t work there anymore. He&#x2019;s been working on the bridge crew.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about him?&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Sledge said. &#x201c;His new wife, Winifred, believes something has happened to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Virgil said.</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t return from his bridge shift when he was supposed to,&#x201d; Sledge said.</p><p>Bridge camp was a construction site a day&#x2019;s ride south of Appaloosa. The bridge had been a major undertaking for the territory. It spanned a wide chasm across the Rio Blanco, where rotating crews of workers had been constructing the massive timber-and-steel truss crossing for the better part of two years.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does she think something has happened to him?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Sledge shrugged a bit.</p><p>&#x201c;Says it&#x2019;s unlike him. Says he&#x2019;s punctual. She came to see me yesterday. Said Lonnie was supposed to be back home by now. Said she sent two wires to the way station near the bridge where they correspond bridge business, materials and what have you, but got no response back. I told her, give it a little time, maybe he was just busy bridge building.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been back three times since,&#x201d; Karl said.</p><p>Sledge nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Each time she&#x2019;s been more riled. She put her nose in my face,&#x201d; Sledge said, shaking his head a little, &#x201c;said if I didn&#x2019;t go and find her husband she was gonna come roust the two marshals in town to do the lookin&#x2019; and, well, I don&#x2019;t want that. Having her coming over here pestering y&#x2019;all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She hollered in his face last time,&#x201d; Chip said, then spit a stream of tobacco juice in the dirt. &#x201c;Eyes damn near popped out of her skull.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hollered, hell,&#x201d; Karl said. &#x201c;She screamed like a cut calf.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have the heart to tell her maybe he run off,&#x201d; Sledge said.</p><p>&#x201c;I know I damn sure would,&#x201d; Chip said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t imagine marrying a lady like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell, no,&#x201d; Karl said with a nod in agreement. &#x201c;Me for sure, neither.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No matter,&#x201d; Sledge said. &#x201c;Wanted to spare you two of the misery of her coming over here. We&#x2019;re gonna ride up, see if we can find the poor sonofabitch.&#x201d;</p><p>Virgil nodded some.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be here,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Sledge gave a sharp nod, then backed up his big bay a bit.</p><p>The lawmen turned their horses and rode off south. We watched them as they galloped off and disappeared behind the mercantile at the end of the street.</p><p>&#x201c;Winifred?&#x201d; Virgil said. &#x201c;That the fearsome lady churns butter at the grocer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Virgil nodded a bit, then walked into the house to get the Kentucky whiskey.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x2014;3&#x2014;</p><p>Virgil and I had been working our job as territorial marshals for close to a year before we returned to Appaloosa.

Jane, the eldest daughter, falls in love with Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor who moves into a house nearby with his two sisters and friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy is attracted to the second daugher, Elizabeth, but Elizabeth finds him arrogant and self-centered. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, she refuses. But perhaps there is more to Darcy than meets the eye.&nbsp;<br><br>For over 150 years, Jane Austen's warm, witty account of love, family, and the folly of first impressions has been praised as a must-read book for readers of all ages.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i> <p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p> <p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In a remote Hertfordshire village, far off the good coach roads of George III&#39;s England, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet -- a country squire of no great means and his scatterbrained wife -- must marry off their five vivacious daughters. At the heart of this all-consuming enterprise are the headstrong second daughter Elizabeth and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy, two lovers in whom pride and prejudice must be overcome before love can bring the novel to its magnificent conclusion.</p><h2>Passion by Design: The Art and Times of Tamara De Lempicka</h2><p>The life of the artist and the development of her painting style is traced by her daughter</p><p></p><h2>Hiding in Plain Sight: The Secret Life of Raymond Burr</h2><p>(Applause Books). The complete story of the actor&#39;s career, including his secret gay life. Raymond Burr (1917-1993) was an enigma. A film noir star regularly known for his villainous roles in movies like Rear Window , he delighted millions of viewers each week with the top-rated shows Perry Mason and Ironside , which ran virtually uninterrupted for 20 years. But Burr was leading a secret gay life at a time in Hollywood when such a lifestyle was akin to career suicide. He invented a tragic biography for himself in which he was mythologized as a heartbroken husband and father. There was even an invented affair with a teenage Natalie Wood, 21 years his junior. He fought for truth as Perry Mason and Robert T. Ironside, yet he couldn&#39;t admit his own deception. Burr met his partner, struggling actor Robert Benevides, on the set of Perry Mason , and they remained together for over 35 years until Burr&#39;s death. Together, they built a business empire, traveled the world, and shared their passion for orchids and fine wine keeping the true nature of their relationship a secret from all but their closest friends a secret revealed here for the first time in depth.</p><p>Michael Seth Starr (Northern New Jersey) has covered television at The New York Post for twelve years. He&#39;s written biographies of Peter Sellers, Art Carney, Joey Bishop, and Bobby Darin. He has appeared on the following national television programs to promote his books: The Today Show, The Early Show, Larry King Live, Entertainment Tonight, Extra, and Access Hollywood.Starr's lackluster biography doesn't do justice to the complex man who transformed himself from B-movie thug to television's beloved attorney, Perry Mason. Born in British Columbia in 1917, Burr moved to California as a child, where he took his first stab at acting in a local theater group. Moving back and forth between bit parts in California and on Broadway, Burr finally signed a contract with RKO, despite his fictional r�sum� that claimed he spent time on the London stage. His deep baritone and imposing frame made him the perfect heavy in a string of RKO thrillers. But it was his role as Perry Mason on TV that made Burr a household name. Running from 1957 to 1966, the CBS courtroom drama featured Mason eliciting confessions on the witness stand and never losing a case to his arch nemesis, DA Hamilton Burger. Burr's private life, most notably his long-term relationship with Robert Benevides, was kept quiet, primarily through the dead spouses Burr invented along the way. Working steadily until his death in 1993 from cancer, Burr remained a television icon, following up the success of Mason with <i>Ironside</i>, where he played a paraplegic cop. Starr, who has biographies of Joey Bishop and Bobby Darin, does little to illuminate the actor or the man, and sidesteps a much-needed exploration of homosexuality in Burr's Hollywood. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She and her husband live in Arlington, Texas.<b>Chapter Two</b> <p> The highway was barely recognizable. Countless times, Sayre Lynch had driven this stretch of road between New Orleans International Airport and Destiny. But traveling it today was like doing so for the first time. </p><p> In the name of progress, landmarks that had made the area distinct had been obscured or obliterated. Rural Louisiana's charm had been sacrificed to gaudy commercialism. Little that was quaint or picturesque had survived the onslaught. She could have been in Anywhere, USA. </p><p> Fast-food franchises now occupied the spots where once had been mom-and-pop cafes. Homemade meat pies and muffaletta sandwiches had been replaced with buckets of wings and Value Meals. Hand-painted signs had given way to neon. Menus scribbled daily on chalkboards had been supplanted by disembodied voices at drive-through windows. </p><p> During the ten years she had been away, trees draped with Spanish moss had been bulldozed to allow for additional highway construction. This expansion had diminished the vastness and mystery of the swamps that flanked the road. The dense marshes were now ribboned with entrance and exit ramps jammed with semis and minivans. </p><p> Until now Sayre hadn't realized the depth of her homesickness. But these substantial changes in the landscape made her nostalgic for the way things had been. She longed for the mingled aromas of cayenne and fil�. She would like to hear again the patois of the people who served up Cajun dishes that took more than three minutes to prepare. </p><p> While superhighways made for faster travel, she wished for the roadway she had known, the one lined with trees that grew so close to it the branches overlapped to cover it like a canopy and cast lacy patterns of shadow on the asphalt. </p><p> She longed for the times she could drive with the windows down and, rather than choking on motor exhaust, inhale the soft air that was perfumed with honeysuckle and magnolia and the seminal scent of the swamp. </p><p> The changes that had come about in the past decade were jarring to her senses and an affront to her memories of the place in which she'd grown up. But then, she supposed that the changes in herself were equally drastic, although perhaps not as apparent. </p><p> The last time she'd driven this road, she'd been traveling in the opposite direction, away from Destiny. That day, the farther she got from home, the lighter she felt, as though she were molting layers of negativity along the way. Today she was returning, and her dread was as heavy as chain mail. </p><p> Homesickness for the area, no matter how acute, would never have brought her back. Only her brother Danny's death could have compelled her to return. Apparently he had withstood Huff and Chris for as long as he could and had escaped them in the only manner he'd felt was open to him. </p><p> Fittingly, as she approached the outskirts of Destiny, she saw the smokestacks first. They jutted belligerently above the town, large and black and ugly. Smoke billowed from them today as on every other day of the year. It would have been too costly and inefficient to have shut down the furnaces, even in observance of Danny's demise. Knowing Huff, it probably hadn't even occurred to him to make this concession to his youngest child. </p><p> The billboard marking the city limit read "Welcome to Destiny, Home of Hoyle Enterprises." <i>As though that's something to boast,</i> she thought. Quite the contrary. Iron pipe casting had made Huff rich, but it was a bloodstained wealth. </p><p> She navigated the streets of town which she had first explored on bicycle. Later she'd learned to drive on them. Then as a teen she had cruised them with her friends, looking for action, boys, and whatever amusements they could scare up. </p><p> While still a block away from the First United Methodist Church, she heard the organ music. The pipe organ had been a gift to the church from her mother, Laurel Lynch Hoyle. It bore a brass plaque in her memory. It was the small congregation's pride and joy, being the only pipe organ in Destiny. None of the Catholic churches had one, and Destiny was predominantly Catholic. Her mother's gift had been generous and sincere, but it was yet another symbol of how the Hoyles lorded over their town and everyone in it and refused to be outdone. </p><p> How heartbreaking that the organ was playing a dirge for one of Laurel Hoyle's children, who had died fifty years too soon, and by his own hand. </p><p> Sayre had received the news Sunday afternoon upon returning to her office from a meeting with a client. Ordinarily she wouldn't have worked on a Sunday, but that was the only day this particular client was free for an appointment. Julia Miller had recently celebrated her fifth year as Sayre's assistant. She wouldn't let Sayre work on a weekend without working herself. While Sayre was with the client, Julia had been catching up on paperwork. </p><p> When Sayre returned, Julia passed her a pink memo slip. "This gentleman has called three times, Ms. Lynch. I wouldn't give him your cell number, although he demanded it." </p><p> Sayre glanced at the area code, then wadded up the memo and tossed it into the wastepaper basket. "I don't wish to speak to anyone in my family." </p><p> "He's not family. He says he works for the family. It's imperative that he reach you as soon as possible." </p><p> "I won't talk to anybody who works for my family either. Any other messages? By any chance has Mr. Taylor called? He promised those valances by tomorrow." </p><p> "It's your brother," Julia blurted out. "He's dead." </p><p> Sayre stopped short of her private office. For a long moment she stared through the wall of windows toward the Golden Gate Bridge. Only the very tops of the orange supports were visible above a solid blanket of fog. The water in the bay looked gray, cold, and angry. Foreboding. </p><p> Without turning around, she asked, "Which one?" </p><p> "Which -- " </p><p> "Brother." </p><p> "Danny." </p><p> Danny, who had called her twice in the last several days. Danny, whose calls she had refused to take. </p><p> Sayre turned to face her assistant, who was regarding her sympathetically. She said gently, "Your brother Danny died earlier today, Sayre. I thought you should be told in person, not over a cell phone." </p><p> Sayre released a long breath through her mouth. "How?" </p><p> "I think you should speak with this Mr. Merchant." </p><p> "Julia, please. How did Danny die?" </p><p> Gently she said, "It appears he killed himself. I'm sorry." Then after a moment, she added, "That's all the information Mr. Merchant would give me." </p><p> Sayre then retreated to her private office and closed the door. She heard the phone in the anteroom ring several times, but Julia didn't put the calls through, realizing that she needed time alone to assimilate the news. </p><p> Had Danny been calling to tell her good-bye? If so, how would she live with the guilt of having refused to speak to him? </p><p> After about an hour, Julia knocked tentatively on the door. "Come in," Sayre called. When Julia stepped inside, Sayre said, "There's no point in your staying, Julia. Go home. I'll be fine." </p><p> The assistant laid a sheet of paper on her desk. "I've still got work to do. Buzz me if you need me. Can I bring you anything?" </p><p> Sayre shook her head no. Julia withdrew and closed the door. On the sheet of paper she'd brought in she'd written down the time and place of the funeral. Tuesday morning, eleven o'clock. </p><p> Sayre hadn't been surprised that it was scheduled so soon. Huff always acted with dispatch. He and Chris would be impatient to put this behind them, to bury Danny and get on with their lives as soon as possible. </p><p> However, the timeliness of the funeral had probably worked to her advantage, too. It prevented a lengthy internal debate on whether to attend. She couldn't languish in indecision but had been forced to make up her mind quickly. </p><p> Yesterday morning she'd caught a flight to New Orleans via Dallas-Fort Worth and had arrived in the late afternoon. She'd taken a walk through the French Quarter, eaten dinner at a gumbo shop, then spent the night at the Windsor Court. </p><p> For all the comfort the luxury hotel afforded, she'd had a virtually sleepless night. She <i>did not</i> want to go back to Destiny. She did not. Silly as it was, she feared walking into some kind of snare that would trap her there, keep her in Huff's clutches forever. </p><p> Daybreak hadn't lessened her dread. She'd gotten up, dressed for the funeral, and set out for Destiny, planning to arrive just in time for the service and to leave immediately thereafter. </p><p> The church parking lot was already overflowing into the surrounding neighborhood streets. She had to park several blocks away from the picture-book church with the stained-glass windows and tall white steeple. Just as she stepped onto the columned porch, the bell chimed the hour of eleven. </p><p> The vestibule was cool compared to outdoors, but Sayre noticed that many in the sanctuary were waving paper fans to supplement the inadequate air-conditioning. As she slipped into the back row, the choir finished singing the opening hymn and the pastor stepped up to the pulpit. </p><p> While everyone else bowed their heads for prayer, Sayre looked at the casket in front of the chancel rail. It was simple, silver, and sealed. She was glad of that. She didn't think she could bear her last image of Danny to be his lying like a wax doll in a satin-lined coffin. To prevent thoughts of that, she concentrated on the elegant purity of the arrangement of white calla lilies on top of the casket. </p><p> She couldn't see either Huff or Chris for the crowd, but she supposed they were seated in the front pew, looking appropriately bereaved. The hypocrisy of it all made her nauseated. </p><p> She was named among the surviving family members. "A sister, Sayre Hoyle of San Francisco," the minister intoned. </p><p> She wanted to stand up and shout that Hoyle was no longer her name. After her second divorce, she had begun using her middle name, which had been her mother's maiden name. She'd had her name legally changed to Lynch. That was the name on her college degree, her business stationery, her California driver's license, and her passport. </p><p> She wasn't...</p></p><h2>The Case of the Counterfeit Eye (Perry Mason Mysteries)</h2><p>A reissue of an original Perry Mason novel finds the legal eagle in the hire of a man whose missing glass eye is found in the hands of a slain millionaire businessman surrounded by suspects.

The seas whisperand dream of breaking truthsin the crumbling of stoneHantallit of Miner SluiceYear of the Late FrostOne year before the Letherii Seventh ClosureThe Ascension of the Empty HoldHere, then, is the tale. Between the swish of the tides, when giants knelt down and became mountains. When they fell scattered on the land like the ballast stones of the sky, yet could not hold fast against the rising dawn. Between the swish of the tides, we will speak of one such giant. Because the tale hides with his own.And because it amuses.Thus.In darkness he closed his eyes. Only by day did he elect to open them, for he reasoned in this manner: night defies vision and so, if little can be seen, what value seeking to pierce the gloom?Witness as well, this. He came to the edge of the land and discovered the sea, and was fascinated by the mysterious fluid. A fascination that became a singular obsession through the course of that fated day. He could see how the waves moved, up and down along the entire shore, a ceaseless motion that ever threatened to engulf all the land, yet ever failed to do so. He watched the sea through the afternoon&#x2019;s high winds, witness to its wild thrashing far up along the sloping strand, and sometimes it did indeed reach far, but always it would sullenly retreat once more.When night arrived, he closed his eyes and lay down to sleep. Tomorrow, he decided, he would look once more upon this sea.In darkness he closed his eyes.The tides came with the night, swirling up round the giant. The tides came and drowned him as he slept. And the water seeped minerals into his flesh, until he became as rock, a gnarled ridge on the strand. Then, each night for thousands of years, the tides came to wear away at his form. Stealing his shape.But not entirely. To see him true, even to this day, one must look in darkness. Or close one&#x2019;s eyes to slits in brightest sunlight. Glance askance, or focus on all but the stone itself.Of all the gifts Father Shadow has given his children, this one talent stands tallest. Look away to see. Trust in it, and you will be led into Shadow. Where all truths hide.Look away to see.Now, look away.The mice scattered as the deeper shadow flowed across snow brushed blue by dusk. They scampered in wild panic, but, among them, one&#x2019;s fate was already sealed. A lone tufted, taloned foot snapped down, piercing furry flesh and crushing minute bones.At the clearing&#x2019;s edge, the owl had dropped silently from its branch, sailing out over the hard-packed snow and its litter of seeds, and the arc of its flight, momentarily punctuated by plucking the mouse from the ground, rose up once more, this time in a heavy flapping of wings, towards a nearby tree. It landed one-legged, and a moment later it began to feed.The figure who jogged across the glade a dozen heartbeats later saw nothing untoward. The mice were all gone, the snow solid enough to leave no signs of their passing, and the owl froze motionless in its hollow amidst the branches of the spruce tree, eyes wide as they followed the figure&#x2019;s progress across the clearing. Once it had passed, the owl resumed feeding.Dusk belonged to the hunters, and the raptor was not yet done this night.As he weaved through the frost-rimed humus of the trail, Trull Sengar&#x2019;s thoughts were distant, making him heedless of the forest surrounding him, uncharacteristically distracted from all the signs and details it offered. He had not even paused to make propitiation to Sheltatha Lore, Daughter Dusk, the most cherished of the Three Daughters of Father Shadow&#x2014;although he would make recompense at tomorrow&#x2019;s sunset&#x2014;and, earlier, he had moved unmindful through the patches of lingering light that blotted the trail, risking the attention of fickle Sukul Ankhadu, the Daughter of Deceit, also known as Dapple.The Calach breeding beds swarmed with seals. They&#x2019;d come early, surprising Trull in his collecting of raw jade above the shoreline. Alone, the arrival of the seals would engender only excitement in the young Tiste Edur, but there had been other arrivals, in ships ringing the bay, and the harvest had been well under way.Letherii, the white-skinned peoples from the south.He could imagine the anger of those in the village he now approached, once he delivered the news of his discovery&#x2014;an anger he shared. This encroachment on Edur territories was brazen, the theft of seals that rightly belonged to his people an arrogant defiance of the old agreements.There were fools among the Letherii, just as there were fools among the Edur. Trull could not imagine this broaching being anything but unsanctioned. The Great Meeting was only two cycles of the moon away. It served neither side&#x2019;s purpose to spill blood now. No matter that the Edur would be right in attacking and destroying the intruder ships; the Letherii delegation would be outraged at the slaughter of its citizens, even citizens contravening the laws. The chances of agreeing upon a new treaty had just become minuscule.And this disturbed Trull Sengar. One long and vicious war had just ended for the Edur: the thought of another beginning was too hard to bear.He had not embarrassed his brothers during the wars of subjugation; on his wide belt was a row of twenty-one red-stained rivets, each one marking a coup, and among those seven were ringed in white paint, to signify actual kills. Only his elder brother&#x2019;s belt sported more trophies among the male children of Tomad Sengar, and that was right and proper, given Fear Sengar&#x2019;s eminence among the warriors of the Hiroth tribe.Of course, battles against the five other tribes of the Edur were strictly bound in rules and prohibitions, and even vast, protracted battles had yielded only a handful of actual deaths. Even so, the conquests had been exhausting. Against the Letherii, there were no rules to constrain the Edur warriors. No counting coup. Just killing. Nor did the enemy need a weapon in hand&#x2014;even the helpless and the innocent would know the sword&#x2019;s bite. Such slaughter stained warrior and victim alike.But Trull well knew that, though he might decry the killing that was to come, he would do so only to himself, and he would stride alongside his brothers, sword in hand, to deliver the Edur judgement upon the trespassers. There was no choice. Turn away from this crime and more would follow, in waves unending.His steady jog brought him past the tanneries, with their troughs and stone-lined pits, to the forest edge. A few Letherii slaves glanced his way, quickly bowing in deference until he was past. The towering cedar logs of the village wall rose from the clearing ahead, over which woodsmoke hung in stretched streams. Fields of rich black soil spread out to either side of the narrow, raised track leading to the distant gate. Winter had only just begun to release its grip on the earth, and the first planting of the season was still weeks away. By midsummer, close to thirty different types of plants would fill these fields, providing food, medicine, fibres and feed for the livestock, many among the thirty of a flowering variety, drawing the bees from which honey and wax were procured. The tribe&#x2019;s women oversaw the slaves in such harvesting. The men would leave in small groups to journey into the forest, to cut timber or hunt, whilst others set out in the Knarri ships to harvest from the seas and shoals.Or so it should be, when peace ruled the tribes. The past dozen years had seen more war-parties setting out than any other kind, and so the people had on occasion suffered. Until the war, hunger had never threatened the Edur. Trull wanted an end to such depredations. Hannan Mosag, Warlock King of the Hiroth, was now overlord to all the Edur tribes. From a host of warring peoples, a confederacy had been wrought, although Trull well knew that it was a confederacy in name only. Hannan Mosag held as hostage the firstborn sons of the subjugated chiefs&#x2014;his K&#x2019;risnan Cadre&#x2014;and ruled as dictator. Peace, then, at the point of a sword, but peace none the less.A recognizable figure was striding from the palisade gate, approaching the fork in the trail where Trull now halted. &#x2018;I greet you, Binadas,&#x2019; he said.A spear was strapped to his younger brother&#x2019;s back, a hide pack slung round one shoulder and resting against a hip; at the opposite side a single-edged longsword in a leather-wrapped wooden scabbard. Binadas was half a head taller than Trull, his visage as weathered as his buckskin clothes. Of Trull&#x2019;s three brothers, Binadas was the most remote, evasive and thus difficult to predict, much less understand. He resided in the village only infrequently, seeming to prefer the wilds of the western forest and the mountains to the south. He had rarely joined others in raids, yet often when he returned he carried trophies of coup, and so none doubted his bravery.&#x2018;You are winded, Trull,&#x2019; Binadas observed, &#x2018;and I see distress once more upon your face.&#x2019;&#x2018;There are Letherii moored off the Calach beds.&#x2019;Binadas frowned. &#x2018;I shall not delay you, then.&#x2019;&#x2018;Will you be gone long, brother?&#x2019;The man shrugged, then stepped past Trull, taking the westerly fork of the trail.Trull Sengar moved on, through the gate and into the village.Four smithies dominated this inland end of the vast walled interior, each surrounded by a deep sloping trench that drained into a buried channel that led away from the village and the surrounding fields. For what seemed years the forges had rung almost ceaselessly with the fashioning of weapons, and the stench of heavy, acrid fumes had filled the air, rising up to coat nearby trees in white-crusted soot. Now, as he passed, Trull saw that only two were occupied, and the dozen or so visible slaves were unhurried in their work.Beyond the smithies ran the elongated, brick-lined storage chambers, a row of segmented beehive-shaped buildings that held surplus grains, smoked fish and seal meat, whale oil and harvested fibre plants. Similar structures existed in the deep forest surrounding each village&#x2014;most of which were empt...</p></p><h2>Madeleine L&#39;Engle&#39;s Time Quartet Box Set (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters)</h2><p>With over 10 million copies in print, Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s Newbery Medal-winning classic, <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, along with its bestselling companions, <i>A Wind in the Door</i>, <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i>, and <i>Many Waters</i>, has enthralled and inspired readers of all ages.

Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, the company's founders, had acquired the Modern Library from publishers Boni and Liveright two years earlier. One day, their friend the illustrator Rockwell Kent stopped by their office. Cerf later recalled, "Rockwell was sitting at my desk facing Donald, and we were talking about doing a few books on the side, when suddenly I got an inspiration and said, 'I've got the name for our publishing house. We just said we were go-ing to publish a few books on the side at random. Let's call it Random House.' Donald liked the idea, and Rockwell Kent said, 'That's a great name. I'll draw your trademark.' So, sitting at my desk, he took a piece of paper and in five minutes drew Random House, which has been our colophon ever since." Throughout the years, the mission of Random House has remained consistent: to publish books of the highest quality, at random.

Crews was born in the middle of the Great Depression, in a one-room sharecropper&#39;s cabin at the end of a dirt road in rural south Georgia. If Bacon County was a place of grinding poverty, poor soil, and blood feuds, it was also a deeply mystical place, where snakes talked, birds could possess a small boy by spitting in his mouth, and faith healers and conjure women kept ghosts and devils at bay. At once shocking and elegiac, heartrending and comical, A Childhood not only recalls the transforming events of Crews&#39;s youth but conveys his growing sense of self in a world &#34;in which survival depended on raw courage, a courage born out of desperation and sustained by a lack of alternatives&#34;.Harry Crews is the author of eighteen novels, including <i>The Mulching of America</i>. He teaches at the University of Florida.

February 6, 1685), charting his daring flight to France after the Battle of Worcester, where Cromwell and his Protestant forces defeated the Catholic king. For six weeks, Charles' life was in danger as he hid in the English countryside, disguised as a servant, unable to find a way across heavily guarded borders. His loyal courtiers were appalled by the ease and glee with which he adopted his new humble identity, insisting on chatting and even drinking with ostlers and houseboys. Two young women were instrumental in his eventual escape and one of them became a lifelong friend of the exiled king.</p></p><p>Dispossessed of crown and kingdom, the young Charles II must flee for his life, across Cromwell&#39;s England bound for a Channel port and a ship to France. But the irrepressible King, with his love of adventure and his unmistakable looks, is not an easy man to hide.The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman.

With his precise, but lively, British accent, he eases listeners into the mysterious world hidden behind the wardrobe. There the suspense and tension mount as Lucy meets Tumnus and Edmund the White Witch. With flawless accuracy York seems to sense the very timbre of the White Witch's horrible voice and the anguish of the kind faun, Mr. Tumnus. York knows, as well, how excited the children are at coming upon Mr. and Mrs. Beaver at the very moment the forest has become so mysterious and they need some sensible friends to help them; later still we hear the gentle power of Aslan, as well as his fury. Michael York gives to each an unforgettable vocal characterization that will surely live in our children's memories as the Grinch or Scrooge lives in ours. P.E.F.

Nonte, Jr. The small arms field continues to be very active; significant new weapons appear with great regularity in both the non-Communist and Communist world. The importance of these most basic of all weapons is universally accepted now; some years ago there were some who questioned the &#34;relevancy&#34; of small arms in the nuclear age. Sadly, the grim experiences of recent years have taught us that they are still very &#34;relevant&#34; and that there is a strong case for continuing to expend the necessary energy and resources to ensure quality weapons in sufficient quantity for protection and sport.

With recipe headers and introductions to the chapters that exhibit the chef's trademark exuberance, this book is sure to appeal to fans of his show. Appetizers include Tunisian Stewed Potatoes with paprika and cardamom and Tuna and White Bean Spread on Garlic Toast with a dash of Tabasco. Pastas like Pasta Alfredo, Pasta with Tomato Sauce, Ricotta and Romano Cheese, and Spaghetti and Meatballs are virtuously simple but surprisingly predictable and are not among the pasta dishes that Stellino claims have been influenced by non-Italian cuisines. Other national traditions are more apparent in main dishes like Mediterranean Shepherd's Pie (the mashed potato topping has Romano cheese incorporated), Moussaka, and Ginger Tuna. Vegetable side dishes are simple, and Stellino also includes some more unusual accompaniments like Chickpeas with Mint and Tomatoes, Couscous Spinach Pilaf, and a yeast-free Sardinian Cracker Bread. Desserts such as Strawberries in Marsala with Sweetened Ricotta and Coffee Cheesecake round out these reliable, though unexceptional selections. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Fans of the PBS Italian cooking series <i>Cucina Amore</i> will rejoice to learn that chef Stellino has broadened his television show's Italian-only cooking to explore a wider range of Mediterranean foods, encompassing European, North African, and Asian traditions. Hence, Stellino conjures up recipes for dishes as diverse as pasta, couscous, and paella. Nonetheless, Italian recipes continue to dominate Stellino's repertoire, attracting the less venturesome cook. Stellino prudently keeps his recipes as simple and uncomplicated as possible. Sidebar reminiscences of family members add a personal touch and mirror related excursuses from Stellino's television cooking classes. Stellino's cuisine breaks no new ground and his instructions assume basic kitchen competence, but his enthusiastic television presentations and warm personality ensure library patron demand for this volume wherever his PBS show airs. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i></p><h2>Glass Sword [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2012] NA</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p>If there s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it s that she s different.</p><p>Mare Barrow s blood is red the color of common folk but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control.</p><p>The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince the friend who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: She is not the only one of her kind.</p><p>Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors.</p><p>But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat.</p><p>Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of rebellion?

His only success long behind him, Monte lives simply with his wife and son. But when he befriends outlaw Glendon Hale, a new world of opportunity and experience presents itself. Glendon has spent years in obscurity, but the guilt he harbors for abandoning his wife, Blue, over two decades ago, has lured him from hiding. As the modern age marches swiftly forward, Glendon aims to travel back to his past--heading to California to seek Blue&#x2019;s forgiveness. Beguiled and inspired, Monte soon finds himself leaving behind his own family to embark for the unruly West with his fugitive guide.

Four years and six unfinished novels later, Becket sits on the porch of his Minnesota farmhouse about to give up on number seven, when he spies a man standing up in his boat "rowing upstream through the ropy mists of the Cannon River." Eager to set aside his waning tale about handsome ranch hand Dan Roscoe, Becket calls out to the mysterious white-haired boatman and his life changes forever. At turns merry and wistful, romantic and tragic, <i>So Brave, Young, and Handsome</i> is as absorbing as a campfire tale, full of winking outlaws and relentless villains--the sort of story to keep you on the edge of your seat with hope in your heart. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><b>Leif Enger</b> is the author of <i>Peace Like a River.</i> He was raised in Osakis, Minnesota, and worked as a reporter and producer for Minnesota Public Radio for nearly twenty years.

Over the next four years, as Charles Moore relates in this central volume of his uniquely authoritative biography, Britain&#x2019;s first woman prime minister changed the course of her country&#x2019;s history and that of the world, often by sheer force of will.<br><br> The book reveals as never before how Mrs. Thatcher transformed relations with Europe, privatized the commanding heights of British industry and continued the reinvigoration of the British economy. It describes her role on the world stage with dramatic immediacy, identifying Mikhail Gorbachev as &#x201c;a man to do business with&#x201d; before he became leader of the Soviet Union, and then persistently pushing him and Ronald Reagan, her great ideological soul mate, to order world affairs according to her vision. For the only time since Churchill, she ensured that Britain had a central place in dealings between the superpowers.<br><br> But even at her zenith she was beset by difficulties. Reagan would deceive her during the U.S. invasion of Grenada. She lost the minister to whom she was personally closest to scandal and faced calls for her resignation. She found herself isolated within her own government. She was at odds with the Queen over the Commonwealth and South Africa. She bullied senior colleagues and she set in motion the poll tax. Both these last would later return to wound her, fatally.<br><br> Charles Moore has had unprecedented access to all of Mrs. Thatcher&#x2019;s private and government papers. The participants in the events described have been so frank in interviews that we feel we are eavesdropping on their conversations as they pass. We look over Mrs. Thatcher&#x2019;s shoulder as she vigorously annotates documents and as she articulates her views in detail, and we understand for the first time how closely she relied on a handful of trusted advisers to carry out her will. We see her as a public performer, an often anxious mother, a workaholic and the first woman in Western democratic history who truly came to dominate her country in her time.<br><br> In the early hours of October 12, 1984, during the Conservative party conference in Brighton, the IRA attempted to assassinate her. She carried on within hours to give her leader&#x2019;s speech at the conference. One of her many left-wing critics, watching her that day, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t approve of her as Prime Minister, but by God she&#x2019;s a great tank commander.&#x201d; This titanic figure, with all her capabilities and her flaws, storms from these pages as from no other book.<br><br></p></p><p><b>CHARLES MOORE</b>&nbsp;was born in 1956 and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read history. He joined the staff of <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph </i>in 1979, and as a political columnist in the 1980s covered several years of Mrs. Thatcher&#x2019;s first and second governments. He was editor of <i>The Spectator</i> from 1984 to 1990; editor of <i>The Sunday Telegraph </i>from<i> </i>1992 to1995; and editor of <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>from 1995 to 2003, for which he is still a regular columnist. The first volume of his biography of Margaret Thatcher, published in 2013, has won multiple awards for distinguished achievement in biography and history.The woman Prime Minister who flew into what The Times called a &#x2018;lavish, colourful ceremony of the kind not seen in the American capital for the past four years&#x2019; had a packed schedule, but was also careful to make the right impression.* Her office set aside forty minutes each day for hairdressing (with rollers), and submitted her personal details in preparation for receiving an honorary degree at Georgetown University: &#x2018;Height 5'4";** Weight 10.5 stone; Coat 14 English; Hat size 7&#x2019;. In the White House, Reagan welcomed her, declaring, &#x2018;we share laws and literature, blood, and moral fibre&#x2019;, and she responded, &#x2018;The message I have brought across the Atlantic is that we, in Britain, stand with you. America&#x2019;s successes will be our successes. Your problems will be our problems, and when you look for friends we will be there.&#x2019; The private reception was equally warm, which encouraged Mrs Thatcher to be frank. In his diary, Reagan recorded: &#x2018;We had a private meeting in Oval office. she [sic] is as firm as ever re the Soviets and for reduction of govt. Expressed regret that she tried to reduce govt. spending a step at a time &amp; was defeated in each attempt. Said she should have done it our way &#x2013; an entire package &#x2013; all or nothing.&#x2019;<br><br> But not everyone in the Reagan administration was willing to be as supportive as the President. On the same day, Don Regan testified before a Congressional committee. Mrs Thatcher, Regan said, had failed to control the money supply, produced &#x2018;an explosive inflationary surge&#x2019; by her pay increases to public employees and kept taxes too high, which &#x2018;provides little incentive to get the economy started again&#x2019;. &#x2018;She failed&#x2019;, he added, &#x2018;in the effort to control the foreign exchange market and the pound is so high in value that it ruined their export trade.&#x2019; Here was a clear effort to distance the administration&#x2019;s policy from the perceived mistakes associated with Margaret Thatcher. Such perceptions were commonplace in US media reports throughout the visit.*** Regan then left Capitol Hill to hurry over to the British Embassy for lunch with Mrs Thatcher.&nbsp;<br><br> She did not react unfavourably, but publicly praised President Reagan, giving a sanitized version of what she had told him privately: his attack on expenditure was &#x2018;the one thing which I could have wished that we had been even more successful at&#x2019;. Reagan recorded in his diary that Mrs Thatcher &#x2018;Went up to the hill [Capitol Hill] and was literally an advocate for our ec. program. Some of the Sen&#x2019;s. tried to give her a bad time. She put them down firmly &amp; with typical British courtesy.&#x2019;<br><br> As far as issues of substance went, the visit was fairly thin. Mrs Thatcher was a little worried by the administration&#x2019;s obsession with Central America, when she felt more attention should be paid to the East-West relationship. She and Reagan did, however, discuss the Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev&#x2019;s speech of 23 February in which he had called for an international summit and a moratorium on Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) in Europe, and they agreed on a cautious response. More important, for both sides, was the need for �clat, for the dramatization of the &#x2018;meeting of minds&#x2019; of which Dick Allen had written. The state dinner for Mrs Thatcher at the White House gave Reagan&#x2019;s people the chance to show the difference their President made:<br><br> &#x201c;The Reaganauts were determined to throw off the grungy, downtrodden look of the Carter Administration . . . Some of the Carter people used to walk about the White House in bare feet. As soon as Reagan came in, out went the memos banning jeans, banning sandals and requiring everyone to wear a suit. &#x2018;Glamour&#x2019; was a word often used, and &#x2018;class&#x2019; too. The Reagan people thus planned the Thatcher dinner as a white tie affair. It was going to be infused with Hollywood glamour and would show the world how classy the Reagan people were.&#x201d;<br><br> Mrs Thatcher, however, asked the White House if the dinner could be black tie, since &#x2018;some of her people would not have the requisite clothing&#x2019;. She had another concern too: &#x2018;she was the grocer&#x2019;s daughter. She didn&#x2019;t want to come over here dressed up like that. It was an impoverished time in Britain after all.&#x2019; Black tie was agreed, but the dinner was still grand enough in all conscience.<br><br> Then there was the return match. Taking advantage of the Reagan team&#x2019;s inexperience, Nicko Henderson had got Dick Allen to promise that the President would come to the customary reciprocal dinner at the British Embassy the following night. This was in violation of the existing convention that only the Vice-President attended these return dinners, but the Reagan team did not know this. By the time they had realized their mistake and tried to get out of it, Henderson had sent out the invitations. Reagan came with a good grace.**** In her speech that night, Mrs Thatcher added her own passage to Henderson&#x2019;s draft, words about the &#x2018;two o&#x2019;clock in the morning courage&#x2019; which leaders have to have when faced with lonely decisions. This greatly pleased Reagan, who replied that she herself had already shown such courage &#x2018;on too many occasions to name&#x2019;. &#x2018;Truly a warm &amp; beautiful occasion,&#x2019; Reagan wrote in his diary. The only disappointment for Mrs Thatcher was that the Reagans left without dancing to the band. After they had departed, Henderson invited her on to the floor: &#x2018;Mrs T accepted my offer without complication or inhibition, and, once we were well launched on the floor, confessed to me that that was what she had been wanting to do all evening. She loved dancing, something, so I found out, she did extremely well.&#x2019;129 She was most reluctant to go to bed, threatening a different sort of &#x2018;two o&#x2019;clock courage&#x2019; by going off to see the floodlit Washington monuments, &#x2018;but Denis put his foot down, crying, &#x201c;bed&#x201d;.&#x2019; On her last night in America, after a rapturous reception for a speech in New York, Mrs Thatcher gathered with Denis, Henderson and aides in her suite in the Waldorf before taking the plane home. &#x2018;Mrs T was still in a state of euphoria from the applause she had received which was indeed very loud and genuine and burst out: &#x201c;You know we all ought to go dancing again&#x201d; . . . Denis&#x2019; foot came down heavily.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Both sides rejoiced at the visit. &#x2018;It was a great success,&#x2019; Henderson remembered. &#x2018;They saw completely eye to eye.&#x2019; &#x2018;We needed a crowbar to pull them apart,&#x2019; remarked Reagan&#x2019;s press secretary, Jim Brady. &#x2018;I believe a real friendship exists between the P.M. her family &amp; us,&#x2019; Reagan commented. The essence of this friendship was simple and effective. They believed the same things, and they both wanted to work actively to bring them about. &#x2018;I have full confidence in the President,&#x2019; Mrs Thatcher scribbled at the bottom of a thank-you note to Henderson. &#x2018;I believe he will do things he wants to do &#x2013; and he won&#x2019;t give up.&#x2019; They also had compatible, though utterly different, temperaments &#x2013; he the relaxed, almost lazy generalist who charmed everyone with his easygoing ways, she the hyperactive, zealous, intensely knowledgeable leader, who injected energy into all her doings but also displayed what Reagan considered to be the elegance of a typical, gracious English lady. They shared a moral outlook on the world and also, in their emphasis on formality, dressing smartly and being what Americans call classy, a sort of aesthetic. The personal chemistry was undeniable. &#x2018;He treated her in a very courteous and sort of slightly flirtatious way, to which she responded,&#x2019; recalled Robin Butler. It turned out that they would often disagree about tactics, and that his more optimistic and her less sunny view of the possibilities of a non-nuclear future would lead to problems, but their basic personal trust and sense of common purpose never failed.<br><br> Yet, for all her enthusiasm and affection for the leader of the free world, Mrs Thatcher was not blind to his limitations. Lord Carrington recalled their meeting on the first day:<br><br> &#x201c;After the arrival ceremony we went into the Oval Office and I remember Reagan saying: &#x2018;Well of course, the South Africans are whites and they fought for us during the war. The blacks are black and are Communists.&#x2019; I think even Margaret thought this was rather a simplification . . . She came out and she turned to me and, pointing at her head, she said, &#x2018;Peter, there&#x2019;s nothing there.&#x2019; That wasn&#x2019;t exactly true, because there was something there and she no doubt didn&#x2019;t really mean that.&#x201d;<br><br> Mrs Thatcher came to realize that Reagan&#x2019;s strengths and mental abilities were very different from her own, but she never lost her underlying admiration for him. To the typed letter of thanks she sent him, she added, in her own hand: &#x2018;We shall never have a happier visit.&#x2019;138 She felt she had a powerful friend. She knew that he would help in the economic and political struggles ahead. Her pleasure and gratitude were genuine.<br><br>-<br><br><i>Notes</i><br><br> * Mrs Thatcher&#x2019;s nervousness before the ceremony is indicated by the row she began at Blair House, the official guest house where she and her party were staying. She fiercely attacked Lord Carrington for what she called &#x2018;your policy in the Middle East&#x2019;, which she considered dangerous in its attempt at a rapprochement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, adding, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll lose my seat at Finchley.&#x2019; By his own account, her Foreign Secretary said, &#x2018;And I&#x2019;ll lose my temper,&#x2019; and went out, slamming the door (interview with Lord Carrington). Clive Whitmore hurriedly scribbled a note to Mrs Thatcher which said, &#x2018;This place is bugged.&#x2019; She then drew a circle in the air with her finger to indicate bugging. (Interview with Sir Clive Whitmore.)<br><br> ** Mrs Thatcher sometimes gave her height as 5 foot 4 inches, and sometimes as 5 foot 5 inches.<br><br> *** &#x2018;A new verb has entered the Washington lexicon,&#x2019; declared the New York Times. &#x2018;It is said to be possible to &#x201c;Thatcherize&#x201d; an economy. The verb is not precisely defined, but many see it as a bad thing to do. Since &#x201c;Thatcherization&#x201d; bears a conservative label, some people fear that our new conservative President will lead us down the same disagreeable path.&#x2019; (New York Times, 1 Mar. 1981.)<br><br> **** Although Henderson&#x2019;s manoeuvring annoyed the sticklers for protocol, Allen and others realized that the President&#x2019;s attendance at this return dinner (and others) could have its advantages. This would be one way, suggested an NSC memo, to &#x2018;underscore the substantive importance&#x2019; Reagan placed on US relations with key allies, and signal a break with the discord in the transatlantic alliance seen in the recent past.

This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the German with an introduction by Idris Parry. &#39;Somebody must have laid false information against Josef K., for he was arrested one morning without having done anything wrong.&#39; From this first sentence onwards, Josef K. is on trial for his right to exist. Once arrested, he is released, but must report to court on a regular basis - an event that proves maddening, as nothing is ever resolved. As he grows more uncertain of his fate, his personal life - including work at a bank and his relations with his landlady and a young woman who lives next door - becomes increasingly unpredictable. As K. tries to gain control, he succeeds only in accelerating his own excruciating downward spiral. Maintaining an atmosphere of unease throughout, this chilling, thought-provoking novel, more than any other, is infinitely perceptive about the nature of terror and the absurd meaninglessness and futility of human life. Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was a Czech-born German-speaking insurance clerk who despised his job, preferring to spend his time writing. Nevertheless, Kafka published little during his lifetime, and ordered his closest friend to burn the mass of unpublished manuscripts - now familiar to us as some of the most influential novels and short stories of the twentieth century - after his death. Kafka&#39;s novels, all available in Penguin Modern Classics, include The Trial, The Castle, and Amerika. If you enjoyed The Trial, you might like Kafka&#39;s The Castle, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;This compelling, prophetic novel anticipates the insanity of modern bureaucracy and the coming of totalitarianism&#39; Daily Telegraph &#39;It is the fate and perhaps the greatness of [The Trial] that it offers everything and confirms nothing&#39; Albert Camus</p><p>A terrifying psychological trip into the life of one Joseph K., an ordinary man who wakes up one day to find himself accused of a crime he did not commit, a crime whose nature is never revealed to him.

Daly places the current crisis within a much broader historical context, showing how it is only the latest in a series of transitions that have required journalists to devise new ways of plying their trade.<br><br>Drawing on original research and synthesizing the latest scholarship, Daly traces the evolution of journalism in America from the early 1700s to the "digital revolution" of today. Analyzing the news business as a business, he identifies five major periods of journalism history, each marked by a different response to the recurrent conflicts that arise when a vital cultural institution is housed in a major private industry.<br><br>Throughout his narrative history Daly captures the ethos of journalism with engaging anecdotes, biographical portraits of key figures, and illuminating accounts of the coverage of major news events as well as the mundane realities of day-to-day reporting.</p><p>A veteran journalist, Christopher B.

A professor of journalism now at Boston University, Daly spent 10 years as an AP editor and reporter and a decade at <i>The Washington Post</i> before moving to academia.

Her abductor immediately kills the youth, then keeps the girl as his captive. He tortures her, binds her with chains, and forces her to pose for photographs in heavy makeup and suggestive clothing. After several days he strangles her with a bailing-wire garrote, then dumps her body in the loft of an abandoned barn.</p><p>A twenty-one-year-old woman with no history of arrest or psychiatric problems becomes emotionally attached to a male corpse at the funeral home where she works. After his burial she grieves for the deceased, growing so distraught that coworkers complain of her behavior, and she is forced to resign.</p><p>Three years later, while employed at a second funeral home, she again develops a romantic interest in a dead body. Determined this time not to lose the object of her macabre desire, she moves his embalmed remains to an isolated place where she spends three days alone with the body. In a lengthy, handwritten account of the two incidents, she describes touching the second corpse and positioning it so as to simulate cuddling and fondling.</p><p>Three male children, ages seven, nine, and ten, take a female playmate to an isolated building where they forcibly undress her and demand that she perform oral sex on them. They insert sticks, rocks, and bottles into her vagina and rectum before releasing the little girl with a threat to kill her if she tells. The three are later identified and arrested after assaulting another young female playmate.</p><p>Before my retirement on January 1, 1994, I spent sixteen years examining these shocking crimes, and many others, as a member of the FBI&#x2019;s Behavioral Science Unit. Most people associate the BSU with its best-known responsibility, profiling, a discipline that was dramatized in the book and movie Silence of the Lambs. The fictional heroine, Special Agent Clarice Starling, and her nemesis, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, lent a touch of Hollywood glamour to our often grim and harrowing investigations.</p><p>But besides working the occasional high-profile serial murder case or testifying at the defendant&#x2019;s trial, our work also had a less-known side. Since the BSU opened for business in 1972, its personnel have studied aberrant crime, taught classes, and consulted&#x2014;out of the spotlight&#x2014;in scores of ongoing cases. And all the while, we were learning.</p><p>In my research, I chose to focus on previously unexplored or poorly understood deviant behaviors. These practices, ranging from dangerous autoeroticism to sexual sadism, brought me face-to-face with dark instincts I had never imagined existed.</p><p>The most appalling murder I ever encountered was that of a young girl discovered with her intestines wrapped around her neck. The child vanished one evening as she walked a short fifty feet to the next-door neighbors&#x2019; house. A few hours later, her body was found several blocks away. She also had been raped and beaten to death. To my knowledge, the crime was never solved.</p><p>In another case, a man hanged himself after leaving twenty-seven suicide notes around his home, garage, and car. Perhaps the most surprising incident of my career was the bleeding death of a woman who nearly amputated her own arm at the shoulder with a butcher knife.</p><p>My casework taught me several essential lessons. The first is that there are no boundaries to what a particular individual might do to other people or to him- or herself. The second lesson is equally wide-ranging: When it comes to sexual behavior, there are no limits to what a person might find erotically stimulating.</p><p>Among violent sexual offenders, often the only logic to their crimes is internal. The criminal alone knows why he commits his deviant acts. Although we can find patterns and common elements among them, no two offenders ever commit exactly the same sexual crime. In the world of dark minds, the darkness truly is infinite.</p><p>The sexual component of a crime is not always self-evident either. The behavior may be blatant, or it may be so subtle that it escapes detection, even by experts. Then again, some crimes may only seem to be sexually motivated.</p><p>I once worked for a public defender whose client was accused of the robbery/murder of an elderly woman. The victim was discovered dead on the floor at the foot of her bed. She had been struck twice in the face with sufficient force (according to the medical examiner) to have stunned her or rendered her unconscious. The cause of death was two stab wounds in the chest. Her pants and panties had been pulled down to just above her knees.</p><p>There was no sign of forced entry or of a struggle. All doors and windows were secured. Her purse, containing credit cards, was missing. But more than twenty thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of jewelry and in excess of forty thousand dollars in negotiable securities were left untouched in her unlocked office safe in an adjacent room.</p><p>An ATM security camera caught my public defender&#x2019;s client attempting to guess the victim&#x2019;s cash card number. When he was later arrested, he told the police he&#x2019;d found the card at a bus stop in a bad neighborhood of town.</p><p>I know that&#x2019;s an unlikely sounding story, but I believed him. Here&#x2019;s why:</p><p>He&#x2019;d stupidly allowed himself to be videotaped in front of the ATM, trying to guess the card code. Yet the prosecution contended that this inadequate criminal supposedly was smart and savvy enough to enter a total stranger&#x2019;s house, leaving no physical trace of himself. Then he approached the victim in her bedroom and struck and stabbed her twice before she could raise a hand in her defense.</p><p>If this defendant had been capable of such improbable sophistication, I said, then surely he also would have searched the open safe to steal her jewels and securities.</p><p>I thought this was a staged crime. Someone who knew the victim had killed her then pulled down her clothing to suggest a sexual motive in the case. Further, I said, if I had been that person, I too would have left her credit cards in a rough area, knowing that some punk would try to use them.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t testify in the case. But the public defender presented my logic via her arguments and questioning and persuaded the jury that this defendant lacked the cunning to have committed the crime. The case remains officially unsolved.</p><p>Thanks to the vast diversity of human nature, an investigator may expect to encounter a wide range of behaviors. Offenders may be attracted to nonliving objects (fetishism), animals (bestiality), or people. Or they may be drawn to all three.</p><p>Some people preferentially act out their desires with prepubescent children (pedophiles), teenagers (hebephiles), or the elderly (gerontophiles). Others select age mates as their victims, and a few will sexually assault victims of any age.</p><p>Certain offenders commit exclusively homosexual crimes, others limit themselves to offenses against heterosexuals, and still others are attracted to either gender.</p><p>Ted Bundy is an example of a necrophiliac, the term used for one who preferentially assaults the dead. Yet to the vast majority of sexual criminals (as to the rest of us!), such an act is abhorrent.</p><p>Some sexual crimes involve only the sense of sight (voyeurism and exhibitionism), only the sense of hearing (telephone scatology), or only the sense of touch (frotteurism). However, most offenders will employ all of the available senses.</p><p>Many offenders are aroused by a victim&#x2019;s suffering (sadists), while others are excited by their own pain (masochists). Then there are sadomasochists, who may be aroused in either way&#x2014;simultaneously or in separate incidents.</p><p>Highly ritualistic behavior marks some types of sexual crimes, while others are characterized by impulsiveness. At times, we find strange mixes of both ritualism and spontaneity.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve encountered sexual offenders who almost always seriously injured or murdered their victims. For others, such injury greatly diminishes or destroys the gratification process.</p><p>A victim&#x2019;s torment may be protracted by extended captivity. Conversely, as in cases involving comatose patients, those under anesthesia, or victims who have been given the &#x201c;date rape&#x201d; drug Rohypnol, the target might be completely unaware of what is happening.</p><p>Some offenders select victims who are total strangers. Others attack those who are well acquainted with them&#x2014;associates, clients, patients, customers, students, or relatives. In short, you name it&#x2014;anything is to be expected with sexual criminals.</p><p>Sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to draw the line between criminal and noncriminal sexual behavior. After all, many practices that would have shocked previous generations in our country tend to be more common today. The distinction between what is acceptable and what is not may even depend on the jurisdication where the behavior takes place.</p><p>A detective in one of my courses brought to my attention a case involving a woman and two of her dogs. When she brought some film into her local pharmacy for processing, the employee who developed it saw that the photos depicted the customer having sex with the dogs. The police were called, and an investigator presented the matter to the local prosecutor.</p><p>After examining the pictures, the assistant district attorney asked if the dogs belonged to the woman. Why would that matter? the investigator wondered aloud. &#x201c;Because if they don&#x2019;t belong to her, she can be charged with animal abuse,&#x201d; the prosecutor explained. &#x201c;But if the dogs are hers, there has been no criminal violation in this state.&#x201d;</p><p>Although certain aberrant sexual practices (such as dangerous autoeroticism) are not crimes, society still officially condemns most deviant sexual behavior. This is especially true when children are the victims. Yet ironically, we are increasingly permissive toward the graphic portrayal of sexual violence in practically all forms of the media. Magazines, television, and the Internet are rife with explicit and often violent sexual fare.</p><p>In my experience this climate of tolerance is having two important social consequences: First, as deviant behavior becomes more common in the material we read, hear, and see, parallel behaviors quickly appear in sexual crimes, particularly those acted out against strangers. Second, an increasing number of serious injuries and/or deaths are occurring during &#x201c;rough sex.&#x201d; When criminal charges are filed, defense attorneys try to portray the injurious behavior as &#x201c;consensual and accidental.&#x201d;</p><p>I have been retained by defense lawyers in three murder cases in which the defendant claimed that his partner&#x2019;s death occurred during voluntary &#x201c;erotic asphyxiation,&#x201d; one form of rough sex. In each case the attorney asked me to review the evidence and advise whether or not I could testify that the death was an accident.</p><p>For different reasons I told each of these clients that I would be unable to assist in the defense because the facts indicated that the manner of death was homicide. Yet in other cases, defense attorneys succeed in presenting a plausible scenario of accidental death. In our &#x201c;anything goes&#x201d; society, it can be difficult to convince a judge or jury that any behavior is necessarily involuntary.</p><p>Who commits sexual crimes? You may be surprised (as I often am) at the wide range of answers to this question.</p><p>Often, when I address audiences and classes, I tell them about the case that opened this chapter&#x2014;the one in which a fourteen-year-old girl was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered. After dumping her body, the killer anonymously taunted a member of his victim&#x2019;s family by relating truthful, but investigatively useless, details about the location where he left her dead body. He said, for instance, that she would be found in a barn. That was true, but of no help in locating her.</p><p>When he was arrested some months later, investigators searched his residence. There they found a trove of telling artifacts&#x2014;the undeveloped film he had shot of the victim during her captivity, articles of her clothing, bondage paraphernalia, detective magazines, and a variety of weapons.</p><p>After presenting the facts of the case, I ask my listeners to guess what the killer looked like. Their responses are as varied as the audience members themselves. However, when I show them two photographs of this criminal, practically everyone gasps in surprise.</p><p>The &#x201c;monster&#x201d; who committed these heinous crimes was a well-groomed, middle-aged man, six feet tall, and weighing about 185 pounds. In one of the photographs, he is wearing a police uniform; in the other, he is dressed as an airline pilot. Is this the image you expected for a sexual criminal?</p><p>My audiences&#x2014;usually professionals who work within the criminal justice system&#x2014;often feel uneasy when they see these pictures for the same reason that I do: the sexual killer looks so normal. He looks like us, and that resemblance is very disturbing.</p><p>Professionals and laymen alike, we all want sexual offenders to look like perverts so that we can readily identify them in our neighborhoods, schools, and shopping malls. Unfortunately, with the vast majority of sexual offenders, it just doesn&#x2019;t work that way.</p><p>In the early 1980s, when authorities in Texas arrested drifter Henry Lee Lucas, hardly a soul expressed any skepticism over Lucas&#x2019;s claim to have murdered as many as six hundred people. Why? Because, according to popular stereotype, Henry Lee Lucas looked like a pervert! He was unshaven, poorly groomed, shabbily dressed. Nearly penniless, he drove a worn-out wreck of a car. Everything about him was uncouth.</p><p>His alleged accomplice, Ottis Toole, looked just as bad, if not worse. The appearances of both men fit well within the public&#x2019;s perception of what a serial killer should look like.</p><p>We at the BSU cringed when we saw the pictures of Lucas and Toole. We knew that they would reinforce the mistaken notion that sexual offenders typically look different from other people&#x2014;and thus encourage many innocent victims to overlook dangers that come in more ordinary forms.</p><p>In the late 1970s, before Lucas and Toole were captured, we hoped that Ted Bundy had effectively disproved the public&#x2019;s mistaken perceptions. Bundy was handsome, well-spoken, and educated. He did not appear capable of the horrible sexual crimes for which he was accused and later convicted. Bundy&#x2019;s arrest made a lot of people very uncomfortable because it forced them to rethink their previous ideas about sexual criminals. When Bundy stood trial for two murders in Florida, his wholesome appearance complicated the prosecutors&#x2019; job. Fortunately, both juries heeded the evidence, and Bundy was convicted and sentenced to death.</p><p>In contrast, Richard Ramirez, the Los Angeles killer known as &#x201c;the Night Stalker,&#x201d; fit the public&#x2019;s stereotypical concept of serial killers. In thirteen months Ramirez murdered at least thirteen victims whose ages ranged from six to eighty-four. He sexually assaulted and, in some cases, mutilated the victims after death. Ramirez had dark, penetrating eyes, disheveled black hair, a pentagram on one hand, and poor dental hygiene. He was difficult to control in court, often erupting into verbal and physical obscenities. Richard Ramirez was mentally disturbed, and he looked it!</p><p>Sadly, violent crimes committed by the severely disturbed tend to attract a disproportionate amount of attention from the press. In fact, the mentally ill are responsible for less than 3 percent of sexual crimes. Such people usually pose a greater threat to themselves than others. Richard Ramirez was an exception to the rule.</p><p>Who is the sexual offender? A few examples demonstrate the wide range of individuals who fit the description.</p><p>Jon Barry Simonis was a for...</p></p><h2>The Seven Continents of the World: Jigsaw Book</h2><p>This is an educational book of jigsaw puzzles with brightly colored illustrations and maps.

But outsiders, blocked by the closed Soviet system, couldn&#x2019;t get to it. Then the Soviet Union collapsed, and a wholesale rush into the region erupted. Along with oilmen, representatives of the world&#x2019;s leading nations flocked to the Caspian for a share of the thirty billion barrels of proven oil reserves at stake, and a tense geopolitical struggle began. The main players were Moscow and Washington&#x2013;the former seeking to retain control of its satellite states, and the latter intent on dislodging Russia to the benefit of the West. <br><i>The Oil and the Glory</i> is the gripping account of this latest phase in the epochal struggle for control of the earth&#x2019;s &#x201c;black gold.&#x201d; Steve LeVine, who was based in the region for <i>The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and <i>Newsweek</i>, weaves an astonishing tale of high-stakes political gamesmanship, greed, and scandal, set in one of the most opaque corners of the world. In LeVine&#x2019;s telling, the world&#x2019;s energy giants jockey for position in the rich Kazakh and Azeri oilfields, while superpowers seek to gain a strategic foothold in the region and to keep each other in check. At the heart of the story is the contest to build and operate energy pipelines out of the landlocked region, the key to controlling the Caspian and its oil. The oil pipeline that resulted, the longest in the world, is among Washington&#x2019;s greatest foreign policy triumphs in at least a decade and a half. <br>Along the way, LeVine introduces such players as James Giffen, an American moneyman who was also the political &#x201c;fixer&#x201d; for oil companies eager to do business on the Caspian and the broker for Kazakhstan&#x2019;s president and ministers; John Deuss, the flamboyant Dutch oil trader who won big but lost even bigger; Heydar Aliyev, the oft-misunderstood Azeri president who transcended his past as a Soviet Politburo member and masterminded a scheme to loosen Russian control over its former colonies in the Caspian region; and all manner of rogues, adventurers, and others drawn by the irresistible pull of untold riches and the possible &#x201c;final frontier&#x201d; of the fossil-fuel era. The broader story is of the geopolitical questions of the Caspian oil bonanza, such as whether Russia can be a trusted ally and trading partner with the West, and what Washington&#x2019;s entry into this important but chaotic region will mean for its long-term stability.<br>In an intense and suspenseful narrative,<i> The Oil and the Glory</i> is the definitive chronicle of events that are understood by few, but whose political and economic impact will be both profound and lasting.<br><br>"The collapse of the Soviet Union was a big opportunity for Big Oil, whose exploits are detailed in this fast-paced work of political and economic reportage by <i>Wall Street Journal</i> energy correspondent LeVine.<br>Westerners had been sniffing for black gold in Russia and its satellites long before the empire disintegrated, notes the author. Averell Harriman, &#x201c;the Harvard-trained scion of nineteenth-century robber baron Edward Harriman,&#x201d; tried his hand at the business before turning to manganese mining, while Armand Hammer &#x201c;became a money launderer for the Bolsheviks, sneaked cash to secret Bolshevik agents in the United States, and profited handsomely as the representative in Russia of some thirty American companies.&#x201d; Hammer set the tone for the Americans who flocked to the Caspian in the first years of the Clinton presidency, which maneuvered for the construction of an east-west oil pipeline that, by reversing the old pattern of Central Asian materials going north to Russia and coming back as products for sale, &#x201c;would favor the West and disfavor Russia.&#x201d; Not a nice way to treat a fledgling democracy, but the oil scouts, of course, considered Russia a rival for Central-Asian resources second only to Iran, with its heartfelt and long-standing enmity toward the United States in the region and abroad. These scouts&#x2013;the first among equals being LeVine&#x2019;s heart-of-darkness antihero, Jim Giffen&#x2013;kept their distance when Russia still had control over the area, spurning a Gorbachev-era program to allow foreign co-ownership. But they rushed to support separatist movements and encouraged ethnic and political divisions that opened the door to an even bigger share of the wealth. The tale of Giffen&#x2019;s rise and fall (the latter for perhaps surprising reasons) occupies much of the later pages, but he never loses sight of the bigger picture: namely, Central Asia as oil lamp and potential powder keg in the realpolitik of the next few years.<br>A complex story rendered comprehensible, with much drama and intrigue."--KIRKUS</p><p>Pipeline politics became a modern day version of the 19th Century&#39;s Great Game, in which Britain and Russia had employed cunning and bluff to gain supremacy over the lands of the Caucasus and Central Asia.

For thousands of years these people developed the tools and technologies to fell the giant cedars that grew in profusion. They used the rot-resistant wood for graceful dugout canoes to travel the coastal waters, massive post-and-beam houses in which to live, steam bent boxes for storage, monumental carved poles to declare their lineage and dramatic dance masks to evoke the spirit world.</p><p>Every part of the cedar had a use. The versatile inner bark they wove into intricately patterned mats and baskets, plied into rope and processed to make the soft, warm, yet water-repellent clothing so well suited to the raincoast. Tough but flexible withes made lashing and heavy-duty rope. The roots they wove into watertight baskets embellished with strong designs. For all these gifts, the Northwest Coast peoples held the cedar and its spirit in high regard, believing deeply in its healing and spiritual powers. Respectfully, they addressed the cedar as Long Life Maker, Life Giver and Healing Woman.</p><p>Anecdotes, oral history and the accounts of early explorers, traders and missionaries highlight the text of <b><i>Cedar</i></b>. <b>Hilary Stewart</b>'s 550 drawings and a selection of 50 photographs depict how the people made and used the finished products of the incomparable tree of life to the Northwest Coast Indians -- the cedar.</p></p><p><strong>Hilary Stewart</strong> is an award-winning author best known for her books on Northwest Coast First Nations cultures.

More than 70 years later, it stands alone in carrying on the tradition of bringing great Southern cooking to everyone from blue collar workers to celebrities.<br><br>Now you can bring home many of the restaurant's famed recipes, along with richly illustrated photography, old menus, postcards, and artwork from its magnificent history.</p><p>John Ferrell purchased Mary Mac's Tea Room in 1994 from the original owner. Margaret Lupo handpicked Ferrell to share her historic business and recipes, and her vast knowledge of down-home Southern food. Ferrell has expanded the business while still maintaining the beloved traditions of "Atlanta's Dining Room."<br><br> Mary Mac's Tea Room has been serving up classic Southern comfort food to the people of Atlanta, Georgia, since opening in 1945. The last of the city's old Southern tea rooms, Mary Mac's thrives today, serving more than 1,000 customers every day.Mary Mac&#x2019;s Tea Room, an Atlanta institution, had prospered under two different owners since its beginnings in 1945. In the early 1990s, new owners almost bankrupted the restaurant&#x2014;and left it on dining life-support. New owner (and author) Ferrell came to the rescue, who, with friends, family, and no little elbow grease, restored its innards&#x2014;and its soul&#x2014;to serve 1,000 meals every day. This is a homey 125-recipes-with-stories cookbook, filled with southern dishes such as pot likker (the juice from greens), hush puppies, and oyster stew. Check your cholesterol-reducing statins at the table; after all, the first sentence in many of these recipe instructions is &#x201c;Line a plate with paper towels and set aside.&#x201d; The preparations are simple, with equally as streamlined ingredients (though one might scratch a head trying to figure out where to find, for instance, a large whole chicken hen).

The Dominican friar has long been portrayed as a dour, puritanical demagogue who urged his followers to burn their worldly goods in "the bonfire of the vanities." But as Martines shows, this is a caricature of the truth--the version propagated by the wealthy and powerful who feared the political reforms he represented. In fact, Savonarola emerges as a complex and subtle man: compassionate, wise, a poet and scholar, and even, at critical moments, a force for moderation. The friar, a mesmerizing preacher, set the city afire with his message of Christian charity wedded to republican ideals.<br> It is this reality--of Savonarola as both religious and civic leader--that Martines captures in all its complexity, showing how he inspired an outpouring of political debate in a city newly freed from the tyranny of the Medici. In the end, the volatile passions he unleashed--and the powerful families he threatened--sent the friar to his own fiery death. But the fusion of morality and politics that he represented would leave a lasting mark on Renaissance Florence. <br> For the many readers fascinated by histories of Renaissance Italy--such as <em>Brunelleschi's Dome</em> or <em>Galileo's Daughter</em>, and Martines's acclaimed <em>April Blood--Fire in the City</em> offers a vivid portrait of one of the most memorable characters from that dazzling era.</p><p><br><strong>Lauro Martines</strong> is Professor Emeritus of European History at the University of California, Los Angeles. A renowned scholar of Renaissance Italy, he now writes regularly for <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>. The author of <em>April Blood: Florence and the Plot Against the Medici</em>, he lives in London with his wife, the novelist Julia O'Faolian. His novel of Renaissance Italy, <em>Loredana</em>, won the Sagittarius Prize for 2005.<br><br>"A rich and fascinating portrait of Girolamo Savonarola, the Dominican friar who ruled Florence after the fall of the Medicis. Enraged by church corruption, he led a Florentine council for 20 years--until his enemies burned him at the stake in 1498."--<em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"Impressive narrative power.... A thoroughly good read that is also reliable history, scrupulously documented yet with its pages uncluttered by footnotes.... As in every tragedy, the pace quickens as the atmosphere darkens around the protagonist; and when all occasions begin to conspire against him, the reader is caught up in the pity, the cruelty--and the inevitability--of his fate.... Savonarola's story...bears fresh retelling, and Lauro Martines does so with scholarly authority and an admirable combination of clarity and pace."--Sir Michael Levey, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Martines is one of our most renowned historians of the Italian Renaissance and of Florence in particular. His new book is, in some ways, a successor to <em>April Blood</em> , his account of the 'Pazzi' conspiracy to assassinate Lorenzo de' Medici in 1478. Together the two volumes make up an engrossing study of society and politics during the Tuscan city's most illustrious half century."--Michael Dirda, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"Martines writes like an angel, and his judgments are nuanced and humane.... Makes a convincing case that history treated Savonarola unfairly: he was an eloquent preacher and a sagacious political advisor to the city.... This book will be read with profit by both professional scholars and general readers."--<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"Martines's fast-paced study weaves a first-rate social history of Renaissance Florence with a deeply affecting and more complex portrait of Savonarola.... This absorbing account by Martines captures Savonarola's brilliance as well as the exciting and dangerous days of Renaissance Florence."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br></p><h2>The Pope of Greenwich Village</h2><p>When three small-time hoods rob a Mafia safe and stumble upon a dead cop in the process, they find themselves relentlessly hunted and able to trust no one--least of all each other</p><p>Vincent Patrick has a work background appropriate for a novelist&#x2019;s book jacket.

The tranquillity of a cruise along the Nile is shattered by the discovery that Linnet Ridgeway has been shot through the head. She was young, stylish and beautiful, a girl who had everything -- until she lost her life. Hercule Poirot recalls an earlier outburst by a fellow passenger: &#39;I&#39;d like to put my dear little pistol against her head and just press the trigger.&#39; Yet in this exotic setting&#39; nothing is ever quite what it seems!</p><p>Hercule Poirot is perhaps Agatha Christie's most interesting and endearing character; short, round, and slightly comical, Poirot has a razor-sharp mind and puts unlimited trust in his "little grey cells." Those little cells come through for him every time, enabling Poirot to solve some of the most baffling mysteries ever conceived. In <i>Death on the Nile</i>, Poirot, on vacation in Africa, meets the rich, beautiful Linnet Doyle and her new husband, Simon. As usual, all is not as it seems between the newlyweds, and when Linnet is found murdered, Poirot must sort through a boatload of suspects to find the killer before he (or she) strikes again.Agatha Christie's genius for detective fiction is unparalleled.

Reissue.</p><p>DeceasedNero Wolfe fans may be surprised when the detective who never leaves home embarks on an international adventure. He sneaks into Yugoslavia, manipulates communist officials and anti-communist guerillas, climbs craggy hills, and hunts down his adopted daughter's killer. His sidekick, Archie Goodwin, is right beside him, pulling knives and guns on cue and narrating the adventure with his trademark dry wit. Michael Prichard's narration is strong and fluid, his voice resonant. His pacing is as perfect as his portrayal of Wolfe. Readers accustomed to Timothy Hutton's Archie Goodwin on A&amp;E might be jarred initially but are likely to be drawn in by Pritchard's powerful performance. The peek inside Tito's Yugoslavia in the mid-twentieth century is a fascinating plus.

Updated to include the latest developments in wine, this edition features never before seen archival photographs.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Hugh Johnson is recognized as the world's favourite wine writer. Hugh Johnson's first book and internationally bestselling Wine was published in 1966, and subsequent award-winning titles, including Story of Wine and Wine Companion, now in its fifth edition, have established him as one of the subject's foremost writers. He then went on to write The World Atlas of Wine, also now in its fifth edition and co-authored with Jancis Robinson. His annually updated Pocket Wine Book sells over 400,000 copies each year. Hugh lives in Essex. Margaret Rand, Editor of this edition, is an award-winning wine writer and a former editor of Wine International. She is the co-author (with Oz Clarke) of Grapes &amp; Wines and the General Editor of Hugh Johnson's Pocket Wine Book and Mitchell Beazley's Classic Wine Library series. Margaret also contributes to a wide range of international publications. Margaret lives in London.First published in 1989 in an illustrated 480-page edition, Johnson's sweeping chronicle of the making, merchandising and drinking of wine has been considerably pared down but remains brimful of fascinating information. Beginning with what we know of oenology in ancient Egypt and Greece, the text travels up to the 21st century, citing, for example, countries that produced the "most exciting wines" of 2003. Along the way, famed wine writer Johnson revisits the ongoing debate of who is responsible for introducing vineyards into France, reveals that the coupling of bottle and cork in the 17th century allowed wine to age properly and recalls Thomas Jefferson declaring that wine was "the only antidote to the bane of whiskey." Sidebars throughout relate sprightly anecdotes, such as the story of Magellan stocking his ships for the 1519&#x2013;1521 circumnavigation of the globe (he spent more on sherry than he did on armaments&#x2014;and then got himself killed en route). Some 125 maps and illustrations in lush color and b&amp;w depict everything from a 5,000-year-old panel that is the first known illustration of wine drinking to a striking photo of a hyper-modernistic winery in Spain. While necessarily less comprehensive than the initial edition, this version is a thorough survey of the elixir that, as Johnson says, owes its popularity to its power to banish care. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Original.</p><p>Since 1977, Penelope Fitzgerald has been quietly coming out with small, perfect devastations of human hope and inhuman (i.e., all-too-human) behavior. And now we have the opportunity to read "The Bookshop," her tragicomedy of provincial manners first published in 1978 in the U.K., but never available in the U.S. <i>The Bookshop</i> unfolds in a tiny Sussex seaside town, which by 1959 is virtually cut off from the outside English world. Postwar peace and plenty having passed it by, Hardborough is defined chiefly by what it doesn't have. It does have, however, plenty of observant inhabitants, most of whom are keen to see Florence Green's new bookshop fail. But rising damp will not stop Florence, nor will the resident, malevolent poltergeist (or "rapper," in the local patois). Nor will she be thwarted by Violet Gamart, who has designs on Florence's building for her own arts series and will go to any lengths to get it. One of Florence's few allies (who is, unfortunately, a hermit) warns her: "She wants an Arts Centre. How can the arts have a centre? But she thinks they have, and she wishes to dislodge you." <p> Once the Old House Bookshop is up and running, Florence is subjected to the hilarious perils of running a subscription library, training a 10-year-old assistant, and obtaining the right merchandise for her customers. Men favor works "by former SAS men, who had been parachuted into Europe and greatly influenced the course of the war; they also placed orders for books by Allied commanders who poured scorn on the SAS men, and questioned their credentials." Women fight over a biography of Queen Mary. "This was in spite of the fact that most of them seemed to possess inner knowledge of the court--more, indeed, than the biographer." But it is only when the slippery Milo North suggests Florence sell the Olympia Press edition of "Lolita" that Florence comes under legal and political fire. </p><p> Fitzgerald's heroine divides people into "exterminators and exterminatees," a vision she clearly shares with her creator--but the author balances disillusion with grace, wit, and weirdness, favoring the open ending over the moral absolute. Penelope Fitzgerald's internecine if gentle world view even extends to literature--books are living, jostling things. Florence finds that paperbacks, crowding "the shelves in well-disciplined ranks," vie with Everyman editions, which "in their shabby dignity, seemed to confront them with a look of reproach." One senses that classic hardcovers would welcome <i>The Bookshop</i>, despite its status as a paperback original. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Mariner paperback, 1997, previous ISBN 978-0-395-86946-8</p><h2>Salt Sugar Smoke: How to preserve fruit, vegetables, meat and fish</h2><p>This comprehensive book takes a fresh look at preserving, offering all the basic information you need, but also featuring inspirational recipes from the store cupboards of the world. It covers everything from jams to cures, and shows you that you don't have to have lots of kit and produce to make delicious preserves - or wait forever before eating them.<br><br> There are sections filled with expert advice on choosing ingredients and cooking every type of preserve, from marmalades to jellies to relishes to foods preserved in oil. All the classic recipes are included and Diana often gives tips for how to make a version of a classic that suits your palette. For example, she includes a sweet and sticky strawberry jam, a more-fruity and less sweet version, and a Swedish 'nearly' strawberry jam (which is more like a conserve and keeps in the fridge for only a couple of weeks). <br><br> But this is also a treasure trove of recipes taken from the world's store cupboards. And most of them are luxuries that can be made from cheap ingredients - such as Thai spiced rhubarb relish, Alsace pear and Riesling jam and tea-smoked trout. Many recipes will also offer alternative ingredients - for example, make sloe gin with cranberries or plums.<br></p><p>Diana Henry has been awarded "Cookery Writer of the Year" by the Guild of Food Writers twice in the past three years.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Set in the English countryside, the hilarious memoir is as much about the author&#39;s love for plants as it is about the village in which he lived. The depictions of flowers and ornamentals - &#34;A single one of those gloxinias would be an event in Allways ... I should give a party for it&#34; - are both inspiring and unforgettable. This is the voice of one whose chief endowment is an appreciation for plants and the landscape, including a keen understanding of the importance gardens play in an increasingly modern world.</p><p>The third book in the Allways trilogy, A Village in a Valley is a delightful exploration of the village of Glatton---for which Allways is a pseudonym---and the people who lived and gardened there. Set in the English countryside, this hilarious memoir is as much about the author&#39;s love for plants, as it is about the village in which he lived.Beverley Nichols (1898&#x2013;1983) was a prolific writer on subjects ranging from religion to politics and travel, in addition to authoring six novels, five detective mysteries, four children's stories, six autobiographies, and six plays. He is perhaps best remembered today for his gardening books. The first of them, <i>Down the Garden Path,</i> centered on his home and garden at Glatton and has been in print almost continuously since 1932. <i>Merry Hall</i> (1951) and its sequels <i>Laughter on the Stairs</i> (1953) and <i>Sunlight on the Lawn</i> (1956) document Nichols' travails in renovating a Georgian mansion and its gardens soon after the war. His final garden was at Sudbrook Cottage, which serves as the setting for <i>Garden Open Today</i> (1963) and <i>Garden Open Tomorrow</i> (1968). The progress of all three gardens was followed avidly by readers of his books and weekly magazine columns.</p><h2>The Second Shift</h2><p><p>Fifteen years after its first publication, <b>The Second Shift</b> remains just as important and relevant today as it did then.

So although I went looking for &#x201c;quintessential American food,&#x201d; my conclusion is that there is no such thing; instead there&#x2019;s a huge wealth of seriously exciting dishes.</b></p> <p>Many of us outside of America may think we already know all there is to know about it from movies or the occasional holiday, but the truth is that this doesn&#x2019;t even scratch the surface. In many ways, the country is still a bit of a mystery to us. This trip was my chance to explore the ingredients, food culture, and traditions within this incredible country.</p> <p>I felt that I knew cities like New York and Los Angeles pretty well, but this time I ventured beyond the neighborhoods I was familiar with and into areas better known for their immigrant communities. I was rewarded with some of the most incredible food I&#x2019;ve ever tasted.</p> <p>The story was the same when I moved beyond the big cities. Whether it was Creole cooking in Louisiana or soul food in Georgia, the Mexican influences in Arizona or the hearty cowboy cuisine of Big Sky Country, every place I went had its unique treasures.</p> <p>I came back with more recipes than I knew what to do with, and although it was tough, I managed to narrow this book down to 120 of my absolute favorites. These are my takes on some of the best food I came across, as well as a few things I made up along the way. I hope you enjoy them, and maybe even discover new and inspiring sides to America you&#x2019;ve never seen before.

He is thirty-three and lives in London with his wife Jools and their daughters, Poppy and Daisy.Oliver returns with his 10th cookbook, this one a colorful and quirky look at down-home American cooking. Traveling to the cities of New York and Los Angeles, as well as Louisiana, Georgia, Arizona, and Wyoming, Oliver paints a somewhat unbalanced portrait of American cuisine. However, what he covers, he covers well, and, in many cases, he puts his own touches on American classics. From New York, he showcases Waldorf salad made with yogurt, and cheesecake topped with meringue. Louisiana's popcorn alligator and aioli and Arizona's rustic tortilla soup emphasize only a fragment of the multitude of ethnic influences that shape our food creations. The cultural differences between Georgia and Wyoming are shown in stark contrast with Southern pecan and apple salad, and mountain meatballs. Los Angeles's tuna in roasted salsa and Redondo mackerel wraps round out Oliver's culinary tour. Scattered among the many recipes and numerous color photos of each region are sidebars on region-specific cultural influences such as Chinatown, gator hunting, and campfire cooking. Uneven but still insightful, especially for Americans who have not journeyed to these areas, these dishes offer a glimpse into some of the best America has to offer. (Oct.)

But the prison guards a horrible secret, one that will push both brothers to the cusp of something much greater and darker than they ever imagined.</p></p><p><p>BRIAN EVENSON is the author of <i>Last Days</i> (formerly titled Brotherhood of Mutilation) and <i>The Open Curtain</i> (Coffee House), which was a finalist for an Edgar Award and an IHG Award and was among Time Out New York's top books of 2006.

He has received an O. Henry Prize as well as an NEA fellowship.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>When he was young, Jensi Sato had no idea that anything was wrong with his brother. Istvan had always been the way he was&#x2014;always a little off, obsessed with patterns and numbers, entranced by shifts in light, prone to sudden fits of rage or mental absence. Or he had changed so gradually that Jensi, around him every day, hadn&#x2019;t noticed how different he had become. <br>As boys, they roamed the projects together, raising hell, heads always aching from breathing the thin, imperfect atmosphere of the dome they lived in on Vindauga. Really, it was Istvan raising hell and Jensi, younger, following along. But Jensi was glad to be included. And even if he didn&#x2019;t always quite understand why Istvan did what he did, he did want to get out of the house, did want to get away from their mother. <br>By the time he was in his teens, Jensi had begun to see how different Istvan was. His brother wasn&#x2019;t like other people. Most of the time, he didn&#x2019;t know how to talk to other people, and when he did the things he said didn&#x2019;t have the effect he thought they would. He saw how the other boys looked at Istvan strangely, how they drew away from him, then from both of them. Soon Jensi and Istvan were pretty much left to themselves. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t as easy as saying that Istvan wasn&#x2019;t normal, because in basic ways he was, more or less. He could get by if he had to, could usually make his way through brief and ordinary interactions without a tremor. But the more time you spent around him, the stranger he seemed. He lived in his own world, always getting caught up in the shapes and patterns he saw around him&#x2014;patterns that Jensi often couldn&#x2019;t see. Istvan grew frustrated with other people quickly. He was less able to pay attention to others. It never occurred to him to care what other people thought of him, and he also wasn&#x2019;t afraid. Really, the only person he ever listened to was Jensi, and he only listened to him sometimes, only reluctantly letting himself be coaxed out of real trouble. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>At age twelve, Jensi was out with Istvan, wandering through the compound where they lived, searching for something to do. The Mariner Valley compound was kept separate from the larger domes that comprised the rest of the town by a tube, and it was only later that Jensi realized this was because they lived in low-income housing into which all the undesirables on Vindauga were pushed. <br>That day, there had been a half dozen children a few years younger than them crouched near the outer wall of the dome, near a place where the inner wall had been cracked and rendered opaque. There was a slow leak there, quickly compensated for by the dome&#x2019;s oxygen protocol. The kids kept daring one another to get close to it. Holding their breath, one of them would run to the dome wall, touch the opaque section, and run back. The others would slap him on the back in congratulation and then would push at another boy until he did it, too. <br>&#x201c;What kind of game is that?&#x201d; asked Istvan, directing the question to none of them and all of them at once. <br>Most of the boys just ignored him, looking away as if they hadn&#x2019;t heard. One, the biggest, just shrugged. &#x201c;Just something to do,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not even dangerous,&#x201d; said Istvan. &#x201c;How can it be fun pretending something&#x2019;s dangerous when it&#x2019;s not?&#x201d; <br>Jensi put his hand on his shoulder. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Leave them alone. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; <br>But Istvan shook the hand off. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to play a real game?&#x201d; he asked them. <br>Defensive, the leader of the boys said, &#x201c;It <i>is</i> a real game.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Istvan. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not. You can&#x2019;t just run up close to it and run back. It&#x2019;s calling you to perfect it. That&#x2019;s the game it wants to play. Can&#x2019;t you see the shape is wrong?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It?&#x201d; said one of the boys. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; <br>Isvtan gestured toward the damaged section of dome. The boys glanced that way and Jensi followed their gaze. What would make the shape of it right or wrong? he wondered. What was Istvan seeing? <br>&#x201c;Do you want to see a real game?&#x201d; asked Istvan. <br>The boys stayed huddled together, arms crossed, silent. <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; said Jensi again to his brother. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you want to see or not,&#x201d; said Istvan. &#x201c;It wants to play.&#x201d; He leaned forward, locking his arms behind his back. He pawed the filthy ground with his feet and then, suddenly, screaming, he charged. <br>The group of kids scattered. But he wasn&#x2019;t aiming at them. He rushed past them without a glance and ran smack into the opaque portion of dome wall, his forehead striking it hard. Jensi felt his heart leap in his throat. <br>There was a hiss, and the cracks worsened, the shape of the opaque section expanding, but the plate, luckily, did not give. Istvan, though, did give, collapsing in a heap, his forehead smeared with blood. The scattered boys re-formed and stood huddled at a distance. Jensi ran quickly forward, knelt beside his brother. <br>&#x201c;Istvan?&#x201d; he said, shaking him. &#x201c;Istvan? Why would you do that?&#x201d; <br>Blood dripped slowly from his forehead. For a moment Istvan&#x2019;s eyes were glazed and loose in the sockets, and then they slowly focused on his brother. And then he smiled and let his gaze drift back to the opaque part of the wall. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now the shape is right. Now we know what&#x2019;s really there.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Jensi had tried to ask him about it later, but Istvan had been unable to explain in a way that Jensi could follow. Istvan&#x2019;s brain was always hunting for patterns, always making connections that Jensi had a hard time seeing himself. Istvan had seen the crack in the dome and had known, he claimed, what he needed to do. The crack had called to him. He knew what it wanted him to do and what it would take to make it whole. <br>&#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s that supposed to mean? Make it whole?&#x201d; <br>Istvan had tried to explain, but he just couldn&#x2019;t. His attempts at making sense of his thinking for Jensi just led him further and further into confusion until Jensi finally stopped him. <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;You sound crazy. You shouldn&#x2019;t tell anybody this.&#x201d; <br>And for once his brother listened, and stopped talking. Which made it so that any hope that Jensi had of figuring out what Istvan meant was drastically reduced. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>When Jensi was fourteen, a group of girls chalked on the ground an old game one of them had read about in the vid library: a series of numbered squares, all connected, that you had to hop through, skipping squares according to a predetermined pattern. The girls were standing around the game, arguing about how you knew which squares you had to skip. Istvan, though, had been drawn by the numbers in the squares, his head rapidly swiveling from one to the next. He had simply walked through the group of girls, almost as if he didn&#x2019;t notice them. He knocked one of them down, scattering the handful of rocks they had gathered, crushing the chalk. The girls were yelling at him, the one on the ground crying and holding up her skinned elbow accusingly, but Istvan was now standing over the squares. Gingerly, he stepped into one, then leaped into another, then leaped back, following a complex pattern that only he could see until with a final leap he came to the top of the game and stepped carefully out again. <br>Once out, he stopped as if paralyzed. He stared at the uneven ground past the game. Jensi, not knowing what else to do, went to him. <br>&#x201c;That was mean,&#x201d; he said. <br>But Istvan didn&#x2019;t answer. Instead he squatted and brushed his finger along the ground, tracing an irregular shape on it. <br>Angrily, Jensi batted his brother&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why did you have to be so mean to them?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see it?&#x201d; said Istvan. &#x201c;How they drew the right pattern and then it led me here?&#x201d; He traced the shape again, his eyes gleaming. Jensi, squinting, could barely make out what Istvan was looking at, an unevenness in the ground, a tusk-shaped discoloration that made the ground just slightly different. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect,&#x201d; said Istvan, and reached down to stroke it again. <br>&#x201c;Istvan,&#x201d; said Jensi. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you? It&#x2019;s just the ground.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; said Istvan. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; It was like he was coming out of a trance. Quickly he stood up. Then he turned and looked back at the girls. They stood with their hands on their hips, still angry, though no longer yelling. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with them?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;You ruined their game.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I did?&#x201d; said Istvan. He seemed genuinely puzzled, as if he really didn&#x2019;t remember. He stayed staring at them a moment, then his features grew hard. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t know what they were playing,&#x201d; he claimed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only one who knows.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Jensi thought of the many times he had woken up in their bedroom late at night to hear his brother. Istvan would be mumbling, talking in his sleep, but the same pattern of words would be repeated over and over again, endlessly. Or he would be sitting on the edge of his bed, somewhere between sleep and wakefulness, rocking back and forth, rattling about a sequence of numbers, his voice almost worshipful. He was like that; he loved numbers and patterns, could get lost in them. They were almost like people to him, but people were less interesting. He also seemed to pick up things naturally about computers, had been hacking since he was nine, and had taught Jensi how to do the same. But here it was numbers, mumbled, repeated again and again. <br>&#x201c;Istvan,&#x201d; Jensi would whisper. But Istvan wouldn&#x2019;t hear him. <br>Sometimes Jensi was lucky and his brother would simply stop on his own. Other times, though, he threatened to rock back and forth forever. Jensi would get up and shake him but sometimes even that wouldn&#x2019;t stop him. It was as if he were elsewhere, as if he had stepped outside of his body for a while. Sometimes it took a very long time for him to step back in. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>I should have known,</i> thought Jensi once he was grown. <i>I should have known how wrong things were for him. I should have known how damaged he was. I should have tried to get him help. I should have been able to save him.</i> <br>But how&#x2014;another part of him wondered, a part he tried hard to suppress&#x2014;how could he have known? He was the younger brother, after all. There was only so much he could do. And his mother, no, she didn&#x2019;t believe in doctors, thought that God would sort everything out on his own and that you shouldn&#x2019;t interfere. He had, actually, tried several times to tell her that something was wrong with Istvan. But each time she had looked up at him with bleary eyes. <br>&#x201c;Wrong?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Of course there&#x2019;s something wrong with him. He&#x2019;s evil.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s gone wrong inside of him. Something&#x2019;s wrong with his mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Evil is in him,&#x201d; muttered his mother. &#x201c;He needs to have it driven out.&#x201d; And then, with horror, he realized that he&#x2019;d given his mother an excuse to hurt his brother. <br>But as Istvan grew older and bigger his mother started leaving him alone. She would curse him from the other side of the room, tell him that he was vile, but she no longer touched him. She was a little afraid of him. And that meant she no longer laid a finger on Jensi, either. She became more and more withdrawn. Or maybe she had always been that way and Jensi hadn&#x2019;t realized. Had Istvan gotten whatever was wrong with him from her? Was it something genetic, something inherited? And did that mean that Jensi might have it inside himself as well? No, he didn&#x2019;t want to be like his mother. He didn&#x2019;t want to be like his brother, either, but he loved his brother, felt responsible for him. Istvan had always looked out for him. Maybe now, now that his brother was becoming strange, it was Jensi&#x2019;s turn. It was time for him to look out for his brother. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Istvan was seventeen, Jensi fifteen, when things started to go seriously wrong. It started with their mother. <br>They had come back from another day of wandering through the Mariner Valley compound. When they arrived, their apartment door was ajar, their mother&#x2019;s passkey lying on the hall floor. They pushed open the door and saw a spill of dropped assistance packages, their mother lying in the middle of them, her body shivering. <br>Jensi crouched down beside her. He tried to turn her over to see her face, but it was hard. Her body was stiff, resistant. <br>&#x201c;Help me, Istvan,&#x201d; he said to his brother. <br>But Istvan just stayed where he was. He was looking not at his mother, but at the packages. Jensi watched him mumble, gesture at them with his finger, tracing a figure through the air. <br>&#x201c;Istvan,&#x201d; he said again. &#x201c;Help!&#x201d; <br>But Istvan was in a trance, mesmerized by the pattern made by the fallen packages. He was muttering under his breath, and then his eyes traced the pattern round again and then began to stare into empty air. Their mother, Jensi saw, was foaming at the mouth. The foam was red-flecked and he could see between her teeth and lips her tongue, partly bitten through. <br>&#x201c;This is serious,&#x201d; he said. And when Istvan still didn&#x2019;t respond, he screamed his brother&#x2019;s name. <br>His brother flinched, then shook his head, then looked down. His expression was unfathomable. <br>&#x201c;She might die,&#x201d; said Jensi. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Istvan, but he made no move to help. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see him?&#x201d; he asked slowly. <br>&#x201c;See what?&#x201d; asked Jensi. <br>&#x201c;The shadow man,&#x201d; said Istvan. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s choking her.&#x201d; <br> <i>The shadow man?</i> &#x201c;Istvan,&#x201d; said Jensi slowly. &#x201c;Go to the vid and call emergency.&#x201d; <br>And slowly, almost like a sleepwalker, not taking his gaze away from the boxes, Istvan did. <br>Jensi held his mother, talked to her, and stroked her face until the emergency crew arrived. He massaged her jaw over and over until it relaxed enough to release her tongue and then he turned her head to the side so she wouldn&#x2019;t choke on the blood. Istvan, after making the call, simply stood on the opposite side of the room, watching. He refused to come close. <i>The shadow man?</i> wondered Jensi. <i>What did he mean by that? He was crazy.</i> <br> <i>If I hadn&#x2019;t been here,</i> thought Jensi later as they took his mother away, <i>Istvan would have let her die.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Istvan had come through the door only to stop stock still, breathless. There it was, he could see it, the same pattern, just the same, glimmering. He had seen it so many times before, again and again, just waiting for someone to come along and see it and put it together&#x2014;just waiting for <i>him</i> to come put it together, because the world called to him in a different way than to others. There was his mother, lying sprawled on the floor, but that wasn&#x2019;t important, she wasn&#x2019;t important. She wasn&#x2019;t part of the <i>arrangement</i>. She didn&#x2019;t tell him anything about what was real. She was just in the way. <br>No, what was important were the things she had been holding and the way they had fallen when she had dropped them, the way that each of them, tumbling out of her hands, had found its true and proper place. Things were like that. They told him something. They gave him a rough sketch of something else, something grander, something hidden. He could feel it, sense it, but it was far away, too deeply buried to make out completely. So he could only have this, this arrangement of packages that marked out something else, pointed to something else that he could almost see but couldn&#x2019;t quite. <br>Only maybe he could have more than that. <br>He held himself very still. He held his breath. He stared as hard as he could, letting his eyes follow the lines between things, connecting them, spinning from object to object. He...</p><h2>The Art of Listening</h2><p>Though thought of as a social commentator, Erich Fromm was first and foremost a psychoanalyst of our time. These writings combine two aspects of his thinking, showing how he builds on Freudian theory and also modifies it with his own humanist point of view.</p><p>Born in Frankfurt-am-Main, <b>Erich Fromm</b> (1900-1980) studied sociology and psychoanalysis. In 1933, he emigrated as a member of the Frankfurt School of social thinkers to the United States, moved to Mexico in 1950, and spent his twilight years between 1974 and 1980 in Switzerland. His books <i>Fear of Freedom</i> (1941) and <i>The Art of Loving</i> (1956) made him famous. Other well-known books are Marx's <i>Concept of Man</i>, <i>Beyond the Chains of Illusion</i>, and <i>The Essential Fromm</i>.While the coming of August is enough to send most psychoanalysts fleeing the needs of their patients for the beach, it appears that not even death can keep the wizened Fromm (On Being Human, 1993, etc.) from dispensing wisdom. Fromm gained renown less for his writings about clinical psychology than for his more contemplative works that fused the insights of psychoanalysis with those of existentialist philosophy to ask--and occasionally answer- -the Big Questions traditionally left to priests, rabbis, and barkeeps. But this posthumous collection focuses on the relationship between analyst and analysand, and its goal is much more modest than that of some of his other books. Fromm is concerned here, it seems, not with building a better world but with building a better shrink. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Created by the iconoclastic Kiyohiko Azuma (hence the name), Azumanga Daioh is strongly character driven, telling the story of a group of high-school girls and their hilarious daily tribulations.</p><p>It's tough to tell the difference between teacher and students in Azuma's comedy. Teacher Yukari Tanizaki is oblivious, immature, emotional and one of the people shaping young minds. Her students face difficulties in school that most never imagined. For example, as one pupil starts to ask a question, Miss Yukari cuts him off, stating she won't talk about her bra size. Another group of students are ready for their lessons, but instead of learning about social studies or science, they learn how Miss Yukari spent her weekend. Maybe that's not so bad, considering Miss Yukari's not the brightest bulb in the bunch and has her students correcting her on many technical points. Her students aren't sure how to react, but their bewilderment is half the charm of this manga. Like the 1980s TV series Head of the Class, Azu has an eclectic mix of pupils ranging from child geniuses to sports enthusiasts to tough girls; each possessing much more than meets the eye. The precocious child genius may be great at academic subjects, but she still draws like a little girl and has the emotions of a kid. The unemotional tough teen melts for tiny animals and longs to have a pet of her own, even if all of the creatures she comes in contact with seem to hate her. The art is simple and minimalistic, but adequately conveys the thought and emotion behind each strip. Azuma's cast has depth, dimension and character, and their story heartily entertains. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Trinity term one week old. Implacable June weather. Fiona Maye, a High Court judge, at home on Sunday evening, supine on a chaise longue, staring past her stockinged feet toward the end of the room, toward a partial view of recessed bookshelves by the fireplace and, to one side, by a tall window, a tiny Renoir lithograph of a bather, bought by her thirty years ago for fifty pounds. Probably a fake. Below it, centered on a round walnut table, a blue vase. No memory of how she came by it. Nor when she last put flowers in it. The fireplace not lit in a year. Blackened raindrops falling irregularly into the grate with a ticking sound against balled-up yellowing newsprint. A Bokhara rug spread on wide polished floorboards. Looming at the edge of vision, a baby grand piano bearing silver-framed family photos on its deep black shine. On the floor by the chaise longue, within her reach, the draft of a judgment. And Fiona was on her back, wishing all this stuff at the bottom of the sea.<br><br>In her hand was her second Scotch and water. She was feeling shaky, still recovering from a bad moment with her husband. She rarely drank, but the Talisker and tap water was a balm, and she thought she might cross the room to the sideboard for a third. Less Scotch, more water, for she was in court tomorrow and she was duty judge now, available for any sudden demand, even as she lay recuperating. He had made a shocking declaration and placed an impossible burden on her. For the first time in years, she had actually shouted, and some faint echo still resounded in her ears. "You idiot! You fucking idiot!" She had not sworn out loud since her carefree teenage visits to Newcastle, though a potent word sometimes intruded on her thoughts when she heard self-serving evidence or an irrelevant point of law.<br><br>And then, not long after that, wheezy with outrage, she had said loudly, at least twice, "How dare you!"<br><br>It was hardly a question, but he answered it calmly. "I need it. I'm fifty-nine. This is my last shot. I've yet to hear evidence for an afterlife."<br><br>A pretentious remark, and she had been lost for a reply. She simply stared at him, and perhaps her mouth was open. In the spirit of the staircase, she had a response now, on the chaise longue. "Fifty-nine? Jack, you're sixty! It's pathetic, it's banal."<br><br>What she had actually said, lamely, was, "This is too ridiculous."<br><br>"Fiona, when did we last make love?"<br><br>When did they? He had asked this before, in moods plaintive to querulous. But the crowded recent past can be difficult to recall. The Family Division teemed with strange differences, special pleading, intimate half-truths, exotic accusation. And as in all branches of law, fine-grained particularities of circumstance needed to be assimilated at speed. Last week, she heard final submissions from divorcing Jewish parents, unequally Orthodox, disputing their daughters' education. The draft of her completed judgment was on the floor beside her. Tomorrow, coming before her again would be a despairing Englishwoman, gaunt, pale, highly educated, mother of a five-year-old girl, convinced, despite assurances to the court to the contrary, that her daughter was about to be removed from the jurisdiction by the father, a Moroccan businessman and strict Muslim, to a new life in Rabat, where he intended to settle. Otherwise, routine wrangles over residence of children, over houses, pensions, earnings, inheritance. It was the larger estates that came to the High Court. Wealth mostly failed to bring extended happiness. Parents soon learned the new vocabulary and patient procedures of the law, and were dazed to find themselves in vicious combat with the one they once loved. And waiting offstage, boys and girls first-named in the court documents, troubled little Bens and Sarahs, huddling together while the gods above them fought to the last, from the Family Proceedings Court, to the High Court, to the Court of Appeal.<br><br>All this sorrow had common themes, there was a human sameness to it, but it continued to fascinate her. She believed she brought reasonableness to hopeless situations. On the whole, she believed in the provisions of family law. In her optimistic moments she took it as a significant marker in civilization's progress to fix in the statutes the child's needs above its parents'. Her days were full, and in the evenings recently, various dinners, something at Middle Temple for a retiring colleague, a concert at Kings Place (Schubert, Scriabin), and taxis, Tube trains, dry-cleaning to collect, a letter to draft about a special school for the cleaning lady's autistic son, and finally sleep. Where was the sex? At that moment, she couldn't recall.<br><br>"I don't keep a record."<br><br>He spread his hands, resting his case.<br><br>She had watched as he crossed the room and poured himself a measure of Scotch, the Talisker she was drinking now. Lately, he was looking taller, easier in his movements. While his back was turned to her she had a cold premonition of rejection, of the humiliation of being left for a young woman, of being left behind, useless and alone. She wondered if she should simply go along with anything he wanted, then rejected the thought.<br><br>He had come back toward her with his glass. He wasn't offering her a Sancerre the way he usually did around this time.<br><br>"What do you want, Jack?"<br><br>"I'm going to have this affair."<br><br>"You want a divorce."<br><br>"No. I want everything the same. No deception."<br><br>"I don't understand."<br><br>"Yes you do. Didn't you once tell me that couples in long marriages aspire to the condition of siblings? We've arrived, Fiona. I've become your brother. It's cozy and sweet and I love you, but before I drop dead, I want one big passionate affair."<br><br>Mistaking her amazed gasp for laughter, for mockery perhaps, he said roughly, "Ecstasy, almost blacking out with the thrill of it. Remember that? I want one last go, even if you don't. Or perhaps you do."<br><br>She stared at him in disbelief.<br><br>"There it is, then."<br><br>This was when she had found her voice and told him what kind of idiot he was. She had a powerful grip on what was conventionally correct. That he had, as far as she knew, always been faithful made his proposition all the more outrageous. Or if he'd deceived her in the past he'd done it brilliantly. She already knew the name of the woman. Melanie. Not so remote from the name of a fatal form of skin cancer. She knew she could be obliterated by his affair with this twenty-eight-year-old statistician.<br><br>"If you do this it'll be the end for us. It's as simple as that."<br><br>"Is this a threat?"<br><br>"My solemn promise."<br><br>By then she had regained her temper. And it did seem simple. The moment to propose an open marriage was before the wedding, not thirty-five years later. To risk all they had so that he might relive a passing sensual thrill! When she tried to imagine wanting something like it for herself&#x2014;her "last fling" would be her first&#x2014;she could think only of disruption, assignations, disappointment, ill-timed phone calls. The sticky business of learning to be with someone new in bed, newly devised endearments, all the fakery. Finally, the necessary disentangling, the effort required to be open and sincere. And nothing quite the same when she came away. No, she preferred an imperfect existence, the one she had now.<br><br>But on the chaise longue it rose before her, the true extent of the insult, how he was prepared to pay for his pleasures with her misery. Ruthless. She had seen him single-minded at the expense of others, most often in a good cause. This was new. What had changed? He had stood erect, feet well apart as he poured his single malt, the fingers of his free hand moving to a tune in his head, some shared song perhaps, not shared with her. Hurting her and not caring&#x2014;that was new. He had always been kind, loyal and kind, and kindness, the Family Division daily proved, was the essential human ingredient. She had the power to remove a child from an unkind parent and she sometimes did. But remove herself from an unkind husband? When she was weak and desolate? Where was her protective judge?<br><br>Self-pity in others embarrassed her, and she wouldn't have it now. She was having a third drink instead. But she poured only a token measure, added much water and returned to her couch. Yes, it had been the kind of conversation of which she should have taken notes. Important to remember, to measure the insult carefully. When she threatened to end the marriage if he went ahead, he had simply repeated himself, told her again how he loved her, always would, that there was no other life but this, that his unmet sexual needs caused him great unhappiness, that there was this one chance and he wanted to take it with her knowledge and, so he hoped, her assent. He was speaking to her in the spirit of openness. He could have done it "behind her back." Her thin, unforgiving back.<br><br>"Oh," she murmured. "That's decent of you, Jack."<br><br>"Well, actually..." he said, and didn't finish.<br><br>She guessed he was about to tell her the affair had already begun and she couldn't bear to hear it. Didn't need to. She saw it. A pretty statistician working on the diminishing probability of a man returning to an embittered wife. She saw a sunlit morning, an unfamiliar bathroom, and Jack, still decently muscled, pulling a half-unbuttoned clean white linen shirt over his head in that impatient way he had, a discarded shirt tossed toward the laundry basket hanging by one arm before sliding to the floor. Perdition. It would happen, with or without her consent.<br><br>"The answer's no." She had used a rising tone, like a flinty schoolmarm. She added, "What else would you expect me to say?"<br><br>She felt helpless and wanted the conversation to end. There was a judgment to approve before tomorrow for publication in the Family Law Reports. The fates of two Jewish schoolgirls had already been settled in the ruling she had delivered in court, but the prose needed to be smoothed, as did the respect owed to piety in order to be proof against an appeal. Outside, summer rain beat against the windows; distantly, from beyond Gray's Inn Square, tires hissed on drenched asphalt. He would leave her and the world would go on.<br><br>His face had been tight as he shrugged and turned to leave the room. At the sight of his retreating back, she felt the same cold fear. She would have called after him but for the dread of being ignored. And what could she say? Hold me, kiss me, have the girl. She had listened to his footsteps down the hall, their bedroom door closing firmly, then silence settling over their flat, silence and the rain that hadn't stopped in a month.<br>First the facts. Both parties were from the tight folds of the strictly observant Haredi community in north London. The Bernsteins' marriage was arranged by their parents, with no expectation of dissent. Arranged, not forced, both parties, in rare accord, insisted. Thirteen years on, all agreed, mediator, social worker and judge included, that here was a marriage beyond repair. The couple were now separated. Between them they managed with difficulty the care of the two children, Rachel and Nora, who lived with the mother and had extensive contact with the father. Marriage breakdown had started in the early years. After the difficult birth of the second girl, the mother was unable to conceive again, due to radical surgery. The father had set his heart on a large family and thus began the painful unraveling. After a period of depression (prolonged, said the father; brief, said the mother), she studied at the Open University, gained a good qualification and entered on a career in teaching at primary level once the younger had started school. This arrangement did not suit the father or the many relatives. Within the Haredim, whose traditions were unbroken for centuries, women were expected to raise children, the more the better, and look after the home. A university degree and a job were highly unusual. A senior figure of good standing in the community was called as a witness by the father and said as much.<br><br>Men did not receive much education either. From their mid-teens, they were expected to give most of their time to studying the Torah. Generally, they did not go to university. Partly for this reason, many Haredim were of modest means. But not the Bernsteins, though they would be when their lawyers' bills were settled. A grandparent with a share in a patent for an olive-pitting machine had settled money on the couple jointly. They expected to spend everything they had on their respective silks, both women well known to the judge. On the surface, the dispute concerned Rachel and Nora's schooling. However, at stake was the entire context of the girls' growing up. It was a fight for their souls.<br><br>Haredi boys and girls were educated separately to preserve their purity. Modish clothes, television and the Internet were forbidden, and so was mixing with children who were allowed such distractions. Homes that did not observe strict kosher rules were out of bounds. Every aspect of daily existence was well covered by established customs. The problem had started with the mother, who was breaking with the community, though not with Judaism. Against the father's objections, she was already sending the girls to a coeducational Jewish secondary school where television, pop music, the Internet and mixing with non-Jewish children were permitted. She wanted her girls to stay on at school past the age of sixteen and to go to university if they wished. In her written evidence she said she wanted her daughters to know more about how others lived, to be socially tolerant, to have the career opportunities she never had, and as adults to be economically self-sufficient, with the chance of meeting the sort of husband with professional skills who could help to support a family. Unlike her husband, who gave all his time to studying, and teaching the Torah eight hours a week without pay.<br><br>For all the reasonableness of her case, Judith Bernstein&#x2014;angular pale face, uncovered frizzy ginger hair fastened with a huge blue clasp&#x2014;was not an easy presence in court. A constant passing forward with freckly agitated fingers of notes to her counsel, much muted sighing, eye-rolling and lip-pursing whenever her husband's counsel spoke, inappropriate rummaging and jiggling in an outsized camel leather handbag, removing from it at one low point in a long afternoon a pack of cigarettes and a lighter&#x2014;provocative items in her husband's scheme, surely&#x2014;and lining them up side by side, on hand for when the court rose.

On the contrary, Judith said from the stand, it was her parents-in-law who would not see her or the children until they had returned to the proper way of life, disowned the modern world, including&nbsp;social media, and until she kept a home that was kosher by their terms.<br><br>Mr. Julian Berns...</p><h2>Exploring Creation with Health and Nutrition, Textbook</h2><p>Apologia's newest curriculum, Exploring Creation with Health and Nutrition, covers what maturing students need to know to help them make the best choices they can for themselves as they become young adults.

Some celebrated, while many others questioned the choice.&nbsp; How could the world&#x2019;s most prestigious book prize be awarded to a famously cantankerous singer-songwriter who wouldn&#x2019;t even deign to attend the medal ceremony?</p><p>In Why Bob Dylan Matters, Harvard Professor Richard F. Thomas answers this question with magisterial erudition. A world expert on Classical poetry, Thomas was initially ridiculed by his colleagues for teaching a course on Bob Dylan alongside his traditional seminars on Homer, Virgil, and Ovid. Dylan&#x2019;s Nobel Prize brought him vindication, and he immediately found himself thrust into the spotlight as a leading academic voice in all matters Dylanological. Today, through his wildly popular Dylan seminar&#x2014;affectionately dubbed "Dylan 101"&#x2014;Thomas is introducing a new generation of fans and scholars to the revered bard&#x2019;s work. </p><p>This witty, personal volume is a distillation of Thomas&#x2019;s famous course, and makes a compelling case for moving Dylan out of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and into the pantheon of Classical poets. Asking us to reflect on the question, "What makes a classic?", Thomas offers an eloquent argument for Dylan&#x2019;s modern relevance, while interpreting and decoding Dylan&#x2019;s lyrics for readers. The most original and compelling volume on Dylan in decades, Why Bob Dylan Matters will illuminate Dylan&#x2019;s work for the Dylan neophyte and the seasoned fanatic alike. You&#x2019;ll never think about Bob Dylan in the same way again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Richard F. Thomas is George Martin Lane Professor of the Classics at Harvard University, a Bob Dylan expert, and the creator for a freshman seminar at Harvard on Bob Dylan.&#x201c;A highly informed, yet intimately personal celebration of one of our most important living writers.&#x201d; (<strong>NPR</strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;A nimble gloss on Dylan&#x2019;s lyric genius.&#x201d;<br> (<em>USA Today</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;A masterstroke of literary detective work . . . and an exciting examination of an artist&#x2019;s enigmatic mind.&#x201d; (<em>Booklist</em> (starred review))<br><br>&#x201c;Masterful, fun, passionate, learned, profound, and there&#x2019;s nothing like it. Thomas shows why Dylan deserves his Nobel&#x2014;and how he hearkens back to, and enlists, the classics. Fantastic reading, full of gems.&#x201d; (<strong>Cass R.

Clarke was born in Minehead in 1917. During the Second World War he served as a radar instructor for the RAF, rising to the rank of flight-lieutenant.

Living with his parents and his adored Uncle Amir in a house full of secrets, he is a bookish child, a dreamer haunted by night terrors. It is the 1970s and Zanzibar is changing. Tourists arrive, the island's white sands obscuring the memory of recent conflict--the longed-for independence from British colonialism swiftly followed by bloody revolution. When his father moves out, retreating into disheveled introspection, Salim is confused and ashamed. His mother does not discuss the change, nor does she explain her absences with a strange man; silence is layered on silence.</p><p> When glamorous Uncle Amir, now a senior diplomat, offers Salim an escape, the lonely teenager travels to London for college. But nothing has prepared him for the biting cold and seething crowds of this hostile city. Struggling to find a foothold, and to understand the darkness at the heart of his family, he must face devastating truths about those closest to him--and about love, sex, and power. Evoking the immigrant experience with unsentimental precision and profound understanding, <i>Gravel Heart</i> is a powerfully affecting story of isolation, identity, belonging, and betrayal, and Abdulrazak Gurnah's most astonishing achievement.</p></p><p><b>Abdulrazak Gurnah</b> was born in 1948 in Zanzibar and lives in England, where he teaches at the University of Kent. He is the author of seven novels, including <i>Paradise</i>, shortlisted for both the Booker and the Whitbread Prizes; <i>By the Sea</i>, longlisted for the Booker Prize and shortlisted for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; <i>Desertion</i>, shortlisted for the Commonwealth Prize; and <i>The Last Gift</i>.<p>"The measured elegance of Gurnah's prose renders his protagonist in a manner almost uncannily real . . . Gurnah's portrayal of student immigrant life in Britain is pleasingly deliberate and precise, and also riveting . . . Even the minor characters in this novel have richly imagined histories that inflect their smallest interactions--one of the loveliest pleasures of this book, and a choice that makes its world exceptionally full." -<i> New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"The elegance and control of Gurnah&#x2019;s writing, and his understanding of how quietly and slowly and repeatedly a heart can break, make this a deeply rewarding novel." - <i>Guardian</i></p><p>"A work of post-colonial literature that entertainingly intertwines migration and a tale of family drama . . . Gurnah has rightly been praised for his masterful storytelling . . . Gurnah hits upon an intriguing conflict: the post-colonial individual who becomes anglicised out of choice. It's a poignant moment when Salim realises he is becoming naturalised . . . Gurnah conveys Salim's shifting conception of his own nationality--a diminishing loyalty to the country of his birth--very well . . . An emotive tale about betrayal, families and the East African diaspora." -<i> Sunday Herald</i></p><p>"A colourful tale of life in a Zanzibar village, where passions and politics reshape a family . . . Expect echoes of Shakespeare's Measure For Measure, which provides the book's title, in two nights and 100 pages of powerful narrative." - <i>Mail on Sunday</i></p><p>"This well-crafted novel finds its protagonist suspended between two cultures, a part of each yet apart from both." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Gurnah finds a beautiful, quiet, contemplative tone in which to describe and reflect on Salim's experiences of displacement and discovery." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Booker Prize nominee Gurnah paints his characters and their surroundings vividly; the tumult of East Africa and the restless placidity of the UK are palpable. But his talent for restraint and lack of sentimentality may be the most salient traits of this tender coming-of-age tale, in which fascinating postcolonial textures echo the family drama." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Without sentimentality, the author imparts an affecting story of isolation, the search for identity, and loneliness at home, as well as in the large, hostile capital of a foreign nation where Salim is clearly not wanted . . . Compelling, drawing the reader directly into the life of young Salim and his pursuit of answers and understanding." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Gurnah's <i>Gravel Heart </i>is a book that may remind some readers of the author's Man Booker Prize finalist, Paradise. It circles around the falling of a society, herein Zanzibar, in the wake of colonial disruption. The protagonist, Salim, is caught in the midst of all this, and his slow spinning--internally and externally--revolves into a moving portraiture of a man caught in a web of things, hard and difficult. The structure of the book pays homage to William Shakespeare, and it may [be] this that solidifies Gurnah's sixth novel as an ambitious work worthy of attention." - <i>The Millions, "Most Anticipated"</i></p><p>"In the final, powerful section of <i>Gravel Heart</i>, Abdulrazak Gurnah&#x2019;s new novel, the narrator Salim travels to Zanzibar to visit his mother&#x2019;s grave and finally learn from his father what it was that destroyed their family many years previously. Salim has been living in England, studying literature, while his father has recently resumed life as a hermit in the back of a shop after several years in Kuala Lumpur. In a moving passage, Gurnah uses their conversation to highlight how disorientating it was for both the father and son to grow up bookish in Tanzania when most books represented a culture that vilified Muslims and Africans" - Tadzio Koelb, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>"What sets Gravel Heart apart from the many other books on the immigrant experience are Gurnah's deeper themes . . . G<i>ravel Heart</i> is much more than the story of a boy trying to uncover his family's secret. Ultimately, it's a story about trying find one's place in the world--and that's something we can all to relate to." - <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i></p><p>"Abdulrazak Gurnah is a captivating storyteller, with a voice both lyrical and mordant, and an oeuvre haunted by memory and loss." - <i>The Guardian on BY THE SEA</i></p><p>"Gurnah has some of the sharpness and clarity of VS Naipaul and more than a dash of Ben Okri's measured poetic diction." - <i>New Statesman on DESERTION</i></p><p>"Gurnah writes beautifully, with the satisfying assurance of someone who knows how to achieve his effects without undue fuss but with absolute precision." - <i>The Telegraph on DESERTION</i></p><p>"Gurnah&#x2019;s fluid, poetic prose contains striking turns of phrase . . . Fans of <i>Half the Sky</i> and <i>The Kite Runner</i> will appreciate the mixing of narratives in <i>The Last Gift</i> as the various perspectives blend to create a truly powerful novel." - <i>Booklist on THE LAST GIFT</i></p></p><h2>Tales from Shakespeare (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Celebrated prose retellings of Shakespeare's plays</b> <br><br> Charles and Mary Lamb have delighted generations of adults as well as children with their famed prose renderings of Shakespeare's originals.

Every Latino man who drove away from their shared apartment above a small auto repair shop that day had failed to return&#x2015;arrested, one by one, by ICE agents and local police. As the two women discussed what to do next, a SWAT team clad in body armor and carrying assault rifles stormed the room. As Guadalupe remembers it, "The soldiers came in the house. They knocked down doors. They threw gas. They had guns. We were two women with small children... The kids terrified, the kids screaming."</p><p>In <i>Separated</i>, William D. Lopez examines the lasting damage done by this daylong act of collaborative immigration enforcement in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Exploring the chaos of enforcement through the lens of community health, Lopez discusses deportation's rippling negative effects on families, communities, and individuals. Focusing on those left behind, Lopez reveals their efforts to cope with trauma, avoid homelessness, handle worsening health, and keep their families together as they attempt to deal with a deportation machine that is militarized, traumatic, implicitly racist, and profoundly violent. </p><p>Lopez uses this single home raid to show what immigration law enforcement looks like from the perspective of the people who actually experience it. Drawing on in-depth interviews with twenty-four individuals whose lives were changed that day in 2013, as well as field notes, records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and his own experience as an activist, Lopez combines rigorous research with narrative storytelling. Putting faces and names to the numbers behind deportation statistics, <i>Separated</i> urges readers to move beyond sound bites and consider the human experience of mixed-status communities in the small everyday towns that dot the interior of the United States.</p></p><p><p>William D.

While the food and chemical industries claim that GMO food is safe, a considerable amount of evidence shows otherwise. In <em>Seeds of Deception</em>, Jeffrey Smith, a former executive with the leading independent laboratory testing for GM presence in foods, documents these serious health dangers and explains how corporate influence and government collusion have been used to cover them up.</p> <p>The stories Smith presents read like a mystery novel. Scientists are offered bribes or threatened; evidence is stolen; data withheld or distorted. Government scientists who complain are stripped of responsibilities or fired. The FDA even withheld information from congress after a GM food supplement killed nearly a hundred people and permanently disabled thousands. While Smith was employed by the laboratory he was not allowed to speak on the health dangers or the cover-up. No longer bound by this agreement, Smith now reveals what he knows in this groundbreaking expos�.</p> <p>Today, food companies sell GM foods that have not undergone safety studies. FDA scientists opposed this, but White House and industry pressure prevailed and the agency's final policy--co-authored by a former Monsanto attorney--denied the risks. The scientists' concerns were made public only after a lawsuit forced the agency to turn over internal documents.</p> <p>Dan Glickman, former Secretary of Agriculture, describes the government's pro-biotech mindset: "You felt like you were almost an alien, disloyal, by trying to present an open-minded view. . . . So I pretty much spouted the rhetoric. . . . It was written into my speeches."</p> <p>In <em>Seeds of Deception</em> Smith offers easy-to-understand descriptions of genetic engineering and explains why it can result in serious health problems. This well-documented, pivotal work will show you how to protect yourself and your family.</p></p><p><p>International bestselling author of <em>Seeds of Deception</em> and <em>Genetic Roulette</em>, Jeffrey M. Smith is a widely popular spokesperson on the documented health risks of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and how biotech companies rig research, gag critics, hijack regulators, and spin fantastic unfulfilled promises. His Institute for Responsible Technology's Campaign for Healthier Eating in America is designed to achieve the tipping point of consumer rejection of GMOs to force them out of the food supply. The campaign encourages public and private showings of the Monsanto film and offers support material at www.ResponsibleTechnology.org. He lives in Fairfield, Iowa.

Are genetically modified foods safe? Longtime anti-GM foods campaigner Smith presents the "opposing" case. He offers cases where GM produced results that were at best unexpected (increased starch content in potatoes), at worst grotesque (pigs without genitals). He describes how one corporation reportedly tried to bribe Canadian government scientists into approving genetically engineered bovine growth hormones they deemed unsafe; how some scientists have reported their careers were threatened as a result of their refusal to approve certain GM products in the U.S.; and how "conflicts of interest, sloppy science, and industry influence" can distort the approval process. The cases Smith presents are scary and timely, but he explores only one side of the story. Readers looking for a balance consideration of genetically modified foods will want to look elsewhere.<em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</em></p><br><br><p>"Jeffrey Smith masterfully combines the art of storytelling and investigative reporting.

Now, for the fist time, we have a comprehensive, objective, and deeply researched account of the brigade's experience in Spain and what happened to the survivors when they returned to the United States. (About one-third of the volunteers died in Spain). The book is largely based on previously unused sources, including the newly opened Russian archives, and more than 100 oral histories. The author charts the volunteers' motivations for enlisting in the fight against Spanish fascism and places their actions in the context of the Depression era. The battleground experiences of the brigade have never before been depicted in such vivid detail, and such battles as Jarama, Belchite, and the Ebro come alive in the participants' words. The author uses the military aspects of the war to illuminate such related issues as the influence of political ideology on military events and the psychology of a volunteer army. He also closely examines the role of the Communist party in the conduct of the war, including the "Orwell question"&#x2015;allegations of a Communist reign of terror in Spain&#x2015;and investigates the alleged racial problems within the brigade, the first fully integrated military unit in American history. The book continues the saga of the brigade by relating the problems of the surviving volunteers with the U.S. Army during World War II; their opposition to the Cold War, the Vietnam war, and U.S. intervention in Central America; the persecution during the Red Scare of the 1950s; and their involvement with the civil rights movement.</p><p>&#x201c;Peter Carroll has written with great skill and understanding the fifty-year story of the Americans who fought in the Spanish civil war. Never has the complicated and intriguing tale been told so fully, drawing as it does not only from survivors who can recount their experiences, but also from a wealth of original material, including the just-opened archives in Moscow. What is particularly fascinating is the account of the tribulations and triumphs of the veterans in the years after they were &#x2018;premature anti-fascists.&#x2019; This is the moment for this book to appear, and one is grateful that it has been done so well.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter Stansky, Stanford University<br>&#x201c;This rare, this astonishing book&#x2014;rich, authoritative, and moving as it is on its central subject&#x2014;through Peter Carroll&#x2019;s way of chronicling becomes something even greater: an urgently contemporary touchstone that helps us discern in our time similar contending forces in moral, not political terms&#x2014;good against evil, might against right, means against ends. In a vivid, pulsing narrative, Carroll encompasses the historical context, the drama of men in battle, and most of all the haunting human beings themselves. But what can be found nowhere else is his account of the succeeding fifty years of those who survived, as they stubbornly clung to their beliefs in the necessity of action and the possibility of transformative social change.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tillie OlsenPeter N.

With a fire crackling on the hearth, a good supper just dispatched, and an interesting tome borrowed from the Oreska House library open on his lap, Alec was looking forward to a peaceful evening. His companion, however, had other ideas.<br><br>Sprawled in a pile of cushions in front of the fire, Seregil had thumbed through a succession of apparently uninteresting letters, discarded several books, and now lay staring up at the ceiling and whistling a sad tune softly--and rather annoyingly--through his teeth. Alec guessed he was composing some new song, as he maddeningly kept repeating phrases and tapping time against the ash shovel with one bare foot. Even Ruetha and her kittens had lost patience with him and had retreated to their basket in the corner.<br><br>But as distracting as it was, and as melancholy as the tune sounded, Alec felt a certain amount of relief, too. It had been difficult for both of them, losing more people they cared about--Myrhichia, Lady Kylith, Duke Malthus--the previous year. They'd nearly lost Micum Cavish's daughter Illia, as well. Alec had felt the losses deeply, but Seregil was always one to hang on to pain, tinged as it was with guilt.<br><br>This was the first time Seregil had shown any interest in composing in months, so the interruption was almost welcome, even if it did mean Alec wasn't going to get any reading done.<br><br>He closed his book. "That's a pretty tune you're working on. Play it for me?"<br><br>Seregil glanced up at the Aurenfaie harp hanging on the wall. "It's not done yet."<br><br>"So play me what you have."<br><br>Seregil cast him a sidelong glance. "I'm annoying you."<br><br>"Just a little."<br><br>With an apologetic half smile, Seregil marshaled his long limbs and resurrected himself from his nest. Taking the harp down, he plucked at the strings, tuned them a little, then played a few bars of what sounded like a lament.<br><br>The melancholy tune together with Seregil's overall restlessness were familiar weather signs. Hoping to lighten his lover's mood, Alec said, "You know, you once promised me you'd never say it again."<br><br>"I haven't said a thing in the past hour," Seregil said, brows arching over sea-grey eyes.<br><br>Alec snorted softly. "And we haven't accepted a nightrunner job in nearly a month."<br><br>"There haven't been any worth our time. They're all so--" Seregil threw up his hands in exasperation.<br><br>"Go on, then. Just say it."<br><br>"Boring!" Seregil hung the harp back on its hook and faced Alec with his hands on his hips. "If I have to deliver one more love token or look for any more compromising letters, I'm going to hang myself!"<br><br>"We spend time at court."<br><br>"Yes, we do--and as much as I care for our young queen, I've made about as much polite chitchat as I'm capable of."<br><br>Alec couldn't argue that point. It had been a long, hard winter, burying Rhiminee in treacherous slush and ice that had curtailed riding and outdoor shooting; the last hunt had been just after Mourning Night.<br><br>They were relative newcomers in the royal inner circle, and favorites of Queen Elani despite their lowly rank, so naturally they were despised by a good many of the more established members of the entourage. Seregil won so consistently at the bakshi table, and Alec so consistently defeated other would-be archers--soft-handed nobles who'd never had to shoot true or else starve--that few would take them on anymore. Some had taken to calling them the queen's lapdogs behind their backs.<br><br>Their detractors might have had a great deal more to say if they could see them now, lounging in their hidden rooms at the Stag and Otter in decidedly unfashionable Blue Fish Street behind the Harvest Market. Seregil secretly owned the place, and it was their true home and refuge from the endless round of social obligations their public reputations demanded: entertaining at the Wheel Street villa, attending salons of their remaining friends, evenings at the Oreska House with Thero and Magyana, the requisite keeping up with the latest fashions via their tailors and jewelers. With the end of the war a year and a half earlier, luxuries were once more abundant and the black-market dealers were going hungry. Many people still decried the state of theater, since Master Atre and his marvelous company had abruptly disappeared near the war's end. The Golden Crane stood empty, but the other companies around the city were still suffering by comparison.<br><br>"Well, what do you want to do?" asked Alec.<br><br>"Get out of the damn city!"<br><br>"Then let's go out to Watermead. We haven't seen Micum and the family in ages."<br><br>Seregil looked out at the rain, and his thin lips tilted into a doubtful line. It would be a wet, cold ride, and he avoided being wet and cold as much as possible. "Maybe in a few days, if the weather breaks. Anyway, we're due back at Wheel Street in time to appear for Korathan's birthday."<br><br>He threw a few logs onto the fire and subsided back among the cushions with one of his scattered books.<br><br>Peace at last, thought Alec, returning to his own book--until Seregil started whistling again.<br>Chapter 2<br><br>A Timely Offer<br><br>They returned to Wheel Street and public life a few days later, attending the prince's birthday gala, and the social whirl began again. The foul weather continued--with sullen rain giving way to dank fog. They went to the theater, to gambling houses, and to a few salons, including that of Marquise Alania, a fashionable dowager who'd taken quite an interest in them since Seregil's risque display at the Three Dragons nearly a year ago. To her credit, her circle was an interesting collection of well-educated nobles, philosophers, artists, and amusing ne'er-do-wells like Seregil. The food and wine were always exquisite. Even Seregil had to grudgingly admit that life was a bit less tedious than it had been.<br><br>The weather improved at last, rain giving way to bright sunshine and brisk winds. They were at Alania's house one night during the Festival of Flowers when Alec noticed Seregil blinking and rubbing absently at his left temple as he lost a bakshi game to the court painter, Vireus. Finishing his game of Blue Goose with Alania and two flirtatious young noblewomen, Alec laid his cards aside and went to sit by Seregil.<br><br>"What's wrong?" he murmured as Seregil conceded the game.<br><br>"Headache," Seregil replied. "I'm afraid I'm going to have to make an early night of it."<br><br>"I'm so sorry to hear it," said the marquise, coming to join them. "I can have Evers prepare you a willow bark tea."<br><br>"That's very kind of you, but I think a good night's sleep is in order." Seregil bent over her hand and kissed it gallantly. "I promise you a fine dinner at Wheel Street to make up for this."<br><br>The wind had blown out many of the street lanterns, and those few left cast uncertain shadows at the edges of the street. It was a good night for footpads, even in this fashionable district of guards and walls, but Seregil seemed unusually distracted, often raising a gloved hand to his brow as he rode.<br><br>"You're in real pain."<br><br>"Must be the change in the weather."<br><br>As soon as they got home Seregil went to bed with a cup of willow bark infusion. When Alec came to bed later, he was asleep but restless. Alec touched Seregil's brow and was relieved to find it cool. He didn't wake when Alec blew out the night lamp and climbed into bed to pull him close. That seemed to calm him, and Alec soon drifted off.<br><br>A buffeting wind yanked persistently on his cloak and whipped his hair across his eyes as Seregil bent to inspect the lock on the huge oak door. The moon was high, casting enough light to see the rusted plate and enormous keyhole. Nothing in his tool roll was large enough to pick the lock. Surrounded by lichen-blotched stone, the door stood between him and Alec, and he had to get to Alec. The thought made his head and his heart pound painfully: must find Alec!<br><br>Thrusting his hand into the keyhole, he felt for the tumblers. They were razor-sharp, cutting the sensitive pads of his fingertips, but he could not stop. The pain was unbearable, but at last he felt the lock give. Withdrawing his bloodied hand, he swung the door open and found himself in a long corridor.<br><br>"Alec!" His voice came out strangled, barely audible. He tried again but could only force out a hoarse whisper.<br><br>As he started down the corridor, however, he heard his name called from a great distance that had nothing to do with stone walls. The corridor was long, and at the far end stood Alec, facing away from him.<br><br>"Alec!" Seregil croaked, knowing there was no way that Alec would hear.<br><br>As he'd feared, Alec disappeared around a corner to the right. Seregil ran to the turning, only to find another equally long corridor and, once again, Alec with his back to him. He called out, but Alec disappeared again--to the left this time. It happened again and again, as if they were playing some strange and frustrating game not of Seregil's choosing.<br><br>Rounding a final turn, he could see Alec crouched against the wall that dead-ended at the far end of the hallway. He had his face in his hands but Seregil knew him by his blond braid and his clothing. When his lover looked up, his once beautiful face was nothing but an empty-eyed skull. Suddenly a door opened behind him and Alec fell through it. The door disappeared as suddenly as it had come.<br><br>"No!" Seregil screamed. "Alec! Tali, come--"<br><br>"--back!"<br><br>The desperation in Seregil's voice jolted Alec awake in time to catch something hard and blunt in the face. With a grunt of pain and surprise, he automatically reached out to fend off an attacker, but instead felt Seregil sitting bolt upright in bed, trembling and covered in cold sweat. His voice was ragged and eerie as he whispered over and over, "Come back! Please come back!"<br><br>"It's all right, tali." Alec gently pulled him back down, settling with Seregil's head on his shoulder. It was too dark to see him, but Alec could feel his lover's heart hammering against his ribs, and the clamminess of his skin. Seregil was no stranger to nightmares, but it had been ages since he'd had one like this. "What was it?"<br><br>"A bad one."<br><br>"What about?"<br><br>"I--I can't remember."<br><br>"You talked in your sleep. You were begging someone to come back."<br><br>"Really?" Seregil drew a shuddering breath. "I don't know. I can't remember anything except being terrified."<br><br>"Maybe you will in the morning. How's the headache?"<br><br>"Still bad."<br><br>"I'll get you something." But when he tried to leave the bed, Seregil's arms tightened around him.<br><br>"Please, stay."<br><br>Alec pulled the sheet up to Seregil's chin and rubbed his back, as he had so many nights after Nysander's tragic death. It was a long time until he was certain Seregil was asleep.<br><br>The following morning they woke late. Seregil looked positively haggard.<br><br>"Does your head still hurt?" Alec asked.<br><br>"No, thankfully, but I don't think I slept well." Seregil rubbed at his eyes, then frowned up at him. "Bilairy's Balls, what happened to your face?"<br><br>"You did, tali. You thrashed around while you were dreaming." Alec went to the tall looking glass and ruefully examined the small bruise under his right cheekbone. "You're a hazard to sleep with sometimes."<br><br>Seregil came over and gently kissed the bruise. "I'm sorry."<br><br>"Maybe it was just the rich food last night. Alania's cook uses too much spice and butter."<br><br>"That's probably it," Seregil said with a chuckle, but it sounded a bit hollow, for they both remembered a time when his nightmares had been more than mere dreams.<br><br>Late-morning sunlight streamed in through the dining room doors. In the garden beyond, the crocuses had already vanished and jonquils and fragrant hyacinth were in bloom under the budding lilacs. Fresh green leaves adorned the rosebushes. Seregil and Alec were lingering over a late breakfast when Runcer ushered in Thero and his young apprentice, Mika.<br><br>Ten years old now, the sandy-haired boy had grown half a hand span since Thero had rescued him from the sleeping death. Bright and inquisitive, and a bit mischievous at times, Mika was utterly devoted to Thero. His wide grey eyes shone with pride and adoration at every approving word.<br><br>Runcer went off to the kitchen to fetch extra dishes and milk for Mika.<br><br>"What brings you two out so early?" asked Alec, pouring a mug of strong Aurenen tea for Thero.<br><br>"Early?" Thero scoffed. "It's nearly noon and you're still in your dressing gown. Did Alania keep you two out all night again?"<br><br>"No, we finished early, as it happens," said Alec.<br><br>"I like her," Mika informed them, reaching for a spiced bun. "She kisses me, but she gives me sweets, too."<br><br>Thero moved the buns out of reach without touching the plate. "Manners!"<br><br>The wizard's relationship with the boy was that of a teacher, mentor, and guardian since Mika had moved from his parents' house to Thero's tower rooms at the Oreska House. Despite being a rather strict disciplinarian, Thero clearly cared deeply for his apprentice, and Seregil continued to marvel at the transformation of the man--once rival, and now valued friend. The "cold fish" of old had matured into a reasonable human being, concerned with more than just his prowess with magic and thirst for knowledge.<br><br>Mika did his best to look contrite. "May I have a bun, please, Lord Alec?"<br><br>Alec grinned and nudged the plate back within reach. "Have as many as you like."<br><br>While the adults chatted about various social doings, Mika ate his fill of buns and bacon, managing to slip a few morsels to the pair of white Zengati hounds lurking under the table when he thought no one was looking. When the meal was over, Thero suggested the boy take the dogs into the garden.<br><br>Seregil whistled Zir and Marag out from under the table and found a well-gnawed wooden ball for Mika to throw for them. When he was gone, Seregil gave the wizard a questioning look.<br><br>"You look uncommonly tired, Seregil," Thero noted. "Don't tell me your roistering life is starting to catch up with you?"<br><br>"I didn't sleep well."<br><br>"He had a nightmare," Alec added, earning himself an annoyed look from Seregil.<br><br>"I'm sorry to hear that," said Thero. "You used to have them quite often, as I recall."<br><br>"Everyone has one now and then," said Seregil, brushing it aside. "So, what brings you here?"<br><br>Thero helped himself to more tea. "What's your opinion on ghosts?"<br><br>"I'm not fond of them." Seregil took a sip of tea and glanced at Alec. There were only three things Seregil knew of that the younger man actually feared: losing Seregil, heights, and--since feeling their cold touch the day Alec had killed the dyrmagnos on a distant Plenimaran shore--ghosts.

They were arrested by a small group of citizens a few miles from the Belgian border and forced to return to Paris. Two years later they would both die at the guillotine. It is this extraordinary story, and the events leading up to and away from it, that Tackett recounts in gripping novelistic style.</p><p>The king's flight opens a window to the whole of French society during the Revolution. Each dramatic chapter spotlights a different segment of the population, from the king and queen as they plotted and executed their flight, to the people of Varennes who apprehended the royal family, to the radicals of Paris who urged an end to monarchy, to the leaders of the National Assembly struggling to control a spiraling crisis, to the ordinary citizens stunned by their king's desertion. Tackett shows how Louis's flight reshaped popular attitudes toward kingship, intensified fears of invasion and conspiracy, and helped pave the way for the Reign of Terror.</p><p>Tackett brings to life an array of unique characters as they struggle to confront the monumental transformations set in motion in 1789. In so doing, he offers an important new interpretation of the Revolution. By emphasizing the unpredictable and contingent character of this story, he underscores the power of a single event to change irrevocably the course of the French Revolution, and consequently the history of the world.</p></p><p>This captivating account brings to life one of history&#39;s most decisive turning points. Tackett has produced that rare combination of history that reads like a novel yet deepens our understanding of a crucial moment. Only a true master of his subject and a great writer could pull off this feat.Timothy Tackett is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of California, Irvine.</p><h2>A Primer on Postmodernism</h2><p>From the academy to pop culture, our society is in the throes of change rivaling the birth of modernity out of the decay of the Middle Ages.

Now this extraordinarily gifted novelist returns to the story of Beauty and the Beast with a fresh perspective, ingenuity, and mature insight. <p>With <b>Rose Daughter</b>, she presents her finest and most deeply felt work--a compelling, richly imagined, and haunting exploration of the transformative power of love.</p></p><p>Robin McKinley has won various awards and citations for her writing, including the Newbery Medal for <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>The Blue Sword</i>. Her other books include <i>Sunshine</i>; the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Spindle's End</i>; two novel-length retellings of the fairy tale <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>Beauty and Rose Daughter</i>; and a retelling of the <i>Robin Hood</i> legend, <i>The Outlaws of Sherwood</i>. She lives with her husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson.<p></p>Gr. 6^-12. Almost 20 years after her well-received, award-winning <i>Beauty</i> (1978), McKinley reexplores and reexpands on the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. This is not a sequel, but a new novelization that is fuller bodied, with richer characterizations and a more mystical, darker edge. Although the Library of Congress catalogs it in the 398s, the book really belongs on the fiction shelves alongside <i>Beauty</i>. The familiar plot is here, but the slant is quite different, though Beauty's sisters are once again loving rather than hostile as in de Beaumont's original version. A few scenes are reminiscent of <i>Beauty</i>. For example, in the dining room scenes in the castle, Beauty eats but the Beast merely is present: "I am a Beast; I cannot eat like a man." In <i>Rose Daughter</i>, Beauty has an affinity for flower gardening, particularly roses, because of her memories of her deceased mother; it is a talent that serves her in good stead as she nurtures the Beast's dying rose garden. Also, in some nicely done foreshadowing, Beauty suffers from recurring dreams of a long, dark corridor and something--a monster?--waiting for her at the end. Rose Cottage, where Beauty and her family settle after the father's financial downfall, and the nearby town and its residents, as well as the opulence of the Beast's castle and the devastation of his rose garden, are vividly depicted. Among the fantasy elements are a prescient cat, the spirit of the greenwitch who willed Rose Cottage to Beauty's family, unicorns, and preternatural Guardians. There is more background on the Beast in this version, allowing readers to see how he came to be bewitched, and Beauty's choice at the end, a departure from that in <i>Beauty</i>, is just so right. Readers will be enchanted, in the best sense of the word. <i>Sally Estes</i></p><h2>Night In The Lonesome October</h2><p>All is not what it seems. In the murky London gloom, a knife-wielding gentleman named Jack prowls the midnight streets with his faithful watchdog Snuff - gathering together the grisly ingredients they will need for an upcoming ancient and unearthly rite. For soon after the death of the moon, black magic will summon the Elder Gods back into the world. And all manner of Players, both human and undead, are preparing to participate. Some have come to open the gates. Some have come to slam them shut. And now the dread night approaches - so let the Game begin.</p><p>Roger Zelazny HUGO &amp; NEBULA AWARD-WINNING author Roger burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for Lord of Light, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular Amber series, Nine Princes in Amber. In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career.Leaving his ever-popular and ever-expanding Amber series behind for the nonce, Zelazny delivers a cheerful, witty, well-crafted fantasy narrated by Snuff, dog-companion to Jack the Ripper. It seems that Jack is in fact a sorcerer and his gruesome exploits were perpetrated in the service of his magic. But the Ripper's killings are tangential to the tale of an upcoming struggle between magical personages. In a rare occurrence, the cosmic forces are in alignment, permitting an opening for the Elder Gods to return to Earth. Openers are contending with Closers, who want to keep the Elder Gods shut out. Snuff recounts the day-by-day preparations as players size up the competition, gather their magical arsenals and make and break alliances. Snuff himself maneuvers among other familiars (a cat named Graymalk, a snake called Quicklime, etc.). An instantly recognizable gothic compliment of characters includes a mad doctor trying to reanimate a patchwork corpse with lightning, a werewolf named Larry Talbot and a Great Detective; who haunts the sidelines. Zelazny handles this material with a charm few can match, and while this novel does not approach the depth of his best work like Lord of Light, its deft, understated good humor and spare, poetic prose reaffirm Zelazny as one of fantasy's most skilled practitioners. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>Zelazny bursts forth with, well, Victorian light supernatural fantasy just about covers it.

Her father's favorite and adored by her new husband, Eliezer, Rachel's life looks to be one of peaceful scholarship, laughter, and love. But events beyond her control will soon threaten everything she holds dear. Marauders of the First Crusade massacre nearly the entire Jewish population of Germany, and her beloved father suffers a stroke. Eliezer wants their family to move to the safety of Spain, but Rachel is determined to stay in France and help her family save the Troyes yeshiva, the only remnant of the great centers of Jewish learning in Europe. <br><br> As she did so effectively in <i>Joheved</i> and <i>Miriam</i>, Maggie Anton vividly brings to life the world of eleventh-century France and a remarkable Jewish woman of dignity, passion, and strength.</p><p><b>Maggie Anton</b>&nbsp;was born Margaret Antonofsky in Los Angeles, California. Raised in a secular, socialist household, she reached adulthood with little knowledge of her Jewish religion. All that changed when David Parkhurst, who was to become her husband, entered her life, and they both discovered Judaism as adults. In the early 1990's, Anton began studying Talmud in a class for women taught by Rachel Adler, now a professor at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles. She became intrigued with the idea that Rashi, one of the greatest Jewish scholars ever, had no sons, only three daughters. Slowly but surely, she began to research the family and the time in which they lived. Legend has it that Rashi's daughters were learned in a time when women were traditionally forbidden to study the sacred texts. These forgotten women seemed ripe for rediscovery, and the idea of a book about them was born.&#x201c;Anton delivers a tour de force . . .

There wasn&#x2019;t anybody meaner in the whole town of Pine Level, she thought. Maybe in all of Alabama. Why was he always picking on her? She walked on, faster now, holding herself tall. Inside her head, she said Bible verses for strength.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uppity, ain&#x2019;t ya?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rosa kept her eyes ahead. Sylvester was crowding near to her, his arm brushing the skirt of her dress. He stumbled as he tried to make his short legs keep up with hers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Slow down some,&#x201d; he whimpered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run, little nigger!&#x201d; Franklin shouted. He didn&#x2019;t have to yell it. The hate word slammed into Rosa&#x2019;s mind and burned in her gut.<br> <br>Beside Rosa, Sylvester tripped. His knee hit an old brick on the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; he yelped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, baby fall down.&#x201d; Franklin laughed cruelly. &#x201c;Do he want another boo-boo?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rosa whipped around, her dark eyes flashing. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare touch my brother!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, ho. Now who&#x2019;s talking proud! I just want to help.&#x201d; But the look on Franklin&#x2019;s face meant more trouble. He made a fist and took a step toward them. Before she could think, Rosa picked up the brick that had tripped her brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave us be!&#x201d; she yelled, and brought the brick up by her head, ready to throw. Rosa was trembling all through with anger. Franklin wasn&#x2019;t going to get away with it&#x2014;not today. &#x201c;Go home!&#x201d; she snarled.<br> <br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t hurt me with that ol&#x2019; brick,&#x201d; Franklin said. His words were brave, but his pale eyes were wide with surprise. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a girl.&#x201d; He was stalling, Rosa could tell. &#x201c;And,&#x201d; he said, his voice getting louder, &#x201c;a scrawny nigger girl at that.&#x201d;<br> <br>The word dug into her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I been pickin&#x2019; cotton all fall,&#x201d; Rosa said, &#x201c;I may be little, but my arm&#x2019;s as strong as your&#x2019;s has ever been!&#x201d; She pulled the brick back as if to throw it into his face.<br> <br>She watched Franklin&#x2019;s eyes narrow as he looked at her arm. Rosa held her breath. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t going to get into it with no ten-year-old,&#x201d; Franklin told her. He took a step back and looked quickly around him.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s looking for help, Rosa thought. She forced herself not to smile. She knew she was small for her age. And she was black, too. But she had threatened Franklin. And he was backing off! Rosa stood as tall as she ever had in her life. She felt Sylvester&#x2019;s hand grab hers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t be fair to fight a girl, nohow,&#x201d; Franklin said. Rosa knew he was just saying it to make himself feel better. He backed down the road, his eyes never leaving the brick in her hand. &#x201c;You just watch yourself,&#x201d; he threatened. Finally, he turned and stalked away.<br> <br>A mockingbird sang in the silence. Rosa let herself grin. She reached down and hugged Sylvester tight. &#x201c;Time we be going home,&#x201d; she told him, brushing off his dusty coveralls. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait till Mama hears what I did to Big Bad Franklin.&#x201d;<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean to tell me that you stood right up to that white boy?&#x201d; Mrs. McCauley&#x2019;s hands were on her hips, her face set and hard. The cackling of chickens floated through the open door of their little farmhouse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, I did.&#x201d; Rosa grinned at her mother. She set her school papers on the table and went on. &#x201c;He made a fist like he would hit me, so I picked up a brick. I even made like I might hit him.&#x201d; The look on her mother&#x2019;s face stopped her. Rosa bit her lip.</p><h2>Handbook for the Spirit</h2><p>In <i>Handbook for the Spirit,</i> an extraordinary group of thinkers and teachers, including Andrew Harvey, Sue Bender, Rev. Michael Beckwith, Barbara De Angelis, and Marianne Williamson, celebrate their personal experiences of the divine. Previously published as <i>For the Love of God</i>, the book features the Dalai Lama on the central importance of kindness; Sue Bender on the small miracles of everyday life; Brooke Medicine Eagle on the Great Spirit; and Joseph Goldstein on the Dharma. Included are Rabbi Harold Kushner on how God appears in relationships, Brother David Steindl-Rast on perceiving the divine through the senses, and 19 other contributors. Each author shares what it is like to have a personal relationship with a higher spirit, how this relationship developed, and how it manifests in his or her life, relationships, and career. Most significantly, the authors offer insight into how readers can enhance their connections with a higher source. <i>Handbook for the Spirit </i>offers both hope and purpose in a world deeply in need of both.</p><p>&#34;To me, the key to spiritual growth and God-consciousness is understanding that we&#39;re not in this world to look for a new belief system,&#34; writes Reverend Michael Beckwith, a contributor to this outstanding selection of essays on personal relationships with the divine. &#34;Instead, we are looking for ways to awaken to our real self.&#34; Beckwith&#39;s wisdom speaks to the core purpose of this superbly edited book. Diverse poetic and inspirational voices, such as Rabbi Harold Kushner, Mother Teresa, Hugh Prather, Brooke Medicine Eagle, and the Dalai Lama create a surprisingly harmonious message--one that sings the praises of finding and worshipping a God in one&#39;s self and one&#39;s life."This collection of essays has something for nearly every reader." - <i>Booklist</i><p>"Highly recommended." - <i>Library Journal</i></p>"Perhaps only once in a lifetime does a book come along with such profound spiritual insights." - <i>Leading Edge Review</i></p><h2>Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics, The Essentials</h2><p><p><strong>Keeping the Republic </strong>gives students the <strong>power</strong> to</p> <ul> <li><strong>examine</strong> the narrative of what&#x2032;s going on in American politics,&nbsp; </li> <li><strong>distinguish</strong> fact from fiction and balance from bias, and&nbsp; </li> <li><strong>influence</strong> the message through informed citizenship.&nbsp; </li> </ul> <p><strong>Keeping the Republic </strong>draws students into the study of American politics, showing them how to think critically about "who gets what, and how" while exploring the twin themes of power and citizenship.

Author: James W. Stoutenborough,</p><h2>From Novice to Expert: Excellence and Power in Clinical Nursing Practice, Commemorative Edition</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This coherent presentation of clinical judgement, caring practices and collaborative practice provides ideas and images that readers can draw upon in their interactions with others and in their interpretation of what nurses do. It includes many clear, colorful examples and describes the five stages of skill acquisition, the nature of clinical judgement and experiential learning and the seven major domains of nursing practice. The narrative method captures content and contextual issues that are often missed by formal models of nursing knowledge. <b> </b> The book uncovers the knowledge embedded in clinical nursing practice and provides the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition applied to nursing, an interpretive approach to identifying and describing clinical knowledge, nursing functions, effective management, research and clinical practice, career development and education, plus practical applications. <b> </b> For nurses and healthcare professionals. </p></p><p><p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> This book is based on a dialogue with nurses and nursing, descriptive research that identified five levels of competency in clinical nursing practice. These levels &#x2014; novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert &#x2014; are described in the words of nurses who were interviewed and observed either individually or in small groups. Only patient care situations where the nurse made a positive difference in the patient's outcome are included. These situations offer vivid examples of excellence in actual nursing practice. They are not abstract ideals, however; they emerge from the imperfections and contingencies with which nurses work daily. </p> <p><b>A Note to the Skeptics</b></p> <p> Some who read the exemplars will be skeptical that such nursing is possible. Their skepticism is warranted, because these examples are drawn from outstanding clinical situations where the nurse learned something about her practice or made a significant contribution to a patient's welfare. But if the reader's skepticism stems from a generalized disillusionment with nursing in hospitals and from the belief that nurses are rendered impotent to give compassionate, lifesaving care in hospitals &#x2014; then this book offers a resounding rebuttal to the skeptic and a ray of hope to the disillusioned. </p> <p><b>The Perceptual Origins of Excellence</b></p> <p> This book questions some of nursing's most dearly held beliefs and assumptions. The book asserts that perceptual awareness is central to good nursing judgment and that this begins with vague hunches and global assessments that initially bypass critical analysis; conceptual clarity follows more often than it precedes. Experienced nurses often describe their perceptual abilities using phrases such as "gut feeling," a "sense of uneasiness," or a "feeling that things are not quite right." This kind of talk makes educators and clinicians uncomfortable, because the assessment must move from these perceptual beginnings to conclusive evidence. Expert nurses know that in all cases definitive evaluation of a patient's condition requires more than vague hunches, but through experience they have learned to allow their perceptions to lead to confirming evidence. </p> <p> In the quest for a scientific rationale, the importance of perceptual skills can be overlooked by any clinician &#x2014; nurse, physician, or counselor. If nurses were disembodied computers or mechanical monitoring devices, they would have to wait for clear, explicit signals before identifying one singular feature of a problem. Fortunately, however, expert human decision makers can get a gestalt of the situation and proceed to follow up on vague, subtle changes in the patient's condition with a confirmatory search aided by the whole health care team. Experts dare not stop with vague hunches, but neither do they dare to ignore those hunches that could lead to early identification of problems and the search for confirming evidence. </p> <p><b>The Importance of Discretionary Judgment</b></p> <p> Considering the early history of nursing education in this country, I am concerned that the model of skill acquisition described here could be misinterpreted as advocating informal trial-and-error learning. Therefore, it is important to point out that the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition was originally developed in research designed to study pilots' performance in emergency situations. In that context, no one worried that people might misinterpret the model and suggest that the pilot should just go out and "get the feel of the plane" through trial and error; under those circumstances the beginning pilot would not even survive basic training. The same holds true for nursing. Providing nursing care involves risks for both nurse and patient, and skilled nursing requires well-planned educational programs. Experience-based skill acquisition is safer and quicker when it rests upon a sound educational base. </p> <p> This book's purpose is to present the limits of formal ales and call attention to the discretionary judgment used actual clinical situations. This does not place the expert a special, privileged position outside the principles of physiology, nursing, and medicine. The book does not advocate a chaotic or anarchical position that would claim there are no rules &#x2014; that would confer a license, for instance, to ignore the rules of asepsis simply because sterile technique must be sometimes ignored in life-and-death emergencies. Attending to the particular contingencies of a situation does not warrant the inclusion that the general principles governing that station can be generally ignored. My position is not a careless recommendation for the abandonment of rules. Instead, I am claiming that a more skilled, advanced understanding of the situation allows orderly behavior without rigid rule following. </p> <p> Once the situation is described, the actions taken can understood as orderly, reasonable behavior that demands of a given situation rather than rigid principles and rules. More descriptive rules could be generated to allow for multiple exceptions, but the expert would still function flexibly in other new situations requiring new exceptions. The book addresses the risky, situation-specific decisions that are usually covered up but that nurses face daily in their practice. Menzies (1960) referred to hiding behind rules and policies as a defense against anxiety, a coping strategy. But as a coping strategy it is unrealistic and creates the additional burden of lack of recognition and legitimization of actual nursing performance. </p> <p><b>Reflecting the Realities of Practice</b></p> <p> Readers would probably prefer that I had chosen only exemplars reflecting ideal collaborative behaviors and ideal relationships with physicians. In fact, nursing administrators and physicians have warned me that they do not like the exemplars showing the doctor-nurse relationship in a bad light. I, too, wish that in conducting this study I had found only enlightened, collaborative relationships between nurses and physicians, but that would have been fiction and not descriptive research &#x2014; an ideal model instead of an empirically tested one. If there is a bias, it is probably in the other direction: that troubled nurse-physician exchanges are <i>under-represented,</i> given the amount of interview time nurses spent describing troubled interactions. </p> <p> In the real world, nurses and physicians alike have good and bad days; some are frankly incompetent. When immediate physician attention to a crisis is not available, the nurse fills the gap far more often than is formally acknowledged. We can claim that this is not nursing, but we do so only by ignoring what nurses actually do. Therefore, skilled performance was considered excellent because, even lacking the best of circumstances (e.g., collaborative relationships or formally acknowledged nursing functions), the nurse procured or did what was needed for the patient. By attending to the ideal and presenting only what we hope to become, we would miss much of what is significant about our actual practice. Not knowing who and what we are about <i>now</i> will seriously impede what we want to become. </p> <p><b>A Kaleidoscope of Intimacy and Distance</b></p> <p> The reader would be correct to question the representativeness of this work. The goal was not to describe a typical day or hour but rather the highlights, the ,growing edges of clinical knowledge. The participants were asked to present clinical situations that stood out in their minds. Nurses make many contacts with patients daily; most of the time they are unaware of the impact their interventions have on the patient's recovery. Many of these contacts and interventions are routine and not even remembered by the nurses. In other words, the nurse-patient relationship is not a uniform professionalized blueprint but rather a kaleidoscope of intimacy and distance in some of the most dramatic, poignant, and mundane moments of life. The mundane moments were not captured because this research strategy asked specifically for outstanding clinical situations. So this bias remains, even though we asked for descriptions of both typical and unusual days. Since we sought to describe skilled performance, deficits were not the point of inquiry, there are no negative examples of deficits identified (see Fenton, pp. 262-74 for an example of identification of deficits). </p> <p><b>Not an End but a Beginning</b></p> <p> I am concerned about hasty system builders who will want deify the 31 competencies described or who might want p complete the list, as though there were a finite list of competencies that can be captured for all time. Ending with 31 is indeed a bit whimsical, but the intent of this work is to encourage nurses to collect their own exemplars and to pursue the lines of inquiry and research questions raised by their own clinical knowledge. This work presents new ways to view nursing practice so that we do not continue to limit the description of such practice to a simplified, linear, problem-solving process. Such uniformity and constriction limit our understanding of the complexity and significance of our practice. As one nurse said with a note of realization, in a group discussion: "You know, I acted very quickly and saved a baby's life today. That's not insignificant!" It seemed that she had failed to take account of the import of her actions in her earlier analytical reporting. </p> <p> I am grateful to colleagues who have enriched this work by providing descriptions &#x2014; an early map, so to speak &#x2014; of the practical applications of this work (see Epilogue). </p> <p> Patricia Benner </p></p><h2>Digital Painting Techniques: Practical Techniques of Digital Art Masters (Digital Art Masters Series)</h2><p>Discover the tips, tricks and techniques that really work for concept artists, matte painters and animators.

He announces his engagement to a 12 year old girl, to his family's consternation.</p><p>Penelope Fitzgerald wrote her first novel 20 years ago, at the age of 59. Since then, she's written eight more, three of which have been short-listed for England's prestigious Booker Prize, and one of which, <i>Offshore,</i> won. Now she's back with her tenth and best book so far, <i>The Blue Flower</i>. This is the story of Friedrich von Hardenberg--Fritz, to his intimates--a young man of the late 18th century who is destined to become one of Germany's great romantic poets. In just over 200 pages, Fitzgerald creates a complete world of family, friends and lovers, but also an exhilarating evocation of the romantic era in all its political turmoil, intellectual voracity, and moral ambiguity. A profound exploration of genius, <i>The Blue Flower</i> is also a charming, wry, and witty look at domestic life. Fritz's family--his eccentric father and high-strung mother; his loving sister, Sidonie; and brothers Erasmus, Karl, and the preternaturally intelligent baby of the family, referred to always as the Bernhard--are limned in deft, sure strokes, and it is in his interactions with them that the ephemeral quality of genius becomes most tangible. Even his unlikely love affair with young Sophie von K�hn makes perfect sense as Penelope Fitzgerald imagines it. <p> <i>The Blue Flower</i> is a magical book--funny, sad, and deeply moving. In Fritz Fitzgerald has discovered a perfect character through whom to explore the meaning of love, poetry, life, and loss. In <i>The Blue Flower</i> readers will find a work of fine prose, fierce intelligence, and perceptive characterization.</p>Mariner paperback, 1997, previous ISBN&nbsp;978-0-395-85997-1</p><h2>The Mimosa Tree Mystery (Crown Colony)</h2><p><p><b>'Simply glorious.

But first of all there is the vexed matter of the custody of the pumpkin. </p><p>Skipping an ocean and a continent, Wodehouse also treats us to some unputdownable stories of excess from the monstrous Golden Age of Hollywood.</p><b>P.

All too often we leave that to Christian theologians. But in this excellent volume, Rabbi Joseph Telushkin puts the commandment to love at the center of Jewish theology and experience. This is a book that will change the way you think about&#x2013;and practice&#x2013;Judaism.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Professor Ari L. Goldman, Columbia University, and author of <i>The Search for God at Harvard</i><br><br>&#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself&#x201d; is the best-known commandment in the Bible. Yet we rarely hear anyone talk about how to apply these words in daily life. In this landmark work, Rabbi Joseph Telushkin, one of the premier scholars and thinkers of our time, gives both Jews and non-Jews an extraordinary summation of what Jewish tradition teaches about putting these words into practice.<br><br>Writing with great clarity and simplicity as well as with deep wisdom, Telushkin covers topics such as love and kindness, hospitality, visiting the sick, comforting mourners, charity, relations between Jews and non-Jews, compassion for animals, tolerance, self-defense, and end-of-life issues. This second volume of the first major code of Jewish ethics written in the English language is breathtaking in its scope and will undoubtedly influence readers for generations to come. It offers hundreds of practical examples from the Torah, the Talmud, the Midrash, and both ancient and modern rabbinic commentaries&#x2013;as well as contemporary anecdotes&#x2013;all teaching us how to care for one another each and every day.<br><br><i>A Code of Jewish Ethics, Volume 2: Love Your Neighbor as Yourself </i>is a consummate work of scholarship. Like its acclaimed predecessor, which received the National Jewish Book Award, it is rich with ideas to contemplate and discuss, while being primarily a book to live by. Nothing could be more important in these strife-torn times than learning how to love our neighbors as ourselves. The message of this book is as vital and timely now as it has been since time immemorial.</p><p><b>Rabbi Joseph Telushkin</b> is a spiritual leader and scholar, and the author of 15 books, including <i>Jewish Literacy</i> and <i>The Book of Jewish Values</i>. He is also a senior associate of CLAL, the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership; a board member of the Jewish Book Council; and the rabbi of the Los Angeles&#x2013;based Synagogue for the Performing Arts. He lives in New York City and lectures regularly throughout the United States.1<br><br>THE MAJOR PRINCIPLE OF THE TORAH<br><br>The central commandment<br><br>1. Even though the Torah ascribes no special significance to the verse &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself,&#x201d; Jewish sources have long understood this commandment as having special&#x2014;and in some ways preeminent&#x2014;significance. Rabbi Akiva (second century) declared that the injunction to love your neighbor &#x201c;is the major principle of the Torah&#x201d; (Jerusalem Talmud, Nedarim 9:4).<br><br>2. More than a century before Akiva, Hillel presented a negative formulation of this law, &#x201c;What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.&#x201d; He also declared this to be Judaism&#x2019;s central teaching: &#x201c;This is the whole Torah! All the rest is commentary&#x201d; (Shabbat 31a).* Occasionally, I have heard people describe Hillel&#x2019;s formulation of the Golden Rule as representing a lower, more pragmatic ethic than the positive but vaguely phrased &#x201c;Love your neighbor.&#x201d; But, in fact, Hillel was concerned with offering people practical guidance on how to make this law part of their daily behavior, and he understood that it is first necessary to teach people what not to do.<br><br>In defining Judaism initially by what one shouldn&#x2019;t do, Hillel may have been emulating God&#x2019;s articulation of the Ten Commandments. Thus, my friend Dr. Isaac Herschkopf notes that &#x201c;God did not command us to be honest, truthful, and faithful. Rather, He commanded us, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t steal,&#x2019; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t bear false witness,&#x2019; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t commit adultery.&#x2019; It might be less positive, but it is undeniably more effective.&#x201d; <br><br>*For more on the significance of moral behavior within Judaism, see A Code of Jewish Ethics, Volume 1: You Shall Be Holy, pages 10&#x2013;25.<br><br>A 1980s experiment conducted with American sixth-graders addressed young people&#x2019;s differing responses to positive and negative formulations of the Golden Rule (&#x201c;Do unto others as you would have others do unto you&#x201d;). Educator Ron Rembert asked the students to compose two lists, one consisting of actions they would want others to do for them, the others of actions they would not want done. Their list of &#x201c;Do&#x2019;s&#x201d; was short, focusing primarily on &#x201c;love,&#x201d; &#x201c;respect,&#x201d; and &#x201c;help.&#x201d; Their list of &#x201c;Don&#x2019;ts&#x201d; was longer, and included &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hit . . . steal . . . laugh at . . . snub . . . cheat.&#x201d; Rembert pointed out that &#x201c;the list of &#x2018;Don&#x2019;ts&#x2019; . . . included specific behaviors which are relatively easy to identify [while] the list of &#x2018;Do&#x2019;s&#x2019; . . . focused upon general attitudes and behaviors which are more difficult to define.&#x201d; Professor Jeffrey Wattles cited this study in his book The Golden Rule, and noted that &#x201c;The students concluded that the negative version of the Golden Rule would be easier to follow than the positive version.&#x201d;1<br><br>3. The centrality of love in Jewish teachings also characterizes many post-talmudic texts. To cite but one example: The medieval Tanna D&#x2019;Bei Eliyahu attributes to God one crucial request from the Jewish people: &#x201c;This is what the Holy One said to Israel: &#x2018;My children, what do I want from you? I want no more than that you love one another and treat one another with dignity.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>4. In the Torah, the commandment to love is immediately preceded by prohibitions against taking revenge and bearing a grudge. At some point, we all hurt other people&#x2014;intentionally or not&#x2014;and then hope fervently that our victims not take revenge or bear us a grudge. To love our neighbor as ourself means, therefore, to act toward others as we would like them to act toward us. If we want those we have provoked to let go of vengeful feelings, then we must act the same way when others hurt us.<br><br>Holding on to grudges is self-destructive as well as destructive. Rabbi Abraham Twerski, M.D., a psychiatrist who has devoted most of his professional career to working with people with addictions, notes that recovering alcoholics often relapse because of their inability to suppress anger and grudges against people who have hurt them. One man&#x2014;who understood how vital it was for his own well-being not to bear grudges&#x2014;told Twerski: &#x201c;Carrying resentments is like letting someone whom you don&#x2019;t like live inside your head rent-free.&#x201d;<br><br>This insight applies to everyone, not just recovering alcoholics, for many of us spend hours, days, even months, preoccupied with thoughts of the person or people we most dislike. Rabbi Twerski asks wisely: &#x201c;Why would anyone allow that?&#x201d;2<br><br>5. The commandment to love is followed by the words &#x201c;I am God.&#x201d; What is the connection between these two statements? Jewish tradition understands the commandment to love our neighbor as rooted in the belief that all human beings are created by God and thus are part of one extended family. As the prophet Malachi asks: &#x201c;Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us?&#x201d; (Malachi 2:10). From this perspective, the command to love other people is similar to the expectation that we love our siblings; we and they share a parent or parents in common. In addition, the failure to show love and kindness to others reveals not only an emotionally stingy nature, but also a denial of the biblical teaching that the people we encounter are, like us, created by God in His image and should be treated as such.<br><br>On purely logical grounds, if there is no God commanding us to love our neighbor, then there is no rational reason why we should feel obligated to do so. John Locke wrote in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690): &#x201c;Should that most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtues, &#x2018;that one should do [unto others] as he would be done unto,&#x2019; be proposed to one who had never heard of it before . . . might he not without any absurdity ask a reason why?&#x201d; Since Locke posed this question over three centuries ago, no one has offered a logically compelling reason why we should love our neighbor as ourself (on the relationship between God and ethics, see A Code of Jewish Ethics, Volume 1: You Shall Be Holy, pages 480&#x2013;486).<br><br>6. While the command to &#x201c;love your neighbor as yourself&#x201d; is explicitly stated, a moment&#x2019;s reflection reveals that this verse suggests an implicit command as well: to love ourselves. A person who has low regard for himself is unlikely to consistently carry out the injunction &#x201c;as yourself&#x201d; in a loving way. Indeed, one wonders whether there has ever been an abusive parent with a decent self-image. This is why even if self-love does not come naturally or easily, we are obligated&#x2014;for the sake of others as well as ourselves&#x2014;to cultivate a sense of self-esteem and liking.<br><br>Think about your own behavior. Are you more likely to be patient, forgiving, and generous to others when you are feeling good about yourself or when you are feeling low and self-critical? A sense of personal well-being and accomplishment tend to translate into a more joyful and accepting attitude toward others, including family members. However, when we are feeling unsure of ourselves and self-critical, we often become more disapproving and less forgiving of others.<br><br>A healthier attitude toward ourselves is one I saw cited in a newspaper article and attributed to an anonymous third-grade boy: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make people like me, but if I wasn&#x2019;t me, I would like me.&#x201d;<br><br>What does it mean to love your neighbor as yourself?<br><br>7. The wording of the Torah&#x2019;s commandment&#x2014;with its emphasis on &#x201c;neighbor,&#x201d;* implying a person whom we see often&#x2014;suggests that this mitzvah relates to tangible behavior and not simply to abstract love, as would be the case had the Torah instructed us to &#x201c;Love humanity.&#x201d;&#x2020; That is why Jewish legal texts generally focus on the actions this commandment entails. Thus, Maimonides emphasizes loving behavior far more than the emotion of love:<br><br>OIn &#x201c;Laws of Mourning,&#x201d; he describes as outgrowths of this command a series of additional Jewish laws, including the commandments to visit the sick (see chapters 5&#x2013;7), to make sure that the dead are properly attended to and buried (see chapter 8), to comfort mourners (see chap-ter 9), and to act hospitably (see chapter 3). Maimonides also notes our <br><br>*The precise meaning of the Hebrew word re-acha is &#x201c;your fellow,&#x201d; which, like neighbor, suggests someone with whom we routinely have contact (of course, we are also obligated to act in a loving and helpful way even toward those with whom we have more casual interactions or perhaps none, such as victims of a natural catastrophe). I have followed the translation of &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself&#x201d; since it is so widely known.<br><br>&#x2020;The character Linus, in Charles Schultz&#x2019;s comic strip Peanuts, was famed for his comment &#x201c;I love humanity! It&#x2019;s people I can&#x2019;t stand.&#x201d; A scene from Dostoevsky&#x2019;s The Brothers Karamazov expresses this more fully. Zosma describes to a visitor to his monk&#x2019;s cell a conversation he had years earlier with a doctor: &#x201c;He spoke just as frankly as you have done, but with humor, bitter humor. &#x2018;I love mankind,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;but I&#x2019;m surprised at myself: the more I love mankind in general, the less I love men in particular, that is, separately as individuals.&#x2019;&#x201d; The longer the doctor spoke, the sadder and more tragic his confession became: &#x201c;&#x2018;In my thoughts,&#x2019; he said to me, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve often had a passionate desire to serve humanity, and would perhaps have actually gone to the cross for mankind if I had ever been required to do so, and yet at the same time, as I well know from my personal experience, I&#x2019;m incapable of enduring two days in the same room with any other person. . . . Within one day, I can end up hating the very best of men, some because they&#x2019;ve taken too long over their dinner, others because they&#x2019;ve caught a cold and keep blowing their noses. I become a misanthrope,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;the minute I come into contact with people.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>obligation to provide for the needs of a bride, and to bring the bride and groom joy at their wedding (see pages 27&#x2013;28). Maimonides understands the law of love of neighbor as meaning that whatever you want others to do for you, you should do for them (&#x201c;Laws of Mourning&#x201d; 14:1).<br><br>OIn &#x201c;Laws of Character Development&#x201d; (De&#x2019;ot), he offers additional examples of how to practice this commandment. For example: &#x201c;One should speak in praise of another, and be careful about another&#x2019;s money [and possessions] just as he is careful about his own money, and wants his own dignity preserved&#x201d; (6:3).3 These examples express two important components of loving behavior: emotional support for others (praising them), and material support (helping safeguard their money).4<br><br>OIn &#x201c;Laws of Gifts to the Poor,&#x201d; Maimonides notes that among the commandments violated by someone who does not actively involve himself in redeeming captives is &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself&#x201d; (8:10).<br><br>OIn Maimonides&#x2019; enumeration of the 613 commandments, he describes how this law should be translated into action: &#x201c;Whatever I wish for myself, I should wish the same for that person. And whatever I do not wish for myself or for my friends, I should not wish for that person. That is the meaning of the verse, &#x2018;Love your neighbor as yourself&#x2019;&#x201d; (Book of the Commandments, positive commandment # 206).<br><br>A contemporary Jewish writer comments on what it means in concrete terms to fulfill Maimonides&#x2019; words, &#x201c;Whatever I do not wish for myself or for my friends, I should not wish for that person&#x201d;: &#x201c;As I would not want to suffer hunger, homelessness, joblessness, ill health, and disease, and personal tragedies of every kind, so too I would not wish that on others. And I would have to act to prevent these misfortunes happening to them.&#x201d; Regarding Maimonides&#x2019; words, &#x201c;Whatever I wish for myself, I should wish the same for that person,&#x201d; he continues: &#x201c;If I wish to have peace of mind, security, a decent living, friends, family, good health for myself, I am to wish that for others also, and to act in such a way as to allow others to have those blessings&#x201d; (Danny Siegel).5<br><br>Nachmanides (thirteenth century) questioned the literal meaning of &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself,&#x201d; reasoning that the Torah would not issue such a command because &#x201c;man cannot be expected to love his neighbor as his own soul.&#x201d; Rather, the Torah meant that &#x201c;we should wish our neighbor to enjoy the same well-being as we enjoy ourselves,&#x201d; and to have this wish with &#x201c;no reservations&#x201d; (that is, without the desire to feel superior to our neighbor).<br><br>Building on this insight, Naftali Hertz Wessely (eighteenth century), author of a commentary on Leviticus (part of Moses Mendelssohn&#x2019;s Biur commentary on the Torah) offers an example that illustrates why feeling the same level of love for all others as for ourselves is impossible: &#x201c;To fulfill such a command to the letter, man would have to grieve for his fellow&#x2019;s sorrows just as he grieves for his own. This would be intolerable since scarcely a moment passes without hearing of someone&#x2019;s misfortunes.&#x201d;6 If people consistently react to the sufferings of others with the same intensity with which they react to their own (for example, grieving over the death of someone else&#x2019;s child as they would grieve if their own child died), we would soon find ourselves, and all humanity, in a permanent state of depression.*<br><br>Another reason why it is important to define the commandment to love in terms of behavior rather than emotions: Emotions are vague and can be difficult, sometimes even impossible, to delineate. Even people who are emotionally or physically brutal to others&#x2014;for example, some spouses to each other, some parents to children&#x2014;often insist that they love those whom they mistreat. And they mean it, or at least think they do. Thus, I have often heard it said of a parent known to be abusive that, at some level, he actually loves his children. If, indeed, that is true, then it underscores why defining love in terms of emotions, instead of deeds, is pointless since the word &#x201c;love&#x201d; could then be used to encompass behavior ranging from the greatest kindness and consideration to outright cruelty. It is only when love is defined in terms of behavior that people can be offered practical guidance in how to treat others.<br><br>8. Deuteronomy 10:18&#x2013;19 provides yet another indication that love in the Torah is defined primarily through actions. Verse 19 commands the Israelites &#x201c;to love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt,&#x201d; while verse 18 teaches that God &#x201c;loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.&#x201d; The Torah&#x2019;s instruction to the Israelites to follow in God&#x2019;s ways (Deuteronomy 28:9), means that their love for the stranger should be <br><br>*This would be bad not only for the person experiencing the depression, but also for the recipient of the depressed person&#x2019;s love. The late rabbi Louis Jacobs made the point that he would not want his doctor to take his case too personally because, overcome with emotion, he would not be able to think or operate rationally.<br><br>expressed, as is God&#x2019;s, by providing them with food and clothing and taking care of their other needs.<br><br>Also, the rationale for loving the stranger, &#x201c;for you were strangers in the land of Egypt,&#x201d; makes no sense if it refers to emotions. Why should the fact that the Israelites were &#x201c;strangers&#x201d; in Egypt, in and of itself, cause them to feel love for other strangers? But it makes perfect sense if what is being commanded is loving behavior, so that Jews are instructed to treat the stranger &#x201c;in the way Jews would have liked to have been treated when they were strangers in Egypt&#x201d; (Professor Steven Harvey).7<br><br>Professor Harvey points out that while it is impossible to expect masses of people to feel the same &#x201c;sincere and unbounded desire and concern for the well-being of others [as they have for themselves], what can be commanded is the performance of acts of love, treating others as one would if one truly cared about their well-being.&#x201d;8</p><h2>Data, a Love Story: How I Cracked the Online Dating Code to Meet My Match</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Amy Webb found her true love after a search that's both charmingly romantic and relentlessly data-driven.

Two years later, his predictions were borne out by the rise to power of a series of political outsiders whose economic nationalism and authoritarian tendencies threatened to destabilize the entire international order. These populist nationalists seek direct charismatic connection to &#x201c;the people,&#x201d; who are usually defined in narrow identity terms that offer an irresistible call to an in-group and exclude large parts of the population as a whole. </p><p>Demand for recognition of one&#x2019;s identity is a master concept that unifies much of what is going on in world politics today. The universal recognition on which liberal democracy is based has been increasingly challenged by narrower forms of recognition based on nation, religion, sect, race, ethnicity, or gender, which have resulted in anti-immigrant populism, the upsurge of politicized Islam, the fractious &#x201c;identity liberalism&#x201d; of college campuses, and the emergence of white nationalism. Populist nationalism, said to be rooted in economic motivation, actually springs from the demand for recognition and therefore cannot simply be satisfied by economic means. The demand for identity cannot be transcended; we must begin to shape identity in a way that supports rather than undermines democracy.</p><p><i>Identity</i> is an urgent and necessary book&#x2015;a sharp warning that unless we forge a universal understanding of human dignity, we will doom ourselves to continuing conflict.</p></p><p><b>Francis Fukuyama</b> is the Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at Stanford University&#x2019;s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

We are in the very midst of a Revolution, the most complete, unexpected, and remarkable of any in the history of nations.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;John Adams, Sunday, June 9, 1776<br><br>&#x201c;Remember the Ladies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Abigail Adams, to her husband as the Founders debated independence<br><br>Night was about to fall. As daylight faded on Friday, June 10, 1768, officials of the British Crown stepped across the wharves of Boston Harbor to seize the Liberty, a sloop owned by the merchant John Hancock of Massachusetts. The charge: that Hancock&#x2019;s men had smuggled casks of Madeira wine from the Liberty&#x2019;s hold to avoid paying stiff duties recently imposed under the hated Townshend Acts. Anticipating trouble, the imperial authorities had deployed the heavily armed warship HMS Romney&#x2014;which contemporaries described as a &#x201c;fine new 50-Gun ship&#x201d;&#x2014;for the task. &#x201c;This conduct provoked the People, who had collected on the Shore,&#x201d; The Boston Gazette reported, and the gathering of colonials surged toward the British collector of customs, Joseph Harrison, as he came back off the Liberty. On the street adjoining the harbor, Harrison wrote, &#x201c;we were pursued by the Mob which by this time was increased to a great multitude. The onset was begun by throwing dirt at me, which was presently succeeded by volleys of stones, brickbats, sticks, or anything that came to hand. . . . About this time I received a violent blow on the breast which had like to have brought me to the ground, and I verily believe that if I had fallen, I should never have got up again, the People to all appearance being determined on blood and murder.&#x201d;<br><br>The royal governor of Massachusetts was flummoxed, denouncing what he called this &#x201c;Great Riot&#x201d; in dispatches to London. The colonials, naturally, had a different view. To them, the specter of the Romney taking control of Hancock&#x2019;s Liberty was an outrage, a veritable act of war. &#x201c;We will support our liberties,&#x201d; a patriot leader cried in the wake of the seizure, &#x201c;depending upon the strength of our own arms and God.&#x201d;<br><br>Hearing the news, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania was moved to pick up his pen to strike a blow in favor of the colonial cause. Born in 1732, raised in Dover, Delaware, and trained as a lawyer in Philadelphia and at the Middle Temple in London, Dickinson had recently published an influential series of essays entitled Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies. The Townshend Acts had been the occasion for Dickinson&#x2019;s Letters; in Boston, Joseph Harrison had found Dickinson&#x2019;s writings &#x201c;inflaming and seditious . . . tending to poison and incense the minds of the people and alienate them from all regard and obedience to the Legislature of the Mother Country.&#x201d;<br><br>A sustained attempt to argue for the justice of the colonial view that representation was a civil right in the English tradition, the Letters would bring Dickinson acclaim, including an honorary degree from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University). &#x201c;From infancy,&#x201d; Dickinson had written, &#x201c;I was taught to love liberty and humanity.&#x201d;<br><br>To him and to many of his readers, taxation without representation&#x2014;including duties on Madeira&#x2014;was intolerable. &#x201c;A free people,&#x201d; Dickinson had written, &#x201c;can never be too quick in observing, nor too firm in opposing, the beginnings of alterations . . . respecting institutions formed for their security.&#x201d; It was essential, he wrote, to guard against the &#x201c;servitude&#x201d; that could be &#x201c;slipped upon us&#x201d; by new laws and their vigorous enforcement.<br><br>His Letters had been prose. Now, in the wake of the clash in Boston, he would try poetry, composing a series of verses in honor of the resistance in Massachusetts. &#x201c;I enclose you a song for American freedom,&#x201d; Dickinson wrote James Otis of Boston. &#x201c;I have long since renounced poetry, but as indifferent songs are very powerful on certain occasions, I venture to invoke the deserted muses.&#x201d; He told Otis that Arthur Lee of Virginia, a Dickinson friend, had contributed eight lines of &#x201c;The Liberty Song.&#x201d; Published in Philadelphia and in The Boston Gazette of July 18, 1768, the song was set to William Boyce&#x2019;s &#x201c;Heart of Oak,&#x201d; a patriotic British number popular with the Royal Navy.<br><br>Come join hand in hand, brave Americans all,<br><br>And rouse your bold hearts at fair Liberty&#x2019;s call;<br><br>No tyrannous acts shall suppress your just claim,<br><br>Or stain with dishonor America&#x2019;s name.<br><br>In freedom we&#x2019;re born, and in freedom we&#x2019;ll live;<br><br>Our purses are ready,<br><br>Steady, Friends, steady,<br><br>Not as slaves, but as freemen our money we&#x2019;ll give.<br><br>Our worthy forefathers&#x2014;let&#x2019;s give them a cheer&#x2014;<br><br>To climates unknown did courageously steer;<br><br>Thro&#x2019; oceans, to deserts, for freedom they came,<br><br>And, dying, bequeath&#x2019;d us their freedom and fame.<br><br>Their generous bosoms all dangers despis&#x2019;d,<br><br>So highly, so wisely, their birthrights they priz&#x2019;d;<br><br>We&#x2019;ll keep what they gave, we will piously keep,<br><br>Nor frustrate their toils on the land and the deep.<br><br>The Tree, their own hands had to Liberty rear&#x2019;d,<br><br>They lived to behold growing strong and rever&#x2019;d;<br><br>With transport they cry&#x2019;d, &#x201c;Now our wishes we gain,<br><br>For our children shall gather the fruits of our pain.&#x201d;<br><br>Swarms of placemen and pensioners soon will appear,<br><br>Like locusts deforming the charms of the year;<br><br>Suns vainly will rise, showers vainly descend,<br><br>If we are to drudge for what others shall spend.<br><br>Then join hand in hand brave Americans all,<br><br>By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall;<br><br>In so righteous a cause let us hope to succeed,<br><br>For Heaven approves of each generous deed.<br><br>All ages shall speak with amaze and applause,<br><br>Of the courage we&#x2019;ll show in support of our laws;<br><br>To die we can bear&#x2014;but to serve we disdain,<br><br>For shame is to freedom more dreadful than pain.<br><br>This bumper I crown for our sovereign&#x2019;s health,<br><br>And this for Britannia&#x2019;s glory and wealth;<br><br>That wealth and that glory immortal may be,<br><br>If she is but just&#x2014;and if we are but free.<br><br>Dickinson had great hopes for his work. Citing the example of Jean-Fran�ois-Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz, a wily seventeenth-century French cardinal and adventurer, he wrote: &#x201c;Cardinal de Retz always enforced his political operations by songs. I wish our attempt may be useful.&#x201d;<br><br>Dickinson&#x2019;s language was designed to appeal to the emotions of his broad audience. &#x201c;By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall&#x201d;; &#x201c;In so righteous a cause let us hope to succeed&#x201d;; &#x201c;To die we can bear, but to serve we disdain&#x201d;&#x2014;the song&#x2019;s message was unmistakable. Unity was all; a common cause would carry the day; the stakes could not be higher.<br><br>Here, in the middle of the summer of 1768, eight years before the Declaration of Independence, an American patriot was making a popular case for American identity and for American action not in the staid language of the political press but in the more universal and stirring genre of music. &#x201c;The Liberty Song&#x201d; quickly spread. &#x201c;The music began at high noon,&#x201d; The Boston Evening-Post reported of a Sunday, August 14, 1768, gathering, &#x201c;performed on various instruments, joined with voices; and concluding with the universally admired American Song of Liberty, the grandeur of its sentiment, and the easy flow of its numbers, together with an exquisite harmony of sound, afforded sublime entertainments to a numerous audience, fraught with a noble ardor in the cause of freedom.&#x201d; To John Adams, Dickinson had done something wondrous. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; Adams remarked of the song, &#x201c;is cultivating the sensations of freedom.&#x201d;<br><br>Dickinson&#x2019;s composition, Kenneth Silverman, a scholar of American Revolutionary culture, observed, &#x201c;became not so much useful as indispensable. . . . It enabled people to experience directly the idea of strength in unity, by enacting it in boisterous choral singing. . . . By wedding the current political arguments to music, Dickinson knew, he drew on emotional resources that the words alone could not muster.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet America did not declare its independence in the wake of Dickinson&#x2019;s song, or for eight years afterward. The ensuing period was marked by further taxes and protests, more debate over the nature of representative government, and rising concerns over the role of imperial authority in colonial affairs. How did a group of disparate British North Americans, subjects of the British Empire all their lives, decide to risk everything?</p><h2>Fabulous Feasts (Medieval Cookery and Ceremony)</h2><p>What did people who lived during the Middle Ages eat?

His work on the fantastic is indeed about a historical phenomenon that we recognize, about specific works that we may read, but it is also about the use and abuse of generic theory. As an essay in fictional poetics, <i>The Fantastic</i> is consciously structuralist in its approach to the generic subject. Todorov seeks linguistic bases for the structural features he notes in a variety of fantastic texts, including Potocki's <i>The Sargasso Manuscript</i>, Nerval's <i>Aur�lia</i>, Balzac's <i>The Magic Skin</i>, the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, Cazotte's <i>Le Diable Amoureux</i>, Kafka's <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, and tales by E.

The book is, in effect, a marvelous summing up of the series. The story centers on the visit of an American senator to Stockholm. Martin Beck tries to protect him from an international gang of terrorists, while they decide that Beck too should be removed from the scene. Interwoven with this basic story are two fascinating subplots. One, a classic mini-mystery, is the story of a millionaire pornographer bludgeoned to death in his own bathtub. The other is the story of a young girl, a Swedish hippie caught up unexpectedly in the maze of police bureaucracy. As in other Martin Beck books, the plot comes together in a totally unexpected climax.Maj Sj�wall and Per Wahl��, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. They plotted and researched each book together then wrote alternate chapters. The books were written over a ten year period and carefully planned to allow for gradual character development and evolving social commentary as the series continued.&nbsp;Mr Wahloo, who died in 1975, was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories, and novels.

Scattered over much of the world throughout most of their three-thousand-year-old history, are they one people or many? How do they resemble and how do they differ from Jews in other places and times? What have their relationships been to the cultures of their neighbors?<br>&nbsp;<br>To address these and similar questions, twenty-three of the finest scholars of our day&#x2014;archaeologists, cultural historians, literary critics, art historians , folklorists, and historians of relation, all affiliated with major academic institutions in the United States, Israel, and France&#x2014;have contributed their insight to <i>Cultures of the Jews.</i> The premise of their endeavor is that although Jews have always had their own autonomous traditions, Jewish identity cannot be considered immutable, the fixed product of either ancient ethnic or religious origins. Rather, it has shifted and assumed new forms in response to the cultural environment in which the Jews have lived.<br>&nbsp;<br>Building their essays on specific cultural artifacts&#x2014;a poem, a letter, a traveler&#x2019;s account, a physical object of everyday or ritual use&#x2014;that were made in the period and locale they study, the contributors describe the cultural interactions among different Jews&#x2014;from rabbis and scholars to non-elite groups, including women&#x2014;as well as between Jews and the surrounding non-Jewish world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Part One, &#x201c;Mediterranean Origins,&#x201d; describes the concept of the &#x201c;People&#x201d; or &#x201c;Nation&#x201d; of Israel that emerges in the Hebrew Bible and the culture of the Israelites in relation to that of the Canaanite groups. It goes on to discuss Jewish cultures in the Greco-Roman world, Palestine during the Byzantine period, Babylonia, and Arabia during the formative years of Islam.<br>&nbsp;<br>Part Two, &#x201c;Diversities of Diaspora,&#x201d; illuminates Judeo-Arabic culture in the Golden Age of Islam, Sephardic culture as it bloomed first if the Iberian Peninsula and later in Amsterdam, the Jewish-Christian symbiosis in Ashkenazic Europe and in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the culture of the Italian Jews of the Renaissance period, and the many strands of folklore, magic, and material culture that run through diaspora Jewish history.<br>&nbsp;<br>Part Three, &#x201c;Modern Encounters,&#x201d; examines communities, ways of life, and both high and fold culture in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, the Ladino Diaspora, North Africa and the Middle East, Ethiopia, Zionist Palestine and the State of Israel, and, finally, the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Cultures of the Jews</i> is a landmark, representing the fruits of the present generation of scholars in Jewish studies and offering a new foundation upon which all future research into Jewish history will be based. Its unprecedented interdisciplinary approach will resonate widely among general readers and the scholarly community, both Jewish and non-Jewish, and it will change the terms of the never-ending debate over what constitutes Jewish identity.</p><p><b>David Biale</b> is the Emanuel Ringelblum Professor of Jewish History at the University of California, Davis.

He lives in Berkeley, California.<b>IMAGINING THE BIRTH OF ANCIENT ISRAEL:<br><br>National Metaphors in the Bible<br></b><br><br>The Bible begins not with the culture of the Hebrews but with the origins of culture as such. The initial concern with the origin of civilization is already evident in the story of the Garden of Eden, where Eve and Adam acquire the first taste of &#x201c;knowledge,&#x201d; but it is only in the account of the bold building of the Tower of Babel, East of Eden, that we get a fuller consideration of human culture.<br><br>Humankind was once one, we are told, and &#x201c;everyone on earth had the same language and the same words&#x201d; (Genesis 11:1). But this era of cultural unity does not last for long. One day the people say to each other &#x201c;Come, let us build us a city, and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scattered all over the world&#x201d; (11:4). In response to this challenge against heaven, God shatters the builders&#x2019; dream of grandeur, confounds their language, and scatters them in all directions. Culture, however, is not destroyed. Rather, it assumes a different form. From now on its distinguishing mark is diversity and dispersion. From now on, its distinct site becomes the nation.<br><br>Of the many nations that &#x201c;branch out&#x201d; in the vast expanses of the earth, Israel is singled out. In the episode following the Tower of Babel, God demands that Abraham leave his birthplace (Ur of the Chaldeans) and go forth (lekh lekha) to the land shown to him. There, God assures him, &#x201c;I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great&#x201d; (Genesis 12:2). Abraham&#x2019;s migration to Canaan offers a new departure. Whereas the sinful homogeneous community of Babel failed, Abraham&#x2019;s descendants, the people God has chosen from a multitude of peoples, seem to hold much promise, destined as they are (unlike the builders of the Tower) to acquire a &#x201c;great name.&#x201d; The primary exile of the first patriarch, his capacity to part from his cultural origins, is construed as an essential rift, a prerequisite for the rise of the nation. Later, in Exodus, the people as a whole will follow a similar route, moving out of Egypt, wandering in the desert, and fashioning the cultural contours of the nation on their way to the Promised Land.<br><br>Dispersion and exile, however, do not lead to clear-cut borders between cultures. Languages intersect in unexpected ways. The very name &#x201c;Babel,&#x201d; which commemorates the primary linguistic splitting, is also a cross-cultural product. Its meaning in Akkadian is presumably &#x201c;the gate to the gods&#x201d; (bab iley), but in the course of the biblical story it is Hebraized via a pun when it is linked to<br><br>the Hebrew root blbl (to confuse). Perhaps this interpretation of &#x201c;Babel&#x201d; is an attempt to mock the pretentious temples of Mesopotamia: the tower that was meant to lead to the gods leads only to confusion.<br><br>But what turns out to be far more confusing is the lack of clear demarcation between the chosen and the non-chosen. As the history of the children of Israel unfolds, we discover that the rebellious quality of primeval culture does not dissipate once we move into the realm of the chosen ones. Quite the contrary: rebellion is one of the salient features of the chosen nation. The Israelites do not venture to construct brick temples whose tops reach heaven, but their idolatrous cravings betray a similar tendency to transgress sacred boundaries.<br><br>The question of national identity&#x2014;the attempt to fathom the entangled relations between Israel and God, between Israel and other nations&#x2014;is one of the most resonant and unresolvable questions in the Bible. In tackling it, the biblical text relies not on philosophical contemplation but rather on narrative. More specifically, it offers a narrative in which the nation is personified extensively. Any attempt to understand the history of the children of Israel, to fashion a conception of national identity, to grasp communal motives and fantasies, collective memories and oblivions, the Bible seems to suggest, requires a plunge into the intricate twists and turns of the individual life.<br><br>The nation&#x2014;particularly in Exodus and Numbers&#x2014;is not an abstract detached concept but rather a grand character with a distinct voice (represented at times in a singular mode) who moans and groans, is euphoric at times, complains frequently, and rebels against Moses and God time and again. Israel has a life story, a biography of sorts. It was conceived in the days of Abraham; its miraculous birth took place with the Exodus, the parting of the Red Sea; then came a long period of childhood and restless adolescence in the wilderness; and finally adulthood was approached with the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>To be sure, a collective character is necessarily more heterogeneous and less predictable. The Pentateuch&#x2019;s account of national formation resists fixed definitions of the various phases in the nation&#x2019;s life cycle. Roughly speaking, chronology is maintained, and yet images of birth, youth, initiation, and suckling intermingle throughout. Thus, the distinct manifestation of national suckling appears only in Numbers 11, where Moses likens the people to a suckling infant in the wilderness, long after the grand-scale initiation at Sinai. But, after all, such boundaries are never that clear in individual biographies either. Infantile dreams may linger on and initiation is rarely exhausted in one rite.<br><br>National literatures were not common in the ancient world. Israel&#x2019;s preoccupation with its reason for being is exceptional in the ancient Near East. In Greece and particularly in Rome, however, narratives concerning national origins are equally important. Israel&#x2019;s history bears resemblance to the Roman one. It too involves a divine promise, individuation from a major civilization, a quest for lost roots, a long journey to what is construed as the land of the forefathers, and a gory conquest. What makes the Bible unique is the extent to which the nation is dramatized. In the Aeneid, by way of comparison, the plot revolves round Aeneas. The wanderings between Troy and the promised new land are primarily Aeneas&#x2019;s wanderings: the people remain a rather pale foil. They engage in no conflict&#x2014;either with Aeneas or the gods&#x2014;that would grant them access to the central stage. The biblical text is significantly different in its rendering of national drama. Israel is a protagonist whose moves and struggles determine the map&#x2014;so much so that 40 years of wanderings in the desert are added to the itinerary as a result of the people&#x2019;s protest against the official preference of Canaan over Egypt.<br><br>The fashioning of Israel as a character is a forceful unifying strategy, but the metaphor does not yield a homogeneous account of national formation. The biblical text reveals points of tension between different traditions regarding the nation&#x2019;s history and character. Even the nation&#x2019;s sexual identity is not stable. Although the Pentateuch shapes a male character, referring to the people as am (singular masculine noun), the Prophets, more often than not, represent Israel as female, using &#x201c;Jerusalem&#x201d; or &#x201c;Zion&#x201d; (feminine nouns) as alternative designations.<br><br>This essay focuses on the intricacies of national imagination in the Pentateuch, and as such it is concerned with the fashioning of a male character who is marked as God&#x2019;s firstborn son. Double personification is at stake&#x2014;of God and the nation&#x2014;creating a familial link between the two. If Rome&#x2019;s sacred origin is assured through the divine blood of its founding fathers&#x2014;Aeneas is Venus&#x2019;s son, and Romulus and Remus are the offspring of Mars&#x2014;in the case of Israel, the nation as a whole, metaphorically speaking, is God&#x2019;s son. On sending Moses to Pharaoh to deliver the people, God proclaims: &#x201c;Israel is My first-born son. I have said to you [Pharaoh], &#x2018;Let My son go&#x2019; &#x201d; (Exodus 4:22&#x2013;23). The priority given to Israel by the Father represents a translation into national terms of the reversal of the primogeniture law&#x2014;a phenomenon so central in the lives of the patriarchs. The late-born nation that came to the stage after all its neighbors had assumed their historical roles is elevated by God to the position of the chosen firstborn.<br><br>Israel is a chosen nation, God&#x2019;s nation, but the reason for its chosen-ness remains obscure. It does not succeed in following traditional norms of male heroism, nor does it become an exemplary nation with high moral and religious standards. The more mature Israel, in the plains of Moab, on the threshold of Canaan, is far more established a community than the nascent nation on the way out of Egypt, but this by no means suggests that biblical historiography relies on the principle of progress. Whereas in the initial stages of the journey the children of Israel worship a Golden Calf in a carnivalesque feast, at the last station, just before crossing the Jordan river, they &#x201c;cling&#x201d; to Baal Peor (under the influence of Moabite women), adopting Canaanite religious practices with much enthusiasm. The Song of Moses, with its synoptic presentation of Israel&#x2019;s history, regards the nation as an ungrateful son whose conduct fails to improve over time: &#x201c;Do you thus requite the Lord, O dull and witless people? Is not He the Father who created you, fashioned you and made you endure!&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 32:6). Instead of appreciating God&#x2019;s vigilance, Moses claims, once the nation &#x201c;grew fat&#x201d; it used its new powers to &#x201c;kick&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 32:15).<br><br>What is most fascinating in the primary biography of ancient Israel is the ambivalence that lies at its very base, an ambivalence that is expressed so poignantly through the intense struggles between the Father (or Moses) and His people. The nation is both the chosen son and the rebel son, and accordingly its relationship with the Father is at once intimate and strained.<br><br>The fictional quality of the struggle between God and the nation does not preclude the historicity of the text. Israel&#x2019;s beginning is situated in historical times&#x2014;in the days of the Exodus&#x2014;rather than in a mythical &#x201c;in illo tempore.&#x201d; Similarly, God defines Himself, at Sinai and elsewhere, as the one who brought Israel out of Egypt&#x2014;not as the Creator of primeval times. Even at moments when the biography of ancient Israel relies on mythical materials&#x2014;primarily, on the myth of the birth of the hero and the myth of the hero&#x2019;s return&#x2014;these are inextricably connected with a historiographical drive to record memorable past events and question their meaning. In the Bible, history and literature go hand in hand, more explicitly than in modern historiography, which is why it serves as a paradigmatic case for the examination of the narrative base of national constructions.<br><br><b>National Birth</b><br><br>The metaphor of birth is probably the most resonant anthropomorphic image in national narratives from antiquity to modern times. In fact, it is so resonant one tends to forget that nations are not born literally but are, rather, imagined in these terms. Every nation, however, has its own birth story, or birth stories. The book of Exodus provides an intriguingly complex representation of Israel&#x2019;s birth in keeping with the preliminary imaginings of the nation in Genesis. The opening verses of Exodus 1 make clear that God&#x2019;s reiterated promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#x2014;the grand national annunciation scenes of Genesis&#x2014;are finally realized. The descendants of Jacob, whose names are listed solemnly, multiply at an uncanny pace and turn into a &#x201c;mighty&#x201d; nation: the nation of the &#x201c;children of Israel.&#x201d; &#x201c;Israel&#x201d; for the first time is not merely Jacob&#x2019;s second, elevated, name but rather a collective designation of a burgeoning community that &#x201c;fills&#x201d; the land. But then we discover that God&#x2019;s darker prophecy, in the covenant of the parts (Genesis 15:13), is equally fulfilled: Israel is born in a prolonged exile, against Pharaonic bondage.<br><br>Representing the birth of a nation is not a simple task. The imagining of this dramatic event in Exodus is facilitated by the interweaving of two biographies: the story of the birth of Moses, and that of the nation. The fashioning of Israel as character, here as elsewhere, is inseparable from a complementary narrative strategy: the marking of individuals whose histories are paradigmatic. The nation&#x2019;s life story, in other words, is modeled in relation to the biographies of select characters. Abraham, whose departure from Ur serves as prefiguration of the nation&#x2019;s exodus, is only the first exemplary figure. The heterogeneity of national imagination in the Bible depends on a variety of representatives. Fragments of the biographies of Isaac, of Jacob, the eponymous father, and even of Hagar, the Egyptian handmaid, whose affliction foreshadows the nation&#x2019;s enslavement in Egypt, are also linked in different ways to the nation&#x2019;s biography and take part in its construction.<br><br>On the question of birth, Moses&#x2019; story is of special importance. The analogy between the one and the multitude in this case is more immediate. Unlike the patriarchal biographies that pertain to a distant past and flicker over the chasm of time, Moses&#x2019; birth occurs within the same historical setting. Moses is a national leader whose history blends with the history of the nation. He is one of many Hebrew babies persecuted by Pharaoh. His story, however, is marked as the exemplary account that sheds light on the collective birth story as it prefigures the deliverance of the nation as a whole from bondage.<br><br>Moses&#x2019; birth story shares much in common with mythical birth stories. What characterizes the birth of a hero? The conception of the hero is usually impeded by difficulties such as abstinence or prolonged barrenness. During or before pregnancy there is a prophecy, or an oracle cautioning the father against the hero&#x2019;s birth; the father tries to shape a different future and gives orders to kill his new-born son; the babe is then placed in a basket or a box and delivered to the waves. Against all odds, however, the hero is saved by animals, or by lowly people, and is suckled by a female animal or by a humble woman. When full grown, he discovers his royal parents, takes revenge on his father, and, recognized by his people, finally achieves rank and honors.<br><br>Moses&#x2019; story is indeed compatible in many ways with this model: a threatened child, the exposure in the basket, the miraculous deliverance of the foundling, the two sets of parents, and the final acknowledgment of the hero&#x2019;s power. But there is a significant difference: Moses&#x2019; true parents are not the royal ones but rather the poor Hebrew slaves. At a moment of national birth, the inversion of the two sets of parents is not without significance. Moses&#x2019; &#x201c;true&#x201d; parents are higher in rank despite their lowly position precisely because they are members of the chosen nation-to-be.</p><h2>Couture: The Art of Fine Sewing</h2><p>Ideal for sewers with an interest in quality, style, and individuality, this book reveals techniques once only known to the seamstresses in the couture houses of Paris.</p><p></p><h2>Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals (Smithsonian Handbooks)</h2><p>The most comprehensive pocket guide to these early creatures and the world they inhabited millions of years ago.

Women's rights were expanding rapidly during Sayers's lifetime; she and her friends were some of the first women to receive degrees from Oxford. Yet, as historian Mo Moulton reveals, it was clear from the many professional and personal obstacles they faced that society was not ready to concede that women were indeed fully human. <br><br>Dubbing themselves the Mutual Admiration Society, Sayers and her classmates remained lifelong friends and collaborators as they fought for a truly democratic culture that acknowledged their equal humanity.

Based on the premise that reality is a dream controlled by malevolent forces, it is one of the most overtly philosophical movies ever to come out of Hollywood. These thought-provoking essays by the same team of young philosophers who created <i>The Simpsons and Philosophy</i> discuss different facets of the primary philosophical puzzle of The Matrix: Can we be sure the world is really there, and if not, what should we do about it? Other chapters address issues of religion, lifestyle, pop culture, the Zeitgeist, the nature of mind and matter, and the reality of fiction.</p><p>The many faces of Keanu Reeves as hero Neo-Christ, Buddha, Socrates-are explored in these essays on the philosophical implications of the sci-fi martial arts blockbuster The Matrix, collected by the editor of Seinfeld and Philosophy and The Simpsons and Philosophy. According to the academics assembled here, when messianic hacker Neo kick-boxes the Matrix's virtual-reality dream-prison, he is really struggling with some of mankind's biggest conundrums: the nature of truth and reality, the possibility of free will, the mind-body problem and the alienation of labor in late-capitalist society. The tacit goal here is to make philosophy fun for the general reader by orienting it to pop-culture reference points, so while some articles contain rather dense philosophical jargon, most are pitched at the level of a freshman intro course. But only a few chapters delve into the movie's aesthetics; the rest seem to use The Matrix as a peg on which to hang a canned philosophy lecture. The results are occasionally engaging, as with David Mitsuo Nixon's nifty refutation of the "reality is just an illusion" conceit, but they're too often dryly academic and liable to elicit no more than a drowsy "whoa" from the movie's legions of fans. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc."This collection of essays has something for nearly everyone interested in the intersection between philosophy and pop culture." -- <i>Utopian Studies Book Review, September, 2004</i></p><h2>Familiar Birds of North America: Eastern Region (National Audubon Society Pocket Guides)</h2><p><b><b>A portable, comprehensive field guide--brimming with concise descriptions and stunning color photographs, and designed to fit into your back pocket--from the go-to reference source for over 18 million nature lovers.</b><br></b><br> This streamlined volume identifies 80 of the most frequently encountered birds east of the Rocky Mountains.

Inside, he found two bodies sprawled on an ornate bed, blood oozing from their mouths. Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary appeared to have shot his seventeen-year-old mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera as she slept, sat with the corpse for hours and, when dawn broke, turned the pistol on himself.</p><p>A century has transformed this bloody scene into romantic tragedy: star-crossed lovers who preferred death together than to be parted by a cold, unfeeling Viennese Court. But Mayerling is also the story of family secrets: incestuous relationships and mental instability; blackmail, venereal disease, and political treason; and a disillusioned, morphine-addicted Crown Prince and a na�ve schoolgirl caught up in a dangerous and deadly waltz inside a decaying empire. What happened in that locked room remains one of history&#x2019;s most evocative mysteries: What led Rudolf and mistress to this desperate act? Was it really a suicide pact? Or did something far more disturbing take place at that remote hunting lodge and result in murder?</p><p>Drawing interviews with members of the Habsburg family and archival sources in Vienna, Greg King and Penny Wilson reconstruct this historical mystery, laying out evidence and information long ignored that conclusively refutes the romantic myth and the conspiracy stories.</p></p><p><p>GREG KING is the author of several internationally published works of history, including <i>The Assassination of the Archduke</i>.

They were read and heard and interpreted within the worshiping community. They served as sources for pastoral counsel and admonition for those who were committed to the Way. Although Matthew and John were generally the preferred Gospels, Luke, because of his particular interests and unique contributions, took pride of place during the Christmas season as well as during Easter and other major feasts. During the early patristic period, the tradition of continuous reading (<em>lectio continua</em>) through the Gospels developed, such that over a course of time a complete Gospel was read in sections, and sermons were preached on the readings either at weekly or midweek worship and Communion liturgies or during morning and evening prayer services. Among such sermons that have survived, this commentary includes selections from Origen and Cyril of Alexandria. Aside from sermons, we find that the fathers addressed exegetical issues in theological treatises, pastoral letters and catechetical lectures. Among these, as in other ACCS volumes, readers will find materials ranging from East to West and from the first to the eighth centuries. Among well-known fathers cited are Ambrose, Athanasius, Augustine, the Cappadocians, John Chrysostom, John of Damascus and Bede the Venerable. Among lesser-known fathers are John Cassian, Philoxenus of Mabbug and Theophylact. This volume, edited by Arthur A.

The ten Ox-Herding Pictures, the accompanying ancient poems, and a modern commentary by John Daido Loori, sketch the spiritual path encountered in Zen training, a path of exhaustive study of the self and the realization of the ultimate nature of reality. The Ox-Herding Pictures can be our companion on the Way of self-discovery, our compass and perspective when we need one. They are a bottomless source of mysterious wisdom to which we can return again and again for inspiration, and they translate easily into the gritty reality of spiritual practice that emerges from and grounds us in the inescapable relevance of our daily lives. <br><br> The exquisite versions of the pictures found in the book are traditional Chinese <i>nanga</i> brush paintings by Gyokusei Jikihara Sensei, a modern Japanese master of calligraphy and a teacher in the Obaku School of Zen. The traditional verses accompanying them have been translated by John Daido Loori and Kazuaki Tanahashi, translator and editor of <i>Enlightenment Unfolds: The Essential Teachings of Zen Master Dogen. </i></p><p>John Daido Loori (1931&#x2013;2009) was one of the West's leading Zen masters. He was the founder and spiritual leader of the Mountains and Rivers Order and abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery. His work has been most noted for its unique adaptation of traditional Asian Buddhism into an American context, particularly with regard to the arts, the environment, social action, and the use of modern media as a vehicle of spiritual training and social change. Loori was an award-winning photographer and videographer. His art and wildlife photography formed the core of a unique teaching program that integrated art and wilderness training by cultivating a deep appreciation of the relationship of Zen to our natural environment. He was a dharma heir of the influential Japanese Zen master Taizan Maezumi Roshi and he authored many books.Influential Zen Buddhist teacher Loori, abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery in New York, offers a clear commentary on "The Ox-herding Pictures," a traditional series of (usually) 10 pictures from 12th-century Chinese Zen master Kuoan accompanied by verses. The pictures form a characteristically wry Zen parable about the process of enlightenment. Loori successfully demonstrates his mastery of teaching: he makes the process simple and accessible, even while issuing cautions about how very, very hard the journey actually is. Loori is also a photographer, so his aesthetic sensibility lends richness to his use of the pictures as a teaching device in Zen study and practice. The herd of Zen oxen books continues to grow: Loori's nicely complements How to Raise an Ox by Francis Dojun Cook (Wisdom, May), an introduction to 13th-century Japanese Zen master Dogen that is more conceptual but equals Loori's in being a key to unlocking the considerable treasury of Zen heritage. (Indeed, both authors are students of Japanese Zen master Taizan Maezumi Roshi.) True, there is literature aplenty on Buddhism, but Loori is an authoritative and respected teacher and this small book, with illustrations in traditional brush painting style by Japanese calligrapher Gyokusei Jikihara Sensei, is effectively visual. It will make a great gift for a Zen student.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Buccaneers of America (Dover Maritime)</h2><p><p>A cross between genuine privateers, commissioned to defend a country's colonies and trade, and outright pirates, buccaneers were largely English, French, and Dutch adventurers who plied the waters among the Caribbean Islands and along the coasts of Central America, Venezuela, and Colombia more than 300 years ago. The activities of these bands of plundering sea rovers reached a peak in the second half of the seventeenth century, when this remarkable eyewitness account was first published (1678).<br>Alexander Exquemelin, thought to be a Frenchman who enlisted with the buccaneers for a time, chronicles the bold feats of these raiders as they ravaged shipping and terrorized Caribbean settlements. Exquemelin provides fascinating details of the French presence in Hispaniola (now comprising the island nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic) describes the features of that country and its inhabitants, and comments at length on the origin of the buccaneers, vividly recounting their rules of conduct and way of life. These bold plunderers come across as shrewd strategists, crack shots, fine navigators, wild debauchers, and greedy adventurers who frequently engaged in vicious acts of cruelty. Among the figures in his rogues' gallery, none stands out more than the infamous Henry Morgan, whose exploits culminated in the seizure and burning of Panama City.<br>A bestseller in its own time, <i>The Buccaneers of America</i> will fascinate any modern reader intrigued by piracy and by the often sordid history of European conflicts in the Caribbean and on the Spanish Main.</p><p></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch</p><h2>The Collector&#39;s Encyclopedia of Brush-McCoy Pottery: Updated Values</h2><p>Brush-McCoy Pottery has always been popular with collectors throughout the U.S. This Ohio company produced thousands of pieces from 1911 to 1925, in not only their staple commercial wares but also fine art ware.

Is it more awe-inspiring to suppose that a transcendent God fashioned the cell, or to consider that the living organism was created by the evolving biosphere? As the eminent complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman explains in this ambitious and groundbreaking new book, people who do not believe in God have largely lost their sense of the sacred and the deep human legitimacy of our inherited spirituality. For those who believe in a Creator God, no science will ever disprove that belief. In <i>Reinventing the Sacred</i>, Kauffman argues that the science of complexity provides a way to move beyond reductionist science to something new: a unified culture where we see God in the creativity of the universe, biosphere, and humanity. Kauffman explains that the ceaseless natural creativity of the world can be a profound source of meaning, wonder, and further grounding of our place in the universe. His theory carries with it a new ethic for an emerging civilization and a reinterpretation of the divine. He asserts that we are impelled by the imperative of life itself to live with faith and courage-and the fact that we do so is indeed sublime. <i>Reinventing the Sacred</i> will change the way we all think about the evolution of humanity, the universe, faith, and reason.</p><p><b>Stuart A. Kauffman</b> is the founding director of the Institute for Biocomplexity and Informatics and a professor of biological sciences, physics, and astronomy at the University of Calgary. He is Emeritus Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, a MacArthur Fellow, and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

Then I'll live in squalor in a Bronx tenement, where the toilet is shared by four apartments! My shirts will go unironed, my tie will be perpetually awry. <i>See what you've done to me?"</i></p><p>But when he told Alice about the apartment, she only laughed bitterly and said, "Not anymore, Howard. I won't play those games with you. You win every damn time."</p><p>She pretended not to care about him anymore, but Howard knew better. He knew people, knew what they wanted, and Alice wanted <i>him</i>. It was his strongest card in their relationship--that she wanted him more than he wanted her. He thought of this often: at work in the offices of Humboldt and Breinhardt, Designers; at lunch in a cheap lunchroom (part of the punishment); on the subway home to his tenement (Alice had kept the Lincoln Continental). He thought and thought about how much she wanted him. But he kept remembering what she had said the day she threw him out: If you ever come near Rhiannon again I'll kill you.</p><p>He could not remember why she had said that. Could not remember and did not try to remember because that line of thinking made him uncomfortable and one thing Howard insisted on being was comfortable with himself. Other people could spend hours and days of their lives chasing after some accommodation with themselves, but Howard was accommodated. Well adjusted. At ease. I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK. Hell with you. "If you let them make you feel uncomfortable," Howard would often say, "you give them a handle on you and they can run your life." Howard could find other people's handles, but they could never find Howard's.</p><p>It was not yet winter but cold as hell at three A.M. when Howard got home from Stu's party. A must attend party, if you wished to get ahead at Humboldt and Breinhardt. Stu's ugly wife tried to be tempting, but Howard had played innocent and made her feel so uncomfortable that she dropped the matter. Howard paid careful attention to office gossip and knew that several earlier departures from the company had got caught with, so to speak, their pants down. Not that Howard's pants were an impenetrable barrier. He got Dolores from the front office into the bedroom and accused her of making life miserable for him. "In little ways," he insisted. "I know you don't mean to, but you've got to stop."</p><p>"What ways?" Dolores asked, incredulous yet (because she honestly tried to make other people happy) uncomfortable.</p><p>"Surely you knew how attracted I am to you."</p><p>"No. That hasn't--that hasn't even crossed my mind."</p><p>Howard looked tongue-tied, embarrassed. He actually was neither. "Then--well, then, I was--I was wrong, I'm sorry, I thought you were doing it deliberately--"</p><p>"Doing what?"</p><p>"Snub--snubbing me--never mind, it sounds adolescent, just little things, hell, Dolores, I had a stupid schoolboy crush--"</p><p>"Howard, I didn't even know I was hurting you."</p><p>"God, how insensitive," Howard said, sounding even more hurt.</p><p>"Oh, Howard, do I mean that much to you?"</p><p>Howard made a little whimpering noise that meant everything she wanted it to mean. She looked uncomfortable. She'd do anything to get back to feeling right with herself again. She was so uncomfortable that they spent a rather nice half hour making each other feel comfortable again. No one else in the office had been able to get to Dolores. But Howard could get to anybody.</p><p>He walked up the stairs to his apartment feeling very, very satisfied. Don't need you, Alice, he said to himself. Don't need nobody, and nobody's who I've got. He was still mumbling the little ditty to himself as he went into the communal bathroom and turned on the light.</p><p>He heard a gurgling sound from the toilet stall, a hissing sound. Had someone been in there with the light off? Howard went into the toilet stall and saw nobody. Then looked closer and saw a baby, probably about two months old, lying in the toilet bowl. Its nose and eyes were barely above the water; it looked terrified, its legs and hips and stomach were down the drain. Someone had obviously hoped to kill it by drowning--it was inconceivable to Howard that anyone could be so moronic as to think it would fit down the drain.</p><p>For a moment he thought of leaving it there, with the big-city temptation to mind one's own business even when to do so would be an atrocity. Saving this baby would mean inconvenience: calling the police, taking care of the child in his apartment, perhaps even headlines, certainly a night of filling out reports. Howard was tired. Howard wanted to go to bed.</p><p>But he remembered Alice saying, "You aren't even human, Howard. You're a goddam selfish monster." I am not a monster, he answered silently, and reached down into the toilet bowl to pull the child out.</p><p>The baby was firmly jammed in--whoever had tried to kill it had meant to catch it tight. Howard felt a brief surge of genuine indignation that anyone could think to solve his problems by killing an innocent child. But thinking of crimes committed on children was something Howard was determined not to do, and besides, at that moment he suddenly acquired other things to think about.</p><p>As the child clutched at Howard's arm, he noticed the baby's fingers were fused together into flipperlike flaps of bone and skin at the end of the arm. Yet the flippers gripped his arms with an unusual strength as, with two hands deep in the toilet bowl, Howard tried to pull the baby free.</p><p>At last, with a gush, the child came up and the water finished its flushing action. The legs, too, were fused into a single limb that was hideously twisted at the end. The child was male; the genitals, larger than normal, were skewed off to one side. And Howard noticed that where the feet should be were two more flippers, and near the tips were red spots that looked like putrefying sores. The child cried, a savage mewling that reminded Howard of a dog he had seen in its death throes. (Howard refused to be reminded that it had been he who killed the dog by throwing it out in the street in front of a passing car, just to watch the driver swerve; the driver hadn't swerved.)</p><p>Even the hideously deformed have a right to live, Howard thought, but now, holding the child in his arms, he felt a revulsion that translated into sympathy for whoever, probably the parents, had tried to kill the creature. The child shifted its grip on him, and where the flippers had been Howard felt a sharp, stinging pain that quickly turned to agony as it was exposed to the air. Several huge, gaping sores on his arm were already running with blood and pus.</p><p>It took a moment for Howard to connect the sores with the child, and by then the leg flippers were already pressed against his stomach, and the arm flippers already gripped his chest. The sores on the child's flippers were not sores; they were powerful suction devices that gripped Howard's skin so tightly that it ripped away when the contact was broken. He tried to pry the child off, but no sooner was one flipper free than it found a new place to hold even as Howard struggled to break the grip of another.</p><p>What had begun as an act of charity had now become an intense struggle. This was not a child, Howard realized. Children could not hang on so tightly, and the creature had teeth that snapped at his hands and arms whenever they came near enough. A human face, certainly, but not a human being. Howard threw himself against the wall, hoping to stun the creature so it would drop away. It only clung tighter, and the sores where it hung on him hurt more. But at last Howard pried and scraped it off by levering it against the edge of the toilet stall. It dropped to the ground, and Harold backed quickly away, on fire with the pain of a dozen or more stinging wounds.</p><p>It had to be a nightmare. In the middle of the night, in a bathroom lighted by a single bulb, with a travesty of humanity writhing on the floor, Howard could not believe that it had any reality.</p><p>Could it be a mutation that had somehow lived? Yet the thing had far more purpose, far more control of its body than any human infant. The baby slithered across the floor as Howard, in pain from the wounds on his body, watched in a panic of indecision. The baby reached the wall and cast a flipper onto it. The suction held and the baby began to inch its way straight up the wall. As it climbed, it defecated, a thin drool of green tracing down the wall behind it. Howard looked at the slime following the infant up the wall, looked at the pus-covered sores on his arms.</p><p>What if the animal, whatever it was, did not die soon of its terrible deformity? What if it lived? What if it were found, taken to a hospital, cared for? What if it became an adult?</p><p>It reached the ceiling and made the turn, clinging tightly to the plaster, not falling off as it hung upside down and inched across toward the light bulb.</p><p>The thing was trying to get directly over Howard, and the defecation was still dripping. Loathing overcame fear, and Howard reached up, took hold of the baby from the back, and, using his full weight, was finally able to pry it off the ceiling. It writhed and twisted in his hands, trying to get the suction cups on him, but Howard resisted with all his strength and was able to get the baby, this time headfirst, into the toilet bowl. He held it there until the bubbles stopped and it was blue. Then he went back to his apartment for a knife. Whatever the creature was, it had to disappear from the face of the earth. It had to die, and there had to be no sign left that could hint that Howard had killed it.</p><p>He found the knife quickly, but paused for a few moments to put something on his wounds. They stung bitterly, but in a while they felt better. Howard took off his shirt; thought a moment and took off all his clothes, then put on his bathrobe and took a towel with him as he returned to the bathroom. He didn't want to get any blood o...</p></p><h2>Why Shoot a Butler? (Country House Mysteries, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>A <em> New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> Bestseller!</strong></p><p>"Miss Heyer's characters and dialogue are an abiding delight to me." &#x2015;Dorothy L. Sayers</p><p><em><strong>Every family has secrets, but the Fountains' are turning deadly?</strong></em></p><p>On a dark night, along a lonely country road, barrister Frank Amberley stops to help a young lady in distress and discovers a sports car with a corpse behind the wheel. The girl protests her innocence, and Amberley believes her?at least until he gets drawn into the mystery and the clues incriminating Shirley Brown begin to add up?</p><p>In an English country-house murder mystery with a twist, it's the butler who's the victim, every clue complicates the puzzle, and the bumbling police are well-meaning but completely baffled. Fortunately, in ferreting out a desperate killer, amateur sleuth Amberley is as brilliant as he is arrogant, but this time he's not sure he wants to know the truth?</p><p>PRAISE FOR WHY SHOOT A BUTLER?<br> "If genteel mysteries are your cup of tea, you have here a steaming teapot just waiting to be poured."&#x2015; <strong>Bestsellers<br> </strong>"Georgette Heyer is second to none."&#x2015; <strong>Sunday Times<br> </strong>"Heyer is an author to read ? this means you!"&#x2015;<strong>New York Herald Tribune<br> </strong>"Sharp, clear, and witty"&#x2015; <strong>New Yorker</strong></p></p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, published when she was 19, was an instant success. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her work included Regency novels, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.<br><p>The signpost was unhelpful. Some faint characters on one of its blistered arms informed the seeker after knowledge that Lumsden lay to the west, reached, presumably, at the end of a dubious-looking lane. The other arm indicated the direction of Pittingly, a place Mr<br> Amberley had never heard of. However, if Lumsden lay to the west, Upper Nettlefold o ught to be found somewhere in the direction of the obscure Pittingly. Mr Amberley<br> switched off his spot-lamp, and swung the car round, reflecting savagely that he should have known better than to have trusted to his cousin Felicity's enthusiastic but incomplete directions. If he had had the sense to follow the usual road he would have been at Greythorne by now. As it was, Felicity's 'short way' had already made him late for dinner.</p> <p>He drove on rather cautiously down a bumpy lane flanked by quickset hedges. Wreaths of autumn mist curled across the road and further exasperated him. He passed a road winding off to the left, but it looked unpromising, and he bore on towards Pittingly. </p> <p>The lane twisted and turned its way through the Weald. There were apparently no houses on it, nor did Pittingly &#x2014; a place towards which Mr Amberley was fast developing an acute dislike &#x2014; materialise. He glanced at his watch and swore gently. It was already some minutes after eight. He pressed his foot down on the accelerator and the long powerful Bentley shot forward, bounding over the rough surface in a way that was very bad for Mr Amberley's temper. Pittingly seemed to be destined to remain a mystery; no<br> sign of any village greeted Mr Amberley's rather hard grey eyes, but round a sharp bend in the lane a red tail-light came into view.</p> <p>As the Bentley drew closer its headlights, piercing the mist, picked out a motionless figure standing in the road beside the stationary car. The car, Mr Amberley observed, was a closed Austin Seven. It was drawn up to the side of the road, its engine switched off, and only its side and tail-lights burning. He slackened speed and saw that the still figure in the road was not that of a man, as he had at first supposed, but of a female, dressed in a belted raincoat with a felt hat pulled low over her forehead.</p> <p>Mr Amberley brought his Bentley to a standstill alongside the little Austin and leaned across the vacant seat beside him. </p> <p>'Is anything wrong?' he said, not without a touch of impatience. Really, if on the top of having lost his way he was going to have to change a wheel or peer into the bowels of<br> the Austin's engine, it would be the crowning annoyance.The girl &#x2014; he guessed rather than saw that she was quite young &#x2014; did not move. She was standing by the off door of the Austin with her hands thrust into the pockets of her raincoat. 'No, nothing,' she said. Her voice was deep. He got the impression that something was wrong, but he had not<br> the smallest desire to discover the cause of the underlying agitation in her curt words.</p> <p>'Then can you tell me if I'm on the right road for Greythorne?' he asked.</p> <p>'I don't know,' she said ungraciously.</p> <p>A somewhat sardonic gleam shot into Mr Amberley's eyes. 'A stranger to these parts yourself, no doubt?' </p> <p>She moved her head and he saw her face for a moment, a pale oval with a mouth he thought sulky. 'Yes, I am. Practically. Anyway, I've never heard of Greythorne. Good night.'</p> <p>This was pointed enough, but Mr Amberley ignored it. His own manners were, his family informed him, abrupt to the point of rudeness, and the girl's surliness rather pleased<br> him. 'Tax your brain a little further,' he requested. 'Do you know the way to Upper Nettlefold?'</p> <p>The brim of her hat threw a shadow over her eyes, but he was sure that she glowered at him. 'You ought to have taken a turning to the left about a mile back,' she informed him.<br> 'Damn!' said Mr Amberley. 'Thanks.' He sat back in his seat and took out the clutch. To turn the car in this narrow lane was not easy. He drove on till he was clear of the Austin and began his manoeuvres. After considerable trouble he got the Bentley round, its head-lamps illuminating the girl and the Austin in two brilliant shafts of light. As the car swung round she flinched, as though the sudden blaze of light startled her.</p> <p>Mr Amberley saw her face, chalk-white, for a moment before she averted it. Instead of straightening up the car he kept it stationary, his foot hard on the clutch, his hand mechanically grasping the gear-lever. The headlights were directed full into the smaller car and showed Mr Amberley something queer. There was a small hole in the windscreen, with splinters radiating out from it in a star shape. He leaned forward over the wheel, staring. 'Who's in that car?' he said sharply.</p> <p>The girl moved quickly, shutting the interior of the Austin from Mr Amberley's keen scrutiny. 'What has it got to do with you?' she said breathlessly. 'I've told you the way to<br> Upper Nettlefold. Why don't you go?</p> <p>Mr Amberley pushed the gear-lever into neutral and put on his brake. He got out of the car and strode towards the girl. Now that he was close to her he saw that she was goodlooking, a fact that did not interest him, and exceedingly nervous, a fact that aroused all his suspicions.</p> <p>'Very silent, your companion?' he said grimly. 'Get away from that door.'<br> She stood her ground, but she was obviously frightened.</p> <p>'Will you please go? You have no business to molest me in this fashion!'</p> <p>His hand shot out and grasped her wrist. He jerked her somewhat roughly away from the door and peered in. A man was sitting in the driver's seat, curiously immobile. His head was sunk on his chest. He did not look up or speak.</p> <p>The girl's hand shook in Mr Amberley's hold, which had slowly tightened on it. The figure at the wheel did not move.</p> <p>'Oh!' said Mr Amberley. 'I see.'</p> <p>'Let me go!' she said fiercely. 'I &#x2014; it &#x2014; I didn't do it.'</p> <p>He retained his grasp on her wrist, but he was looking at the dead man. The clothing, a dark lounge suit, was disarranged, as though someone had rifled the pockets; the striped shirt was stained with red, and a dark stain ran down the front of the waistcoat.</p> <p>Mr Amberley put out his free hand to touch the slack one inside the car. He did not appear to feel any repulsion. 'Not cold,' he said. 'Well?'</p> <p>'If you think I did it you're wrong,' she said. 'I found him like it. I tell you I wasn't even here!'</p> <p>He ran his hand down over her coat, feeling for a possible weapon. She began to struggle, but found that she was quite powerless in his grip. His hand encountered something hard in the right pocket. Without ceremony he pulled out a small automatic. She stood still. </p> <p>Hatred vibrated in her voice as she said:<br> 'If you take the trouble to inspect it you will find it's fully loaded. The magazine holds seven. It isn't cocked.'</p> <p>'Are you in the habit of carrying loaded guns?' he inquired.</p> <p>'That's my affair.'</p> <p>'Undoubtedly,' he agreed, and lifting the gun sniffed gingerly at the end of the barrel. He let go her wrist and slipped out the magazine. As she had said, it held seven cartridges. Pulling back the breech, he satisfied himself that it was empty. Then he snapped the magazine home and handed the gun to the girl.</p> <p>She took it in a somewhat unsteady clasp. 'Thanks. Satisfied I didn't do it?'</p> <p>'Quite satisfied that you didn't do it with that gun,' he replied. 'Probably you didn't do the actual shooting, but you know something about it.'</p> <p>'You're wrong. I don't know anything. He was like that when I found him.'</p> <p>'Dead?'</p> <p>'No &#x2014; yes, I mean.'</p> <p>'Make up your mind which it is to be,' he recommended.<br> 'Damn you, leave me alone!' she flashed. 'Can't you see I'm upset and don't know what I'm saying?'</p> <p>His cool glance swept over her. 'Since you put it like that; no, I can't. You seem to me remarkably self-possessed. Come on, out with it! Was the man dead when you found him?'</p></p><h2>United States History and Geography, Student Edition (UNITED STATES HISTORY (HS))</h2><p>United States History &amp; Geography explores the history of our nation and brings the past to life for today&#x2019;s high school students.

After accomplishing this, he first worked as a consultant for American Institutes for Research and then joined academia. His first position was as a member of the Department of Management at the Terry College of Business, University of Georgia. As has been indicative of his well planned career, Bob thought that he would stay at Terry for maybe five years because it would only take a few years for a smart person with three liberal arts degrees to get used to business schools and then move on to bigger and better things. Thirty-four years later, he decided that maybe it was time to move on. During these years, Bob climbed the academic ranks from assistant to full professor and pursued an administrative career at Terry as a department chair and associate dean in the College of Business. Bob was also elected to five executive positions, including President, within the Human Resources Division of the Academy of Management. In 2005, Bob moved to the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University as the Director of the Executive MBA Program. In 2008 he moved to Denver, Colorado when his wife Chris became Dean of the Daniels School of Business at the University of Denver. He had the good sense to retire from faculty life at that point. As a consultant, Bob has worked with a number of companies; PPG Industries, Westinghouse, BellSouth, and Ford for example.<br><br>Hubert S.

This powerful software guides you through the process from beginning to end, giving you the practical and legal information you need to make the best decisions for you and your family. <br> <i>Quicken Willmaker &amp; Trust 2020 </i> includes: <br><ul> <li> A customized estate plan, including a will, revocable living trust (individual and shared), health care directive, durable power of attorney for finances, and other essential documents </li><li> An easy-to-use interview format that lets you complete documents at your own pace </li><li> A user-friendly legal manual to answer common questions </li><li> A team of lawyer-editors working to ensure each document reflects the laws of your state* <br></li></ul> <i>Quicken Willmaker &amp; Trust 2020 </i> is the original will-writing software, created and updated regularly by Nolo&#x2019;s experts. Free legal updates will keep your program current through 2020. Technical support is also available. <br> Here&#x2019;s more about the documents you can make with <i>Quicken Willmaker &amp; Trust 2020 </i>: <p> <b>Your Will:</b> The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a &#x201c;personal representative&#x201d;) to carry out your wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. With <i>Quicken Willmaker &amp; Trust 2020 </i>, you can revise and update your will whenever you like. </p><p> <b>Living Trust:</b> Use a living trust to help your estate avoid probate after you die. Like a will, a living trust distributes property to the people you name. But unlike a will, property that passes through a living trust can be passed directly to your beneficiaries, without waiting for court approval -- saving your beneficiaries time and money. With <i>Quicken Willmaker &amp; Trust 2020 </i> living trust, you can make an individual trust or make a shared trust with your spouse. You can also use the program to create revocations of trust (if you want to end your trust) and certifications of trust (so that you don&#x2019;t have to show your entire trust to financial institutions). You can also use the trust restatement to update your trust as often as you like, without needing to retitle your property. </p><p> <b>Your Health Care Directive:</b> Spare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care (living will) and naming someone to carry out your instructions (power of attorney for health care). </p><p> <b>Your Durable Power of Attorney for Finances:</b> A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your "agent" or "attorney-in-fact") will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. </p><p> <b>Your Final Arrangements:</b>Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more. </p><p> <b>Documents for Your Executor:</b>Make sure your executor has all the forms and instructions necessary to do the job: checklists, letters, notices and claim forms. </p><p> <b>Information for Caregivers and Survivors:</b> Organize your information so that your survivors don't have to. Use these documents to give them details about everything from bank accounts, to passwords, to the names of people you'd like contacted in the event of your illness or death. </p><p> <b>Letter to Survivors:</b>Use the Letter to Survivors to leave your loved ones detailed explanations about your decisions. For example, you may want to let them know why you made certain gifts or named a particular person to be your executor. You can also use your letter to leave some general thoughts about your life. </p><p> <b>Personal Finance Documents:</b> Over a dozen forms let you handle common financial situations, such as lending or borrowing money between friends or family, creating a bill of sale, and closing a credit card account. </p><p> <b>Home &amp; Family Documents:</b>Practical forms you can use every day to help run your home and keep your family safe, including authorizations and agreements, promissory notes, limited powers of attorney, and child and elder care forms. </p><p> <b>BONUS</b>: With <i>Quicken Willmaker &amp; Trust 2020 </i> you also get the e-book <i>Special Needs Trust: Protect Your Child's Financial Future</i>. Learn how to provide for a loved one with special needs without jeopardizing government benefits.

Written for mothers and fathers, obstetricians, nurses, midwives, scientists, insurance professionals, and anyone contemplating having a child, this passionate expos� documents how, in the most expensive maternity care system in the world, women have lost control over childbirth and what the disturbing results of this phenomenon have been. <i>Born in the USA </i>examines issues including midwifery and the safety of out-of-hospital birth, how the process of becoming a doctor can adversely affect both practitioners and their patients, and why there has been a rise in the use of risky but doctor-friendly interventions, including the use of Cytotec, a drug that has not been approved by the FDA for pregnant women. Most importantly, this gripping investigation, supported by many troubling personal stories, explores how women can reclaim the childbirth experience for the betterment of themselves and their children.<br><br><i>Born in the USA </i>tells:<br><br><b>* Why women are 70% more likely to die in childbirth in America than in Europe<br><br>* What motivates obstetricians to use dangerous and unnecessary drugs and procedures<br><br>* How the present malpractice crisis has been aggravated by the fear of accountability<br><br>* Why procedures such as cesarean section and birth inductions are so readily used</b></p><p>"Dr. Wagner depicts the state of obstetrical care in the United States with clarity and accuracy.

This book is an introduction to the Morrigan and several related goddesses who share the title, including Badb and Macha. It combines solid academic information with personal experience in a way that is intended to dispel the confusion that often surrounds who this goddess was and is. The Morrigan is as active in the world today as she ever was in the past but answering her call means answering the challenge of finding her history and myth in a sea of misinformation, supposition, and hard-to-find ancient texts. Here in one place, all of her basic information has been collected along with personal experiences and advice from a long-time priestess dedicated to a goddess who bears the title Morrigan.</p><p>&nbsp;Morgan is an Irish Re-constructionist with Heathen tendencies who has been a polytheist since the early '90&#x2032;s. &nbsp;A wandering priestess of Odin and dedicant of Macha, she teaches classes on Irish and Norse magical practices, fairies, and related subjects around the northeastern United States. Morgan's writing has appeared in a variety of magazines and anthologies including 'By Blood, Bone, and Blade: A Tribute to the Morrigan'&nbsp;and 'Naming the Goddess'. Morgan is also the author of nine books including 'Fairy Witchcraft'&nbsp;and the urban fantasy novel 'Murder Between the Worlds'"Morgan has created a fascinating and endlessly useful volume for anyone who has either been called by or is seeking the Morrigan. This book combines serious academic research with deeply personal experience to build a balanced yet evocative image of this Irish goddess. A brilliant read for anyone interested in Celtic spirituality but absolutely essential for anyone studying the Morrigan and her sisters." -&nbsp;Mabh Savage, author of A Modern Celt: Seeking the Ancestors<br><br>"Morgan presents us with solid, well-researched information on the Irish Morrigans from some of the best academic sources out there, and does it in a way that is engaging and approachable." -&nbsp;Segom�ros Widugeni, previously known as Aedh Rua, author of Celtic Flame: An Insider's Guide to Irish Pagan Tradition<br><br>"There are so many faces of this amazing goddess and Daimler brings them together in a very readable way that enchanted me into turning page after page." -&nbsp;Elen Sentier, author of Elen of the Ways and Trees of the Goddess</p><h2>Be Transformed: The Healing Power of the Sacraments</h2><p><p><b>Winner of a 2018 Catholic Press Association Award: Sacraments.

In this follow-up to his bestselling <i>Be Healed</i>, Bob Schuchts explains how the sacraments can fuel your emotional and spiritual healing and bring you closer to God.</p><p>Based on more than thirty-five years of experience as a therapist and decades spent in parish ministry, Schuchts demonstrates how each of the seven sacraments can be a life-changing encounter with Christ, communicated through the power of the Holy Spirit. He pairs each healing sacrament with one of the seven deadly wounds that emanated from original sin in the Garden of Eden. We perpetuate and deepen those wounds each time we sin, but the sacraments are God&#x2019;s remedy for sin. They give us a way to restore us to wholeness in Christ.</p><p>In <i>Be Transformed</i>, You&#x2019;ll discover how each sacrament can help you heal from wounds that can impede your relationships and sense of self-worth. With Schuchts&#x2019;s help, you&#x2019;ll learn how:</p><ul><li>Baptism makes us beloved children of God, healing our wounds of rejection</li><li>Holy Communion heals our wounds of abandonment by inviting us to share in Jesus&#x2019; abiding presence</li><li>Confirmation overcomes our powerlessness through the power of the Holy Spirit</li><li>Holy Orders heals wounds of confusion and disorder by re-establishing God&#x2019;s authority in our lives</li><li>In marriage, God&#x2019;s faithful love heals wounds of fear and mistrust</li><li>Reconciliation restores purity and releases us from shame</li><li>Anointing of the Sick provides enduring hope to overcome our hopelessness</li></ul><p><i>Be Transformed </i>offers all of the tools you need for a fresh understanding of the sacraments, including reflection questions, scripture meditations, prayers, and inspiring stories.

After receiving his doctorate in family relations from Florida State University in 1981, Schuchts began teaching and counseling. While in private practice, Schuchts also taught graduate and undergraduate courses at Florida State and Tallahassee Community College. Schuchts later served on faculty at the Theology of the Body Institute and at the Center for Biblical Studies, where he taught courses on healing, sexuality, and marriage.

In doing so, you come to understand your true identity in Christ.&nbsp;After reading this book, you will realize that your deepest longings are themselves a longing for the sacraments." --<b>Christopher West, </b>Founder and president of<i> The Cor Project</i>, Cofounder of the Theology of the Body Institute&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> "For many people, the sacraments stand at a distance as a formality to the Christian life. Not fully understanding the ministry of Christ, the apostles, and the Church over the past two thousand years, many are unaware of what and who the sacraments really are and the powerful role they play in the life God designed for each of us. In this book, Bob Schuchts has recaptured the meaning and beauty of the sacraments and the powerful work of Christ through them. <i>Be Transformed</i> is a book that will stand the test of time and truly transform people&#x2019;s lives. This book has renewed my faith in Christ and the Church and instilled in me a new vigor for the sacraments, and I'm certain it will for you!" --<b>Paul George</b>, Founder of Adore Ministries&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> "This book helped me understand sacramental life in the Church in new ways with every passing chapter. Over the years, I have been profoundly impacted and led into healing by Bob Schuchts and his ministry--this book is, naturally, a continuation of that. As a convert to the Catholic faith who struggles with scrupulosity, my eyes are still opening to the goodness and abundant grace of the sacraments. Schuchts is intersecting sacramental theology, which can sometimes be approached hyper-academically, with the dedication to the inner healing work of the Spirit. This book has been a gift to my life!" --<b>Audrey Assad</b>, Catholic singer, songwriter, and musician<br> &nbsp;<br> "What a beautifully simple and transforming book! Sadly, many Catholics don't understand and, more importantly, don't experience the full grace and power contained in the sacraments. God desires to transform, heal, and make holy his people, and he so often chooses to bring this about in the sacraments of the Church. With each sacrament, Bob Schuchts marvelously reveals the often-unseen healing grace contained within the sacraments. He goes on to show that this grace is present for all people who open their hearts to receive it." --<b>Rev. Dave Pivonka, T.O.R., </b>Author of&nbsp;<i>Breath of God</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i>"Be Transformed</i>&nbsp;offers a fresh and original way of understanding the ancient Catholic tradition that the sacraments heal the wounds of fallen human nature. In a world where so many have experienced deep hurts, this book is exactly what is needed! Through personal testimonies and clear explanations, Schuchts shows how every one of the sacraments can be the means of a personal encounter with the Lord Jesus, the physician of our souls and bodies." --<b>Mary Healy</b>, Author of&nbsp;<i>Men and Women Are from Eden</i><br><br> "Bob Schuchts has masterfully illumined the healing and restorative power of the sacraments--these transforming rivers of grace that bring us into the abundant life.

I like the way that Gardner walks students through a visual analysis after first elaborating on the historical context. I think this is the textbook's greatest strength."<br><br>"One of the most outstanding differences [between Gardner's and other art history texts] is the accessibility of the text.

The Vajkays&#x2014;call them Mother and Father&#x2014;live in S�rszeg, a dead-end burg in the provincial heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Father retired some years ago to devote his days to genealogical research and quaint questions of heraldry. Mother keeps house. Both are utterly enthralled with their daughter, Skylark. Unintelligent, unimaginative, unattractive, and unmarried, Skylark cooks and sews for her parents and anchors the unremitting tedium of their lives.<br> <br>Now Skylark is going away, for one week only, it&#x2019;s true, but a week that yawns endlessly for her parents. What will they do? Before they know it, they are eating at restaurants, reconnecting with old friends, attending the theater. And this is just a prelude to Father&#x2019;s night out at the Panther Club, about which the less said the better. Drunk, in the light of dawn Father surprises himself and Mother with his true, buried, unspeakable feelings about Skylark.<br> <br>Then, Skylark is back. Is there a world beyond the daily grind and life's creeping disappointments? Kosztol�nyi&#x2019;s crystalline prose, perfect comic timing, and profound human sympathy conjure up a tantalizing beauty that lies on the far side of the irredeemably ordinary. To that extent, <i>Skylark</i> is nothing less than a magical book.</p><p>Dezso Kosztol�nyi (1885-1936) was born in Subotica, a provincial Austro-Hungarian city (located in present-day Serbia) that would serve as the model for the fictional town in which he later set several novels, including <i>Skylark</i>. His father was the headmaster of the local gymnasium, which he attended until he was expelled for insubordination. Kosztol�nyi spent three years studying Hungarian and German at the University of Budapest, but quit in 1906 to go into journalism. In 1908 he was among the first contributors to the legendary literary journal Nyugat; in 1910, the publication of his second collection of poems, <i>The Complaints of a Poor Little Chil</i>d, caused a literary sensation. Kosztol�nyi turned from poetry to fiction in the 1920s, when he wrote the novels <i>Nero, the Bloody Poet</i> (to which Thomas Mann contributed a preface); <i>Skylark</i>; and <i>Anna Edes</i>. An influential critic and, in 1931, the first president of the Hungarian PEN Club, Kosztol�nyi was also celebrated as the translator of such varied writers as Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, Oscar Wilde, Verlaine, Baudelaire, Goethe, and Rilke, as well as for his anthology of Chinese and Japanese poetry. He was married to the actress Ilona Harmos and had one son.<br><br>Richard Aczel teaches English literature at the University of Cologne, Germany.

With this intelligent and insightful primer, he sets out to help art students master the art of painting the heavens.<br>One of the first books of its kind, Sloane's guide to drawing clouds and sunsets does much more than teach you how to draw. Before the sketching even begins, he describes various kinds of clouds &#x2014; cumulus, stratus, cirrus, and other formations &#x2014; and offers homespun techniques that add texture and realism to cloud illustrations.<br>Also discussed and illustrated are skies as accessories and basic subject matter within a sketch, the shape and anatomy of clouds, moods and shadows in cloud formations, and incorporating clouds within a sunset.</p><p>Sloane, born in New York City and educated at Yale, most of his life has been spent in New England, where he has combined a fascinating range of interests into a colorful and highly successful career, primarily as author-illustrator of more than 24 books on American history, arts, and artifacts.</p><h2>Experiments in Physical Chemistry</h2><p>This best-selling comprehensive laboratory textbook includes experiments with background theoretical information, safety recommendations, and computer applications.

Its municipal early childhood system has been recognized and acclaimed as one of the best systems of education in the world (<i>Newsweek</i>, December 2, 1991). Over the past 30 years, the system has evolved a distinctive and innovative set of philosophical assumptions, curriculum and pedagogy; method of school organization; and design environments which, taken as a unified whole, is called the Reggio Emilia approach. This approach fosters children's intellectual development through systematic focus on symbolic representation, as children are encouraged to explore their environment and express themselves through words, movement, drawing, painting, playing, and other natural modes of expression. <i>The Hundred Languages of Children</i> offers a comprehensive exploration of the Reggio Emilia approach. It provides a unique forum in which noted Italian and North American educators and administrators who are involved in or studying the program examine its origins, explain its rationale and practice, and demonstrate how its principles can be applied in American classrooms. ... This volume deserves careful reading, for it dispels the prevailing view of Reggio as an art-education curriculum and casts it as a comprehensive child development program. ... a comfortable, stimulating thought journey ...<i> -Carol Brunson Phillips, Executive Director, Council for Early Childhood Professional Recognition, Washington, D.C.</i></p><p></p><p>... a remarkable collection of essays which provide the reader with a much more thorough understanding of this approach to the education of young children ...

What are the rules for keeping kosher? How do I light the Hanukah candles? What is in the Hebrew Bible? What do the Jewish holidays signify? What should I be teaching my children about being Jewish?<br> <br>With the first edition of <i>Essential Judaism,</i> George Robinson offered the world the accessible compendium that he sought when he rediscovered his Jewish identity as an adult. In his &#x201c;ambitious and all-inclusive&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>) guide, Robinson illuminates the Jewish life cycle at every stage and lays out many fascinating aspects of the religion&#x2014;the Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism, the evolution of Hasidism, and much more&#x2014;while keeping a firm focus on the different paths to living a good Jewish life in today&#x2019;s world.<br> <br>Now, a decade and a half later, Robinson has updated this valuable introductory text with information on topics including denominational shifts, same-sex marriage, the intermarriage debate, transgender Jews, the growth of anti-Semitism, and the changing role of women in worship, along with many other hotly debated topics in the contemporary Jewish world and beyond.<br> <br>The perfect gift for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah or anyone thinking about conversion&#x2014;this is the ultimate companion for anyone interested in learning more about Judaism, the kind of book its readers will revisit over and over for years to come.</p><p><i>Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs and Rituals</i> is a brief but comprehensive layman's handbook to Jewish prayer, worship, festivals, customs, history, language, philosophy, and ideology. Its author, George Robinson, returned to synagogue after a 20-year absence and found himself utterly confused about the basics of his religion, despite having attended Hebrew school. He looked far and wide for a reference work that would help him get his bearings but did not find one; so he wrote one himself. Robinson's background as a journalist proved to be an asset in this project, which shows evidence of much detective work, the results of which are plainly described and clearly organized. Robinson is sensitive to the many perspectives of contemporary Judaism without being mealy-mouthed. His work is a triumph of diplomacy and clear thinking; his overview of Hebrew Scripture, and his excellent Kosher primer, would be worth the price of this book in themselves.George Robinson is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Essential Judaism</i>, as well as <i>Essential Torah: A Complete Guide to the Five Books of Moses</i> (2006). The recipient of a Simon Rockower Award for excellence in Jewish journalism from the American Jewish Press Association, Robinson is a senior writer for <i>The Jewish Week</i>, the largest Jewish newspaper in North America. He is a contributor to the new edition of <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i> and has written frequently for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Newsday</i>, and <i>Hadassah Magazine.</i></p><h2>Hard Times (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p><p>"My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else," proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a "fanatic of the demonstrable fact," who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.<br>Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime.

[and] most entertaining.1;2;Conor Cruise O7;Brien, "New Republic"<br>During the 120 years covered by this book, the Scots, Welsh, English, and to some extent the Irish began to think of themselves as Britons. Many forces combined to create this new identity in the minds of these people. One of the most important was the almost-constant warfare against France, and hence the need for protected shipping made British identity an economic advantage for the Scots. Fear of invasion and the need for soldiers helped expand the roles of ordinary men and women and at the same time increased their feelings of patriotism. Colley has reinterpreted some old theories and offers evidence to support her views. She also shows that some changes that seem to have been sudden actually were part of the logical progression of these early movements.

George Gheverghese Joseph takes us on a breathtaking multicultural tour of the roots and shoots of non-European mathematics. He shows us the deep influence the Egyptians and Babylonians had on the Greeks; the Arabs' major creative contributions; and the astounding range of successes of the great civilizations of India and China. This challenging and erudite book questions familiar assumptions and enlarges our sense of what we mean by mathematics.</p></p><p>When we hear that mathematics is both the most noble endeavor of our species and that it was born in Europe, we naturally tend to be suspicious. Few writers could be as well-qualified to write about ancient math across the world as George Gheverghese Joseph, whose <i>The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics</i> is a bright example of clear exposition and argument. Though the topic might intimidate those averse to mathematics, history, non-Western cultures, or some combination thereof, the book is essential for any reader who seeks a clearer understanding of any one of those. Joseph doesn't make things easy for nonmathematicians or nonhistorians, but the pleasure of meeting his challenge is robust. He explains ancient African, American, and Asian methods of counting and manipulating numbers with ease, paying particular attention to the historical development of and interrelationships between cultures. When discussing systems of mathematics as complex as those taught in ancient India and China, Joseph includes sample problems and discussions to help the interested student see numbers as past learners did. The revised edition includes a lengthy section, titled "Reflections," that updates and expands much of the material. Few readers will be able to match Joseph's grasp of both history and mathematics, but all will find <i>The Crest of the Peacock</i> as delightful and elegant as its subjects. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>George Gheverghese Joseph </b>was born in Kerala, southern India, and lived in India for nine years. His family then moved to Mombassa in Kenya, where he received his schooling. He studied at the University of Leicester, and later at the University of Manchester, where he completed his postgraduate studies. He has worked in various occupations that have taken him to places all over the world, including East and Central Africa, India, Papua New Guinea, and South East Asia.</p><h2>How to Teach the Bible</h2><p>The author was conducting a workshop for teachers in a church and was handed a note by a young woman in the workshop. The note read, I have never taught anything or anyone . . . I don&#39;t know how to begin to prepare. Can you help? Dr. Coleman meets scores of teachers just like the young woman. He indicates there are men and women who are doing their best, but who have serious doubts about their adequacy as teachers of the Bible. Wherever you meet them, they ask these same questions: How can I learn enough about the Bible to have something worth sharing with my class? How can I get the members of my class involved in the lessons, so I won&#39;t have to do all the talking? How do you get people interested, when they seem so indifferent to Bible study? Is there any way to get the class members to study their lessons? How do you lead class members to do something about the message of the Bible, other than just sit there and discuss it? Where can I find out more about teaching methods? How do you prepare a teaching plan? These workers care deeply about Bible teaching. They want to do a good job. But they don&#39;t quite know how to go about it. And that explains the reason for this book. Dr. Coleman integrates theory and practice in a how-to-do-it book which combines discussions of teaching with skill-building exercises. He brings the elements of a Bible teacher&#39;s conference to the individual who has had no opportunity to attend such a conference. At the same time, the book may also be used as a textbook for teacher-training workshops.</p><p></p><h2>Jane Austen: The Complete Works 7-Book Boxed Set: Sense and Sensibility; Pride and Prejudice; Mansfield Park; Emma; Northanger Abbey; Persuasion; Love ... boxed set) (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p>Few novelists have conveyed the subtleties and nuances of their own social milieu with the wit and insight of Jane Austen. Through her vivacious and spirited heroines and their circle, she painted vivid portraits of English middle-class life as the eighteenth century came to a close. Each of these novels is a love story and a story about marriage&#x2014;marriage for love, for financial security, for social status. But they are not mere romances. Ironic, comic, and wise, they are masterly studies of the society Austen observed. The seven books in this box set&#x2014;Sense and Sensibility,&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, and&nbsp;Love and Freindship&nbsp;(early writings and juvenilia)&#x2014;contain some of the most brilliant, dazzling prose in the English language.&nbsp;Part of Penguin&#x2019;s beautiful Hardcover Classics series, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith, these delectable and collectible editions are bound in high-quality, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design.</p><p><b>Jane Austen</b>&nbsp;was born on 16 December 1775 at Steventon, near Basingstoke, the seventh child of the rector of the parish.

The answer is, just the paper clip. Magnets only pick up things that contain bits of iron. In this new addition to the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science series, veteran author Franklyn Branley explains the properties and behavior of magnets. True Kelley's charming illustrations will entertain readers as they discover for themselves what makes a magnet. Hands-on activities include making a magnet and compass. <p></p></p><p><p>Franklyn M.

In the tradition of his acclaimed warship design history series. Norman Friedman describes the forces technical, political, and operational that shaped a vital element of U.S. sea power. For example, he examines the evolution in missions, such as forward-based antisubmarine warfare and strategic deterrence, that transformed the submarine from its former subsidiary role to the center of national power. U.S. Submarines since 1945 is also the story of a technological revolution: first the emergence of fast diesel-electric craft, then the shock of nuclear power, followed by the appearance of submarine-launched strategic missiles. Nowhere else can a reader find so complete or sophisticated an account of the development of the U.S. submarine force, including not only the hulls but also the weapons and sensors they carry. The book details what submarines were ordered, what weapons and propulsion systems they had, how they performed, and what sonars and combat systems were developed.<br>This volume also publicly reveals for the first time several important proposals for unrealized and generally unknown submarine projects. Drawing heavily on interviews with members of the submarine community. Friedman examines a radically changing defense environment. His detailed and authoritative study also takes a look at the effects posed by the end of the Cold War on the role and construction of submarine fleets. The book explores the challenges involved in the often necessary reinvention of a submarine to meet current and projected needs. The author compares the technical requirements of submarines versus surface ships and discusses the importance of maintaining a submarine industrial base in the face of post-Cold War reductions.</p><p></p><h2>Patient Care in Radiography: With an Introduction to Medical Imaging</h2><p><p>Learn the technical and interpersonal skills you need to care for radiography patients! <b>Patient Care in Radiography with an Introduction to Medical Imaging, 9th Edition</b> provides illustrated, step-by-step instructions for a wide range of patient procedures and imaging modalities.

Published as medical books while he was teaching anatomy and dissection at the University of Padua, they include the <i>Tabulae Sex </i>(1538), intended as an aid to students; the magnificently illustrated <i>De Humani Corporis Fabrica</i> (1543), and the companion volume, the <i>Epitome </i>(1543). Individually, these books are milestones in the history of medicine. They also offer one of the most magnificent collections of anatomical drawings ever published. The plates were executed with such vitality and originality that they have been attributed to the most talented illustrators of the sixteenth century, not to mention Vesalius himself. Many of the drawings, in fact, were products of Titian's famous atelier. <br>For this&nbsp;edition of the Vesalius illustrations, Dover has combined the best existing plates and text. The illustrations have been reproduced from the sumptuous (1934) Munich edition of Vesalius titled <i>Icones Anatomicae</i>. The Munich plates were struck for the most part from the original wood blocks then in the collection of the Library of the University of Munich. These priceless art objects were destroyed in the bombing of Munich during World War II. Aside from the&nbsp;original copies of the woodcuts (of which only a few complete sets are known), the Munich restrikes are the best representations of the Vesalian anatomical drawings, for they preserve much of the freshness and richness of the 1543 edition. <br>The text of this Dover edition has been faithfully reproduced from an edition of Vesalius published by World Publishing Company in 1950. The&nbsp;editors, distinguished authorities on sixteenth-century medicine, have provided a very comprehensive history of Vesalius, his career, and excellent explanations of the legends surrounding the illustrators, artists, and publishers involved with the production of his books. No other source will provide the general reader, bibliophile, art historian, artist, or historian of science and&nbsp;medicine with such complete data on Vesalius and his fabulous anatomical illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>How to Read the Bible Book by Book: A Guided Tour</h2><p><p>Reading the Bible need not be a haphazard journey through strange and bewildering territory.

In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topics.</p><p>A presentation of classical as well as recent results of matrix analysis that have proven important to applied mathematics and reflect two concurrent views of the subject."There seems little doubt that the book will become a standard reference for research workers in numerical mathematics."

Superb&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist, </i>starred review).&nbsp;<br><br>In <i>The Face of Water, </i>Sarah Ruden brilliantly and elegantly explains and celebrates the Bible&#x2019;s writings. Singling out the most famous passages, such as the Genesis creation story, the Ten Commandments, the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, and the Beatitudes, Ruden reexamines and retranslates from the Hebrew and Greek what has been obscured and misunderstood over time.&nbsp;<br><br>Making clear that she is not a Biblical scholar, cleric, theologian, or philosopher, Ruden&#x2014;a Quaker&#x2014;speaks plainly in this illuminating and inspiring book. She writes that while the Bible has always mattered profoundly, it is a book that in modern translations often lacks vitality, and she sets out here to make it less a thing of paper and glue and ink and more a live and loving text.&nbsp;<br><br>Ruden writes of the early evolution, literary beauty, and transcendent ideals of the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament, exploring how the Jews came to establish the greatest, most enduring book on earth as their regional strategic weakness found a paradoxical moral and spiritual strength through their writings, and how the Christians inherited and adapted this remarkable literary tradition. She writes as well about the crucial purposes of translation, not only for availability of texts but also for accountability in public life and as a reflection of society&#x2019;s current concerns.&nbsp;<br><br>She shows that it is the original texts that most clearly reveal our cherished values (both religious and secular), unlike the standard English translations of the Bible that mask even the yearning for freedom from slavery. The word &#x201c;redemption&#x201d; translated from Hebrew and Greek, meaning mercy for the exploited and oppressed, is more abstract than its original meaning&#x2014;to buy a person back from captivity or slavery or some other distress.&nbsp;<br> <i><br>The Face of Water&nbsp;</i>is as much a book about poetry, music, drama, raw humor, and passion as it is about the idealism of the Bible. Ruden&#x2019;s book gives us an unprecedented, nuanced understanding of what this extraordinary document was for its earliest readers and what it can still be for us today</p><p><b>SARAH RUDEN</b>&nbsp;was educated at the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins, and Harvard, from which she graduated with a Ph.D. in Classical philology. She has translated six books of Classical literature and contributed her Aeschylus&#x2019;s <i>Oresteia </i>to a collection of tragedy in English. Her translation of Augustine&#x2019;s <i>Confessions </i>was her first book-length work of sacred literature. She is also the author of a book of poetry, <i>Other Places</i>.

You happen to send the only surviving record of the event, and only through text messaging (and yes, I know this didn&#x2019;t exist in the 1980s), and only to a monolingual English speaker in White Plains, New York, who is an obsessive collector of American Girl dolls. Having gamely transmitted the abbreviated first lines of &#x201c;Nkosi Sikelel&#x2019; iAfrica&#x201d; (&#x201c;God Bless Africa&#x201d;), you get back to singing and swaying.<br><br>We don&#x2019;t get a much better record of what Psalm 137, for example, was like in its early incarnations. Here is the King James Version:<br><br>1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.<br><br>2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.<br><br>3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.<br><br>4 How shall we sing the Lord&#x2019;s song in a strange land?<br><br>5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.<br><br>6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.<br><br>7 Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.<br><br>8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.<br><br>9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.<br><br>What is this scene of lamenting and cherishing and threatening? It is so vivid and so specific that I&#x2019;m convinced it was based on direct experience. It does appear that some of the Jewish elite of the Babylonian Exile lived near Mesopotamian canals. But why exactly would you hang harps on willow trees? And why the change to a vengeful mood in verse 7? And what to make of the horrifying verse 9? Was this originally two or even three poems?<br><br>Much of this puzzlement naturally comes from the present harrowing shortage of the data that were available to early performers and their audiences. In their oldest written form, the Hebrew words represented by the English &#x201c;By the rivers of Babylon&#x201d; would have consisted of ten consonant letters (written and read from right to left) and nothing else. Original written Greek&#x2014;in a dialect of which, Koin&#x113; (&#x201c;Common&#x201d;), the whole of the New Testament was written&#x2014;is so much more decipherable: it has vowels! Early Hebrew writing didn&#x2019;t. But in both languages a short, handy phonetic alphabet, adapted from that of the Phoenicians, probably served for centuries as little more (at least in the realm of literature) than performance notes in a stubbornly oral culture.<br><br>A standard example of the gap between ancient performance and the texts and translations in their evolved forms is fifth-century b.c.e. Classical Athenian tragedy and comedy&#x2014;for which we have no original stage directions. But at least we know something about that staging from other sources, such as vase painting. How much deeper is the mystery around early Hebrew literature. Was a Psalm &#x201c;of Ascents,&#x201d; for instance, one repeated while climbing up to the Temple or other place of worship, or perhaps one sung as the smoke of a sacrifice &#x201c;ascended&#x201d; to heaven? And though Psalms were, it&#x2019;s clear, performed musically, what kind of music was it? And what did New Testament hymns in Greek sound like? Were they chanted or sung? In harmony, or perhaps in rounds? If I declared&#x2014;according to my strong inclination as a translator&#x2014;that the first written texts (as far as these can be reconstructed) are it, my logical and proper main interest here, how would I get closer to what that actually was&#x2014;that is, how it was experienced?<br><br>Does a translator just fill things in? In the case of ordinary ancient literature, it&#x2019;s an unashamed yes. When I translated Aristophanes&#x2019;s Lysistrata, a Classical Greek comedy that imagines all the wives in Greece going on a sexual strike until a war ends, I counted on jokes occurring at fairly regular intervals, even though modern scholarly commentators couldn&#x2019;t find all of them. Every turn in the action, every windup in dialogue, and everything unexplainable otherwise was probably a hoot to the original audience&#x2014;and where there was nothing verbally funny, stage business must have filled in, so that even bland words were funny when paired with, say, slapstick, the imitation of some public figure&#x2019;s voice, or just a strategic pause.<br><br>A Classics translator is readily forgiven if, to restore an arguably essential quality of the work (humor, in this case), she goes beyond analogy (the analogous modern joke is very common and very much accepted in secular translating, since humor dates&#x2014;more like dies&#x2014;so easily) and invents rather than leaves semantic blanks. When the protagonist Lysistrata proposes that the women withhold sex from their husbands, two wives respond with one line each. The lines are similar and contain an identical clause (usually translated as &#x201c;but let the war go on&#x201d;), yet I changed the second line into something much different:<br><br>Calonice: No, I don&#x2019;t think so. Let the war go on.<br><br>Myrrhine: Me? Not a chance in hell, so screw the war.<br><br>This kind of reconstruction allows an ancient play to keep doing the basic thing it was created to do: hold a theatrical audience&#x2019;s attention. Reconstruction can also allow an ancient poem to stay poetic, ancient law to maintain its tone of authority, and ancient rhetoric to show how it played on the passions and compunctions of crowds and juries.<br><br>A translator of the Bible can just try to get away with reconstruction. She had better, in fact, concentrate on the palpable intricacies of the languages and see what insights they yield. Those small marks in a modern, scholarly text (in Hebrew, a word can look like a cartoon character being beaten up) teach most usefully about grammar. Grammar is not just (obviously) for deciphering the text&#x2014;that is, for setting more or less acceptable words of a modern language beside the original words; but also for observing how those original words act, how they express more than their bare lexical projections into the year Now: how they put on a show.<br><br>Ancient Hebrew and Greek are inflected, not phrasal languages, a fact that makes a momentous difference in their literatures. If in English I want to express (for instance) the concept that one thing belongs to another, I usually have to string out separate words in a fixed order&#x2014;say, &#x201c;a house belonging to a man,&#x201d; &#x201c;the house of this man,&#x201d; or &#x201c;a man&#x2019;s house.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s relatively rare in English for individual words themselves to change much as their meanings change, in such a way that different meanings can branch out of a single word. An example is the principal parts of the verbs &#x201c;lay&#x201d; and &#x201c;lie&#x201d;: I lay the book down (present-tense meaning), I laid the book down (simple past), I have laid the book down (present perfect); I lie down (present), I lay down (simple past), I have lain down (present perfect). The reason it&#x2019;s so hard to keep these forms straight is that we&#x2019;re not used to expressing ourselves that way. But intricate phrasing is easy for native English speakers; one of my professors reported that his two-year-old daughter had spontaneously come out with, &#x201c;What did you bring that book I didn&#x2019;t want to be read to out of up for?&#x201d;&#x2014;with that bizarre series of prepositions and an adverb (&#x201c;up&#x201d;), no problem for the likes of us, but liable to drive a foreign student of English around the bend.<br><br>In either Hebrew or Greek, the words in that sentence would be much fewer, with concepts like &#x201c;I want&#x201d; and &#x201c;what for&#x201d; and &#x201c;to be read to&#x201d; and &#x201c;bring up&#x201d; expressed by single words, each containing substantial meaning and often through their structure entailing close relationships with other words. In an English sentence, in contrast, words tend to develop their meanings and their relationships through their order. &#x201c;What . . . for&#x201d; in &#x201c;What did you bring that book I didn&#x2019;t want to be read to out of up for?&#x201d; can&#x2019;t mean &#x201c;why&#x201d; unless the words are where they are (or maybe right beside each other at the start, but that would be awkward and not standard).<br><br>In Hebrew and Greek, word order is&#x2014;on semantic if not stylistic grounds&#x2014;much more flexible: the subject pronoun &#x201c;you&#x201d; is expressed through a finite verb&#x2019;s form, so wherever you put that verb, the subject of the little girl&#x2019;s sentence, &#x201c;you,&#x201d; won&#x2019;t be mixed up with the direct object of the verb, &#x201c;book.&#x201d; Both &#x201c;you&#x201d; and &#x201c;book&#x201d; in English become gibberish if they&#x2019;re moved at all. In Greek, that noun actually has a special form to show that it&#x2019;s a direct object, so heck, put it anywhere you want.<br><br>Hebrew has a nifty device called a construct chain for binding words together without the benefit of an &#x201c;of&#x201d; word; the words do have to stand side by side (showing that the first item belongs to the second), but beyond that their forms are usually just altered a little. &#x201c;The hand of Yahweh&#x201d; (traditionally translated as &#x201c;the hand of the Lord&#x201d;) is two words in Hebrew. But, hey, &#x201c;of a person having been set free&#x201d; can be one word in Greek; Hebrew does that kind of thing, too, just not as often.<br><br>I call such handy, highly cohesive units Legos, and I compare them to the rocks of English, which won&#x2019;t stay on top of each other unless you place them just right. In these ancient languages, you didn&#x2019;t have a great variety of words to choose from (see my next chapter, on vocabularies), as in an old-fashioned Lego set there are only a few kinds of bricks. But you sure could combine words more freely, to create structures of great size, diversity, and nuance. Custom&#x2014;especially in literary languages&#x2014;might dictate acceptable word deployment or even strings of specific words, which are called syntax and formulae, respectively; but those were powerful tools more than straitjackets. You could make a small change, fit an eight-pronged red brick in where two four-pronged blue bricks were expected, and it would be striking. Furthermore, most of these are inflected words, or bricks you can individually alter&#x2014;say, by turning a four-point green one into a two-point white one. Nothing is in the way of creating very expressive and impressive edifices.</p><h2>Art of Engraving: A Book of Instructions</h2><p>A magnificent, deluxe book with nearly 1400 photos, drawings and designs. Many are concerned with gun engraving but the techniques can be universally applied. This is an instant classic on which no effort was spared. This beautiful book gives you complete instruction in the art of engraving. The author spent seven years creating this unsurpassed resource for hand engraving. It is a supremely unique book, for not only does it sweep aside the mystery which has surrounded engraving through the centuries, but it factually, simply and in layman&#39;s terms tells you how to engrave. Unlike so many so-called &#34;instruction manuals&#34;, The Art of Engraving does not assume you know anything about engraving. You start at the beginning by learning to draw scrolls and layouts, then cut practice plates until you are sure enough of your ability to actually proceed to designing a pattern, transferring it to your piece and cutting it into the steel. Whether you want to learn to engrave now . . . think you might like to in the future . . . or simply wish to broaden your knowledge of the art to be able to better judge the work of others (as you will learn to tell the good from the bad - and know why), this is the book for you. Every gunsmith, bladesmith, metalsmith or craftsman - no matter what his other calling - has the soul of an artist.

You might take me for a nursing student or a typist, note the nervous hands, a foot tapping, bitten lip. I looked like nothing special. It&#x2019;s easy for me to imagine this girl, a strange, young and mousy version of me, carrying an anonymous leather purse or eating from a small package of peanuts, rolling each one between her gloved fingers, sucking in her cheeks, staring anxiously out the window. The sunlight in the morning illuminated the thin down on my face, which I tried to cover with pressed powder, a shade too pink for my wan complexion. I was thin, my figure was jagged, my movements pointy and hesitant, my posture stiff. The terrain of my face was heavy with soft, rumbling acne scars blurring whatever delight or madness lay beneath that cold and deadly New England exterior. If I&#x2019;d worn glasses I could have passed for smart, but I was too impatient to be truly smart. You&#x2019;d have expected me to enjoy the stillness of closed rooms, take comfort in dull silence, my gaze moving slowly across paper, walls, heavy curtains, thoughts never shifting from what my eyes identified&#x2014;book, desk, tree, person. But I deplored silence. I deplored stillness. I hated almost everything. I was very unhappy and angry all the time. I tried to control myself, and that only made me more awkward, unhappier, and angrier. I was like Joan of Arc, or Hamlet, but born into the wrong life&#x2014;the life of a nobody, a waif, invisible. There&#x2019;s no better way to say it: I was not myself back then. I was someone else. I was Eileen.</p><p>And back then&#x2014;this was fifty years ago&#x2014;I was a prude. Just look at me. I wore heavy wool skirts that fell past my knees, thick stockings. I always buttoned my jackets and blouses as high as they could go. I wasn&#x2019;t a girl who turned heads. But there was nothing really so wrong or terrible about my appearance. I was young and fine, average, I guess. But at the time I thought I was the worst&#x2014;ugly, disgusting, unfit for the world. In such a state it seemed ridiculous to call attention to myself. I rarely wore jewelry, never perfume, and I didn&#x2019;t paint my nails. For a while I did wear a ring with a little ruby in it. It had belonged to my mother.</p><p>My last days as that angry little Eileen took place in late December, in the brutal cold town where I was born and raised. The snow had fallen for the winter, a good three or four feet of it. It sat staunchly in every front yard, rolled out at the lip of every first-floor windowsill like a flood. During the day, the top layer of snow melted and the slush in the gutters loosened a bit and you remembered that life was joyful from time to time, that the sun did shine. But by afternoon, the sun had disappeared and everything froze all over again, building a glaze on the snow so thick at night it could hold the weight of a full-grown man. Each morning, I threw salt from the bucket by the front door down the narrow path from the porch to the street. Icicles hung from the rafter over the front door, and I stood there imagining them cracking and darting through my breasts, slicing through the thick gristle of my shoulder like bullets or cleaving my brain into pieces. The sidewalk had been shoveled by the next-door neighbors, a family my father distrusted because they were Lutheran and he was Catholic. But he distrusted everyone. He was fearful and crazy the way old drunks get. Those Lutheran neighbors had left a white wicker basket of cellophane-wrapped waxed apples, a box of chocolates, and a bottle of sherry by the front door for Christmas. I remember the card read, &#x201c;Bless you both.&#x201d;</p><p>Who really knew what happened inside the house while I was at work? It was a three-story colonial of brown wood and flaking red trim. I imagine my father sucking down that sherry in the spirit of Christmas, lighting an old cigar on the stove. That&#x2019;s a funny picture. Generally he drank gin. Beer, occasionally. He was a drunk, as I said. He was simple in that way. When something was the matter, he was easy to distract and soothe: I&#x2019;d just hand him a bottle and leave the room. Of course his drinking put a strain on me as a young person. It made me very tense and edgy. That happens when one lives with an alcoholic. My story in this sense is not unique. I&#x2019;ve lived with many alcoholic men over the years, and each has taught me that it is useless to worry, fruitless to ask why, suicide to try to help them. They are who they are, for better and worse. Now I live alone. Happily. Gleefully, even. I&#x2019;m too old to concern myself with other people&#x2019;s affairs. And I no longer waste my time thinking ahead into the future, worrying about things that haven&#x2019;t happened yet. But I worried all the time when I was young, not least of all about my future, and mostly with respect to my father&#x2014;how long he had left to live, what he might do, what I would find when I got home from work each evening.</p><p>Ours was not a very nice home. After my mother died, we never sorted or put her things away, never rearranged anything, and without her to clean it, the house was dirty and dusty and full of useless decorations and crowded with things, things, things everywhere. And yet it felt completely empty. It was like an abandoned home, its owners having fled one night like Jews or gypsies. We didn&#x2019;t use the den or the dining room or the upstairs bedrooms much. Everything just sat there collecting dust, a magazine splayed over the arm of the couch for years, candy dish full of dead ants. I remember it like those photos of homes in the desert ravaged by nuclear testing. I think you can imagine the details for yourself.</p><p>I slept in the attic, on a cot purchased by my father for some summer camping trip he never took a decade earlier. The attic was unfinished, a cold and dusty place I&#x2019;d retreated to when my mother had gotten sick. Sleep in my childhood bedroom, which was next to hers, had been impossible. She had wailed and cried and called my name throughout the night. The attic was quiet. Not much noise traveled up there from the lower floors of the house. My father had an armchair that he&#x2019;d dragged from the den into the kitchen. He slept there. It was the kind of chair that shuttled backward at the pull of a lever, a charming novelty when he&#x2019;d bought it. But the lever no longer worked. The thing had rusted into permanent repose. Everything in the house was like that chair&#x2014;grimy, ruined, and frozen.</p><p>I remember it pleased me that the sun set so early that winter. Under the cover of darkness, I was somewhat comforted. My father, however, was scared of the dark. That may sound like an endearing peculiarity, but it was not. At night he would light the stove and the oven and drink and watch the blue flames whir under the weak overhead light. He was always cold, he said. And yet he barely dressed. This one evening&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll begin my story there&#x2014;I found him sitting barefoot on the stairs, drinking the sherry, the butt of a cigar between his fingers. &#x201c;Poor Eileen,&#x201d; he said sarcastically when I walked through the door. He was very contemptuous of me, found me pathetic and unattractive and had no qualms about saying so. If my daydreams from back then came true, one day I&#x2019;d have found him splayed out at the bottom of the stairs, neck broken but still breathing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say with the most bored affect I could muster, peering over his dying body. So I loathed him, yes, but I was very dutiful. It was just the two of us in the house&#x2014;Dad and me. I do have a sister, still alive as far as I know, but we haven&#x2019;t spoken in over fifty years.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Dad,&#x201d; I said, passing him on the stairs.</p><p>He was not a very large man, but he had broad shoulders and long legs, a sort of regal look about him. His thinning gray hair stood up high and bowed over the crown of his head. His face appeared to be decades older than he really was, and bore in it a wide-eyed skepticism and a look of perpetual disapproval. In retrospect he was much like the boys in the prison where I worked&#x2014;sensitive and angry. His hands shook all the time no matter how much he drank. He was always rubbing at his chin, which was red and drawn and wrinkled. He&#x2019;d tug at it the way you&#x2019;d rub the head of a young boy and call him a little rascal. His one regret in life, he said, was that he&#x2019;d never been able to grow a real beard, as though he could have willed it, but he had failed to. He was like that&#x2014;regretful and arrogant and illogical at once. I don&#x2019;t think he ever really loved his children. The wedding band he continued to wear years after her death suggested that he&#x2019;d loved our mother to some degree at least. But I suspect he was incapable of love, real love. He was a cruel character. Imagining his parents beating him as a child is the only path to forgiveness that I have found so far. It isn&#x2019;t perfect, but it does the trick.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t a story of how awful my father was, let me be clear. Bemoaning his cruelty is not the point of this at all. But I do remember that day on the stairs, how he winced when he turned to look up at me, as though the sight of me made him ill. I stood on the landing, looking down.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going out again,&#x201d; he croaked, &#x201c;to Lardner&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Lardner&#x2019;s was the liquor store across town. He let the empty sherry bottle slip from his fingers and roll down the staircase, step by step.</p><p>I&#x2019;m very reasonable now, peaceful even, but back then I was easily enraged. My father&#x2019;s demands that I do his bidding like a maid, a servant, were constant. But I was not the kind of girl to say no to anyone.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>My father grunted and puffed on the short butt of his cigar.</p><p>When I was disturbed, I took some comfort in attending to my appearance. I was obsessed with the way I looked, in fact. My eyes are small and green, and you wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;especially back then&#x2014;have seen much kindness in them. I am not one of those women who try to make people happy all the time. I&#x2019;m not that strategic. If you&#x2019;d seen me back then with a barrette in my hair, my mousy gray wool coat, you&#x2019;d have expected me to be just a minor character in this saga&#x2014;conscientious, even-tempered, dull, irrelevant. I looked like a shy and gentle soul from afar, and sometimes I wished I was one. But I cursed and blushed and broke out in sweats quite often, and that day I slammed the bathroom door shut by kicking it with the full sole of my shoe, nearly busting the hinges. I looked so boring, lifeless, immune and unaffected, but in truth I was always furious, seething, my thoughts racing, my mind like a killer&#x2019;s. It was easy to hide behind the dull face I wore, moping around. I really thought I had everybody fooled. And I didn&#x2019;t really read books about flowers or home economics. I liked books about awful things&#x2014;murder, illness, death. I remember selecting one of the thickest books from the public library, a chronicle of ancient Egyptian medicine, to study the gruesome practice of pulling the brains of the dead out through the nose like skeins of yarn. I liked to think of my brain like that, tangled up in my skull. The idea that my brains could be untangled, straightened out, and thus refashioned into a state of peace and sanity was a comforting fantasy. I often felt there was something wired weird in my brain, a problem so complicated only a lobotomy could solve it&#x2014;I&#x2019;d need a whole new mind or a whole new life. I could be very dramatic in my self-assessments. Besides books, I enjoyed my issues of <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, which I got delivered to me in the mail. That was a real luxury and made me feel very special. Articles describing the naive beliefs of the primitives fascinated me. Their blood rites, the human sacrifices, all that needless suffering. I was dark, you might say. Moony. But I don&#x2019;t think I was really so hardhearted by nature. Had I been born into a different family, I might have grown up to act and feel perfectly normal.</p><p>Truth be told, I was a glutton for punishment. I didn&#x2019;t really mind getting bossed around by my father. I&#x2019;d get angry, and I loathed him, yes, but my fury gave my life a kind of purpose, and running his errands killed time. That is what I imagined life to be&#x2014;one long sentence of waiting out the clock.</p><p>I tried to look miserable and exhausted when I came out from the bathroom that evening. My father groaned impatiently. I sighed and plucked the cash he held out. I buttoned my coat back up. I was relieved to have somewhere to go, a way to pass the evening hours other than to pace the attic or watch my father drink. There was nothing I loved more than leaving the house.</p><p>If I had slammed the front door hard on my way out, as I was tempted to, one of those icicles overhead would have surely cracked off. I imagined one plummeting through the hollow of my collarbone and stabbing me straight through the heart. Or, had I tilted my head back, perhaps it would have soared down my throat, scraping the vacuous center of my body&#x2014;I liked to picture these things&#x2014;and followed through to my guts, finally parting my nether regions like a glass dagger. That was how I imagined my anatomy back then, brain like tangled yarn, body like an empty vessel, private parts like some strange foreign country. But I was careful shutting the door, of course. I didn&#x2019;t really want to die.</p><p>Since my father had become unfit to drive it, I drove his old Dodge. I loved that car. It was a four-door Coronet, matte green, full of scrapes and dents. The floorboards had rusted through from years of salt and ice. I kept in the glove box of the Dodge a dead field mouse I&#x2019;d found one day on the porch frozen in a tight ball. I&#x2019;d picked it up by its tail and swirled it through the air for a moment, then slung it in the glove box with a broken flashlight, a map of New England freeways, a few green nickels. Every now and then that winter, I&#x2019;d peek at the mouse, check on its invisible decomposition in the freezing cold. I think it made me feel powerful somehow. A little totem. A good luck charm.</p><p>Outside I tested the temperature with the tip of my tongue, sticking it out into the biting wind until it hurt. That night it must have been down close to single digits. It hurt just to breathe. But I preferred cold weather over hot. Summers I was restless and cranky. I&#x2019;d break out in rashes, have to lie in cold baths. I&#x2019;d sit at my desk in the prison whipping a paper fan furiously at my face. I did not like to sweat in front of other people. Such proof of carnality I found lewd, disgusting. Similarly, I did not like to dance or do sports. I did not listen to the Beatles or watch Ed Sullivan on TV. I wasn&#x2019;t interested in fun or popularity back then. I preferred to read about ancient times, distant lands. Knowledge of anything current or faddish made me feel I was just a victim of isolation. If I avoided all that on purpose, I could believe I was in control.</p><p>One thing about that Dodge was that it made me sick to drive it. I knew there was something wrong with the exhaust, but at the time I couldn&#x2019;t think of dealing with such a problem. Part of me liked having to roll down the windows, even in the cold. I thought that I was very brave. But really I was scared that if I made a fuss over the car, it would be taken away from me. That car was the one thing in my life that ga...</p></p><h2>Hyperwest: American Residential Architecture on the Edge</h2><p>The American West has long stood for adventure and opportunity, wide open spaces, the new frontier.

She lives in England with her husband, three whippets, and over five hundred rosebushes. </p>Grade 7-12-The mythical world of Damar, featured in The Hero and the Crown (1984) and The Blue Sword (1982, both Greenwillow), is the setting for four of the five stories in this uneven collection. Damar's medieval atmosphere serves as a perfect backdrop for tales of magic and mysterious events. However, for those who haven't read the novels, there is little clarification of details that crop up from them. The sorcerer Luthe, an integral character in both Hero and Sword, appears in two of these stories, but his significance is not explained. The strength of plot development varies; it is at its best in "Touk's House." Less convincing is "The Stagman," in which the passive princess Ruen, rescued by the Stagman from her evil uncle who usurped her kingdom, now joins the beast/man, leaving her husband after 20 years of apparently happy marriage. The collection's anomaly, though delightful, is the title story. Set in the present day, it is the tale of a teenager who prevents the destruction of her small town by a superhighway-with the help of a mysterious box she finds in the attic. It is misplaced among the Damarian stories, but reveals this talented author's ability to utilize various settings, and whets readers' appetites for more modern-day fantasy from her. All in all, a mixed bag, but one that will be enjoyed by fans of McKinley's earlier books.<br><i>Mary Jo Drungil, Niles Public Library District, IL</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Martial Power: A 4th Edition D&amp;D Supplement (D&amp;D Rules Expansion)</h2><p>New options for fighters, rangers, rogues, and warlords.<br><br>This tome focuses on the martial heroes: characters who rely on their combat talents and keen wits for survival. <br><br>This book provides new archetypal builds for the fighter, ranger, rogue, and warlord classes, including new character powers, feats, paragon paths, and epic destinies.<br><br>Martial Power is the first of a line of player-friendly supplements offering hundreds of new options for <b>D&amp;D</b> characters.</p><p></p><h2>Lethal Elegance: The Art of Samurai Sword Fittings</h2><p>As the "soul of the samurai," the sword is famously both the symbol and instrument of Japanese military prowess. Less known, at least in the west, is its role as a fashion accessory or status symbol. More than the weapon itself, it was the sword's metal fittings--from the hand guard to the small decorative plates on the hilt--that reflected the complexities of samurai life. Some fittings were meant to convey the honor and self-control expected of a samurai, while other, more flamboyant fittings reflected the samurai's leisure-time persona as "man about town." Later, when the wearing of swords spread beyond the samurai class, both the decorative function of the fittings and the variety of their designs increased, leading to some of the most accomplished metalwork ever created. Now in paperback for the first time, <i>Lethal Elegance</i> presents 150 of these remarkable sword fittings, and is one of the few books to focus on their styles and techniques. It discusses the visual effects achieved with different alloys, the evolution of fittings following changes in warfare, symbolism and standards for connoisseurship. Though these objects were created for violent ends, their variety and beauty also reveal them as wonders of self-expression.</p><p></p><h2>Rinkitink in OZ</h2><p><p>Meet Rinkitink--a kindhearted king who's as fat and jolly as old Saint Nick himself!

The son of a French naval officer and a Creole woman, Audubon was born in Haiti in 1785, educated in France and moved to his family's estate near Philadelphia in 1803. It was there that his love of birds and his desire to draw them became the driving force and consuming passion of his life. Audubon devoted his life to the single pursuit of accurately yet artistically capturing the intricate details and individual splendor of the birds of North America. The enduring popularity and relevance of his work attests to his success both as a scientist and an artist. Today, Audubon's name is synonymous with wildlife preservation, and he is recognized as one of the greatest artists of his time. The 150 prints in this book are known as being among the very best examples of Audubon artistry. From the Carolina Parrot, now sadly extinct, to the rare Whooping Crane and the more common blue birds and woodpeckers, Audubon's portrayals are among the finest examples of wildlife art in existence. This exquisite collection of plates represents Audubon's genius at its very height. Audubon's Masterpieces is without a doubt one of the most magnificent collections of bird prints every published.</p></p><p>John James Audubon (April 26, 1785 ? January 27, 1851) was a French American ornithologist, naturalist, and painter. He was notable for his expansive studies to document all types of American birds and for his detailed illustrations that depicted the birds in their natural habitats. His major work, a color-plate book entitled The Birds of America (1827?1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. Audubon identified 25 new species.</p><h2>Nervous Conditions: A Novel</h2><p>Used Softcover Edition published by Seal Press, N.Y, 1989, 204 pages in Very Good Condition.

She studied medicine and psychology before turning to writing full-time and becoming the first Black woman in Zimbabwe to publish a novel in English. Nervous Conditions was the recipient of the 1989 Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize for Fiction, the book has become a modern classic. Nervous Conditions was also chosen as one of the &#x2018;Top Ten Books of Africa&#x2019;s 100 Best Books of the 20th Century&#x2019; by a Pan African Initiative in 2002. Dangarembga&#x2019;s sequel to Nervous Conditions entitled The Book of Not was published in 2006 by Ayebia. In addition, she has written a play entitled She No Longer Weeps. Having studied at the German Film and Television Academy, Dangarembga now also works as a scriptwriter, consultant and film director. She is the founder of International Images Film Festival for Women (IIFF). She is currently working on the third novel in the trilogy and lives in Zimbabwe."I was not sorry when my brother died." So begins Tambu, narrator of <b>Nervous Conditions</b>, as she looks back on her childhood. Tambu grew up on her family's impoverished farm within a traditional native society; her determination to receive an education, however, brings her into contact with British colonialism in the form of mission schools. As an African woman, Tambu comes to understand that oppression has many forms; it is never simple and solutions are hard to come by. The patriarchal traditions of her own culture oppress women, while British colonial education takes native children from their parents, literally and figuratively. Tambu grows maize to earn her school fees because there is only enough family money for her brother, only to have her brother steal her produce and give it to friends. She tells of her cousin Nyasha, raised in England and brought back to Zimbabwe; unable to live in either culture, she self-destructively turns her struggle inward. Tambu talks of how she herself has changed. Despite the pain and oppression that she has witnessed, Tambu loves her country. Bitterly, with barely repressed irony, she points out wrongs, and then lovingly describes a pathway, a pool, the face of a woman. A strong, intelligent, loving girl/woman, Tambu is a character to stay with and care about, even - perhaps especially - as the conditions she describes enrage us. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Hell&#39;s Foundations Quiver: A Novel in the Safehold Series (Safehold, 8)</h2><p><p><i>Hell's Foundations Quiver:</i> David Weber's <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling Safehold series begun with <i>Off Armageddon Reef</i>, <i>By Schism Rent Asunder</i>, <i>By Heresies Distressed, A Mighty Fortress </i>and <i>Like a Mighty Army</i>.</p><p>TURNING OF THE TIDE</p><p>Centuries ago, the human race fought its first great war against an alien race-and lost.

J. Simpson case,</em> which in turn had <em>closed the Menendez case,</em> the Andrew mystery would ultimately be <em>solved by the death of Princess Di..."</em> -- from <em>Three Month Fever</em></blockquote><p>In <em>Three Month Fever,</em> his first book-length work of nonfiction, Gary Indiana presents the 1997 killing spree of Andrew Cunanan as a peculiarly contemporary artifact, an alloy in which reality and myth have been inseparably combined. The case generated an astonishing sequence of news reports in which the suspect became a "monster," "serial killer," "high-priced homosexual prostitute," "pervert," "master of disguise," "chameleon," and so forth. In reality, this figure of dread bore little resemblance to the scary sociopath of legend. </p><p> In following Cunanan's "trail of death," Indiana presents a riveting, fully realized portrait of a very bright, even brilliant young man whom people liked. He had charisma, great looks, and money that he spent very freely on others. He was a sympathetic listener with a phenomenal memory for names, faces, and virtually anything he read or saw. But he didn't fit in anywhere, and he couldn't solve the problem of how to live. </p><p> He was trying to do better, to come from a better place, to have a better background. He made up stories about himself that made him feel more like other people or made him seem more interesting than he thought he was. </p><p> He wanted to be loved for himself. The two people he thought might love him for himself didn't, and he ended up killing them. This was probably the last thing he wanted to do. </p><p> Andrew was compulsively social, and as long as he could establish some intercourse with the outside world he could function, even if he had to conceal the ugly secrets he was accumulating. He could hang out in gay bars in Chicago while on the run, come to New York and live in a bathhouse, go to movies, pick people up. Even after the killing in New Jersey, his crimes were below the threshold of most people's awareness. </p><p> But in Miami he found himself trapped, the very places where he expected to "blend in" were informed about who he was and what he looked like. It was isolation he could not deal with--and that led to his total disintegration and the death of Gianni Versace. </p><p> <em>Three Month Fever</em> is a tour de force in which Indiana reveals how Andrew Cunanan fell apart over time and what he might have sounded like in his own mind. Rarely has a writer immersed himself in the mind of a killer with such startling effect. Gary Indiana has created a new form of true crime that is as insightful as it is riveting. </p></p><p><p>Gary Indiana's novels include <em>Resentment: A Comedy, Rent Boy, Gone Tomorrow,</em> and <em>Horse Crazy.</em> He has published two collections of short fiction and a collection of essays, <em>Let It Bleed.</em> His plays include the award-winning Roy Cohn/Jack Smith, <em>The Roman Polanski Story,</em> and <em>Phantoms of Louisiana.</em> His nonfiction work has appeared in the <em>Village Voice, Artforum, Details, Newsweek,</em> the <em>Los Angeles Times,</em> and numerous other publications.

You can, after all, drive from downtown straight through the airport into Point Loma without crossing such epic wastes as separate most cities from most airports. Aside from the brevity of this ride, Andrew had already talked himself silly in the days just previous, to Kenneth Higgins and Robin Thompson and Erik Greenman and various others, some of whom attended Andrew's so-called going-away dinner, about his imminent relocation to San Francisco, and what he termed <i>this little side trip to Minneapolis</i>, claiming among other things to have <i>excellent business prospects in San Francisco,</i> a new apartment, a new roommate, what amounted to <i>a whole new life</i> waiting for him in the city on the bay. These prospects were so auspicious that Andrew had declared his intention to <i>buy a whole new wardrobe,</i> consequently, in the days just prior to this little side trip to Minneapolis, Andrew gave away Missoni sweaters and Dolce &amp; Gabbana suits and Ferragamo shoes, Helmut Lang blazers and Prada jackets, designer clothing items from shops on Rodeo Drive, shops in Milan, shops in San Francisco, pricey garments acquired in the course of his incessant travels, some barely worn, gave them away in an access of insensible largesse, much to the distress of Erik Greenman, Andrew's roommate, who later complained that Andrew gave many items to near strangers that happened to fit Erik Greenman perfectly.</p><p>One of the themes Andrew had developed since his recent trips to Los Angeles and San Francisco was his <i>overwhelming love</i> for David Madson, a neophyte architect in Minneapolis whom few of Andrew's San Diego friends had ever met. According to Andrew, his affair with David Madson had started on a high note the previous summer but faltered and ultimately fizzled because of the long-distance nature of the relationship, and it was only now, when the spark had almost sputtered out entirely, that Andrew realized how much David meant to him. David was, he told Kenneth, <i>the only person in the world he had ever really loved.</i> He had managed to spend the week before Easter or part of the week before Easter in a hotel room with David Madson in Los Angeles, had wined David and dined David and even clothed David in an Armani suit and an Andrew Mark jacket courtesy of Andrew's platinum card, not just David but two of David's friends as well, a so-called model named Karen Lapinski and her fianc�, Evan Wallitt, a yuppie couple from San Francisco, <i>at the Chateau Marmont,</i> Andrew emphasized, which might not have been the priciest place in Los Angeles but was certainly one of the classiest, especially now that Eric Goode had done it over, yet none of this sumptuary excess had worked the desired magic.</p><p>Andrew said that his sister was an anesthesiologist who worked in Minneapolis and he said he wanted to <i>try again</i> with David Madson. He told some people that he had <i>unfinished business</i> with Jeffrey Trail, a friend of his who was, unlike David Madson, well-remembered in San Diego, an ex-navy heartthrob Andrew had stuck to like glue for years and years, who had, much to Andrew's dismay, moved to Minneapolis a few months earlier. But Andrew always said a lot of things. Sometimes he said he had served eleven months in Israeli intelligence and sometimes he claimed his family owned the Ace Parking concessions downtown. People liked Andrew for his brassy joie de vivre and his quick tongue and rolled their eyes at his stories when he wasn't looking. Andrew was not a flaming queen, but he did have that hyperbolic theatricality, everything calculated to amuse or impress. He usually gave his name as <i>DeSilva,</i> which didn't really sound Jewish, but Erik, who lived with him and had to know, said his real name was <i>Cunanan,</i> which really didn't either.</p><p>Andrew left San Diego carrying a single black nylon duffel bag, and as usual he was, in the parlance of the California Southland, "upbeat."</p><b>Two<p></p></b><i></i><p><i>I'm of two minds about the future,</i> he thought, having developed considerable uncertainty about his precise location on the map of his own existence. His sister Regina lived in San Francisco, not Minneapolis. They'd talked about Andrew moving in with her and Andrew, with part of his mind, was en route to San Francisco, but another part seemed to be traveling to Minneapolis, not for a little side trip, but to <i>set up shop</i>, as he thought of it, a thought having some reverberation in his childhood, when Andrew and a friend played a game called Store, in which they operated a miraculous store where they could <i>sell anything</i> a customer asked for, since at that innocent age he believed that anything demanded could be magically supplied. The smudgy landscapes of National City shimmered in his mind, drought-stunted jacaranda trees, a parched riverbed at the bottom of a hollow, ribbons of tarmac with minimalls and fast-food huts, loan offices and auto repair shops, the occasional fenced enclave of sedentary mobile homes. Trailer parks in National City usually resembled municipal dumps, littered with broken lawn furniture, tires, cinder blocks, and discarded propane canisters. The Catholic churches looked like Howard Johnson's. Everything in National City teetered between the organic ugliness of poverty and the antiseptic ugliness of Target stores and McDonald's franchises.</p><p>At the so-called farewell dinner he kept his ambivalence and his recent uncustomary depression in check, though the fact that the guests barely knew one another reminded him that his social existence here had always been disjointed, a matter of part-time residence in many different worlds, and that his friendships misfitted some bold image he held of his place in the....</p></p><h2>Tales of the City (Harper Colophon Books)</h2><p>The acclaimed best-seller by the author of <i>Significant Other, Babycakes, </i>and <i>Sure of You </i>follows the experiences of Anna Madrigal, doyenne of 28 Barbary Lane.

There, the Inuit, the Arctic&#x2019;s first explorers, have survived and thrived in the harshest of climates. For the Inuit, an ice-age, ice-adapted people who first traveled from Siberia across the polar North six thousand years ago, weather is consciousness. In a world composed of ice and darkness, water and light, where skins of dog, seal, bear, even hare and eider duck, are sewn into clothes, tents, and sleeping bags as protection, where transport is by dogsled and kayak, the only rein for the uncontrollable force of weather is an unbending self-discipline. The blend of physical endurance and psychological perseverance required for daily existence first drew Ehrlich to this terrain. <br><br>Her guide, her inspiration, her companion in spirit was the great Danish-Inuit explorer and ethnographer Knud Rasmussen. Between 1902 and his death in 1933 he launched seven expeditions: to record the unknown history and customs of the nomadic Eskimos; to chronicle the skills, beliefs,and crafts that made life in this climate possible and a matter of grace. For Rasmussen, &#x201c;all true wisdom is only to be found far from the dwellings of man, in great solitudes.&#x201d; As she followed his trail, Ehrlich was to find the things that can open the mind to what is hidden from others. <b>This Cold Heaven</b> is at once a distillation of her many journeys, a path into a world divided into darkness and light and, finally, an attempt to capture the clarity that blinds us with surprise.</p><p>From the acclaimed chronicler of open spaces, Gretel Ehrlich, comes a stunning and lyrical evocation of a practically unknown place and people. Beginning in 1993, Ehrlich traveled to Greenland, the northernmost country in the world, in every season--the four months of perpetual dark (in which the average temperature is 25 degrees below zero), the four months of constant daylight, and the twilight seasons in between--traveling up the west coast, often by dogsled, and befriending the resilient and generous Inuits along the way. Greenland, unlike its name, is 95 percent ice--a landscape of deep rock-walled fjords, glaciers, narwhal whales swimming among icebergs the size of football fields, walruses busting through oceans of shifting ice. In the far north, the polar Inuit--the "real heroes"--still dress in bear and seal skins, and hunt walrus, polar bears, and whales with harpoons. The only constant is weather and the perilous movements of ice, the only transport is dogsled, and the closest village may be a month and a half-long dogsled journey away. The people share an austere and harsh life, lightened with humor and the fantastic stories of Sila, the god of weather, Nerrivik, the goddess of waters, of humans transforming themselves into animals, and interspecies marriages. Interwoven with Ehrlich's journey is the even more remarkable story of Knud Rasmussen, the founder of Eskimology, an Inuit-Danish explorer and ethnographer who took some of the most hazardous and brilliant expeditions ever, including a three and a half-year, 20,000-mile adventure by dogsled across the polar north to Alaska. Like Rasmussen, Ehrlich learns that the landscape of Greenland is "less a description of desolation than an ode to the beauty of impermanence." Alternately mind-expanding, gripping, and dreamlike, <i>This Cold Heaven</i> is a revelation. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>"Enigmatic and exuberant, Gretel Erhlich captures, if any seer and poet can, the hunt for beauty, the rapture of a foreboding landscape where man, polar bear, shaman, seal, dog, walrus, and narwhale entwine inseparably in a fragile, yet enduring embrace of timelessness on a planet spinning between ice-filled water and infinite space. Without a doubt, one of the finest books ever written about the polar regions."<br>--Wade Davis, Explorer in Residence at the National Geographic Society <br><br>"This strange and lovely book-- by turns travelogue, history, biography, memoir, and lyrical celebration-- beautifully captures the feel of the high Arctic and the lives of those who have lived and explored there. Reaching across the decades, Ehrlich has found in Rasmussen a kindred soul." <br>-Andrea Barrett, author of <i>Ship Fever </i>and <i>The Voyage of the Narwhal<br></i><br>"Combining timidity, foolhardiness, tenacity, erudition and poetry, Gretel Ehrlich's is a superb voice for the miracle of Greenland. No one who reads this wonderful book will ever forget these singular people or the austerities of the land they inhabit." <br>-Thomas McGuane, author of <i>The Longest Silence </i><br><br>"I'd always thought of Greenland as a hunk of mostly inhabited ice somewhere vaguely north. Not anymore. Gretel Ehrlich brings the people, the place, the ice itself alive in ways as vivid and startling as if she'd gone to another planet. In that cold landscape she finds real heat, the slush and juice of life fully lived amid terrifying extremes. She follows her nose for adventure to an edge most of us can barely imagine; read <i>This Cold Heaven</i> and go with her." <br>-Joe Kane, author of <i>Crossing the Amazon </i></p><h2>Maps and Globes</h2><p>A brief history of mapmaking, a simple explanation of how to read maps and globes, and an introduction to the many different kinds of maps there are.</p><p><p>Maps and globes can take you anywhere -- to the top of the tallest mountain on earth or the bottom of the deepest ocean.

THE LOVELY BONES is such a book -- a #1 bestseller celebrated at once for its artistry, for its luminous clarity of emotion, and for its astonishing power to lay claim to the hearts of millions of readers around the world.<i></i><i></i><i><br></i><i>"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973."</i><i></i><br>So begins the story of Susie Salmon, who is adjusting to her new home in heaven, a place that is not at all what she expected, even as she is watching life on earth continue without her -- her friends trading rumors about her disappearance, her killer trying to cover his tracks, her grief-stricken family unraveling. Out of unspeakable tragedy and loss, THE LOVELY BONES succeeds, miraculously, in building a tale filled with hope, humor, suspense, even joy.<br><br></p><p>On her way home from school on a snowy December day in 1973, 14-year-old Susie Salmon ("like the fish") is lured into a makeshift underground den in a cornfield and brutally raped and murdered, the latest victim of a serial killer--the man she knew as her neighbor, Mr. Harvey. <p> Alice Sebold's haunting and heartbreaking debut novel, <i>The Lovely Bones</i>, unfolds from heaven, where "life is a perpetual yesterday" and where Susie narrates and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends, as well as her brazen killer and the sad detective working on her case. As Sebold fashions it, everyone has his or her own version of heaven. Susie's resembles the athletic fields and landscape of a suburban high school: a heaven of her "simplest dreams," where "there were no teachers.... We never had to go inside except for art class.... The boys did not pinch our backsides or tell us we smelled; our textbooks were <i>Seventeen</i> and <i>Glamour</i> and <i>Vogue</i>." </p><p> <i>The Lovely Bones</i> works as an odd yet affecting coming-of-age story. Susie struggles to accept her death while still clinging to the lost world of the living, following her family's dramas over the years like an episode of <i>My So-Called Afterlife</i>. Her family disintegrates in their grief: her father becomes determined to find her killer, her mother withdraws, her little brother Buckley attempts to make sense of the new hole in his family, and her younger sister Lindsey moves through the milestone events of her teenage and young adult years with Susie riding spiritual shotgun. Random acts and missed opportunities run throughout the book--Susie recalls her sole kiss with a boy on Earth as "like an accident--a beautiful gasoline rainbow." Though sentimental at times, <i>The Lovely Bones</i> is a moving exploration of loss and mourning that ultimately puts its faith in the living and that is made even more powerful by a cast of convincing characters. Sebold orchestrates a big finish, and though things tend to wrap up a little <i>too</i> well for everyone in the end, one can only imagine (or hope) that heaven is indeed a place filled with such happy endings. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i> <br><br> </p><p> <strong>Look Inside the Motion Picture <i>The Lovely Bones</i> (Paramount, 2010)</strong><br>(Click on each image below to see a larger view) <br><br> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br>Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon </td> <td> <br>Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon </td> </tr></tbody> </table> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br>Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon </td> <td> <br>Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon and Director Peter Jackson </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br><br>Alice Sebold is the author of three #1 bestselling books, the novels <i>The Lovely Bones</i> and <i>The Almost Moon</i> and the memoir <i>Lucky.</i> She lives in California with her husband, the novelist Glen David Gold.</p><h2>Light of the World: The Pope, The Church and the Signs Of The Times</h2><p>Never has a Pope, in a book-length interview, dealt so directly with such wide-ranging and controversial issues as Pope Benedict XVI does in Light of the World. Taken from a recent week-long series of interviews with veteran journalist Peter Seewald, this book tackles head-on some of the greatest issues facing the world of our time. Twice before these two men held wide-ranging discussions, which became the best-selling books Salt of the Earth and God and the World. Then, Seewald&#39;s discussion partner was Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican&#39;s chief doctrinal office. Now, Joseph Ratzinger is Pope Benedict XVI, the spiritual leader of the world&#39;s over one billion Catholics. Though Seewald now interviews the Pope himself, the journalist pulls no punches, posing some of the thorniest questions any Pope has had to address. Believers and unbelievers will be fascinated to hear Benedict&#39;s thoughtful, straightforward and thought-provoking replies. This is no stern preachment or ponderous theological tract, but a lively, fast-paced, challenging, even entertaining exchange.</p><p><p><b>Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI </b>(Joseph Ratzinger) is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age.

This is her first book for children.<br><br>Amy Cordova has illustrated many children s books. She lives in Cleveland, New Mexico.Inspired by the life of renowned Oaxacan woodcarver Manuel Jimenez, newcomer Cohn and Cordova (My Land Sings) tell of Mateo, a young woodcarver who bravely breaks with a generations-old artistic tradition. The subsistence farmers of the boy's village are known for their juguetes, tiny carvings of wooden animals so small they could fit in the palm of a hand, carved by men and boys, and painted in fiesta-bright colors by women and girls. But Mateo dreams of carving life-size animals, with surfaces that tingle with vibrant, improbable colors and surreal patterns. I see animals so big and bright that I will need to carve them with a machete! he tells his disapproving father. When Mateo ultimately produces a glorious wooden menagerie including a quetzal with majestic feathers he wins over not only Papa, but the entire village, and a new way of carving is born. Cohn captures the boy's pursuit with straightforward eloquence, whether describing a child's heady experience of a fiesta or articulating the imaginative forces that set apart and drive a true artist. Cordova chronicles Mateo's artistic development in radiant, double-spread tableaux, setting off the text with festive decorative borders. She borrows the highly stylized characterizations and flattened perspectives typical of Mexican folk art, but she animates the compositions with big, bold shapes and electric, saturated colors. A fitting tribute to the energy and power of an artist's distinctive vision.

Around the social turmoils of the war, what becomes of OHara and Rhett Butler, an outcast whom she marries for money?</p><p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia, in November 1900, Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell belonged to a wealthy and a politically prominent family. Encouraged by her husband, she began writing the novel that would become Gone with the Wind. Nine complete drafts of the thousand-page work, she set this epic romance against the dramatic backdrop of the Civil War. Published in 1936, ten years after she began writing it, Gone with the Wind was a smash success. It became, and still remains, one of the classic masterpieces of all time. Receiving a Pulitzer Prize in 1937, a film version of the novel was planned in the late 1930s.</p><h2>The Romance of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;Illustrated with sixteen full-color plates and sixteen black and white illustrations by Arthur Rackham. This vigorous, eloquent epic tale of valor is noted for having been written in the best English prose of the Fifteenth Century. The accompanying illustrations are, of course, a perfect example of the best illustrations of any century. The characters will be familiar: Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, for this is the definitive account of the Arthurian legends, and Pollard&#39;s is the definitive abridgement....&#34;</p><p>Scholars have determined that there were at least six Thomas Malorys alive in the 1400s when Le Morte d'Arthur was written. Considerable evidence points to the likeliest author as one Sir Thomas Malory or Maleore of Newbold Revell in Warwickshire, who was born in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. A member of the gentry, he became a soldier in the service of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, with whom he fought in the siege of Calais in 1436. In records of the period he is accused of various crimes--including armed robbery, attempted murder, and rape--and he is said to have executed several dramatic escapes from prison. <br>Several things about Malory seem indisputable. As in Arthur's time when post-Roman Britain was in a state of fierce tribal war, he lived in an age of great unrest. Europe was still recovering from the Black Plague and a century of war. In England, two powerful families fought for the throne. Although he may have been a scoundrel, Malory was also, it seems clear, a man of ideals who believed in courage and loyalty, and who mourned the passing of chivalry. Incarcerated for long periods, he had many hours to fill his imagination with French romances and tales of chivalry, volumes of which were readily at hand. It is thought that Le Morte d'Arthur was written during his imprisonment. <br>Malory referred to himself as a 'knight-prisoner.' With a military man's passion for the details of conquest, a prisoner's sense of injustice, and a penitent's desire for redemption, he dedicated himself wholeheartedly to this retelling of the Arthurian legends. Sir Thomas Malory died, it is presumed, around 1471.</p><h2>Here, There, Elsewhere: Stories from the Road</h2><p><strong>From the acclaimed author of <i>Blue Highways</i>, <i>PrairyErth</i>, and <i>Roads to Quoz</i>, a dazzling collection of travel tales from the road.</strong><br><br>HERE, THERE, ELSEWHERE draws together for the first time William Least Heat-Moon's greatest short-form travel writing.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p><h2>remembered rapture: the writer at work</h2><p>Drawing on her experiences as a professor of English and the author of sixteen highly acclaimed books, critic bell hooks presents an insightful collection of essays on the process and politics of writing. Centrally, many of the essays raise provocative questions about the feminist movement and women's writing--the kinds of voices women have established in the wake of the demand for more writing by women, the politics of confession and the type of standards being set for women writers by critics. Several essays explore hooks's personal relationship to publishing, explaining the impact success has had on her work as she highlights her movement from writing in relative isolation to writing in New York City amidst the publishing industry, in a world full of writers. Other essays focus on the dearth of nonfiction writing by Black women, contrasting that with the rise in their published fiction. More general essays focus on writing as healing, raising issues about the function of writing; the extent to which readers inspire writers; and how race, ger, and class can determine one's relationship to words. Remembered Rapture offers a fresh and lively discussion of living with words.<br></p><p>African American women writers, being both black and female, face challenges that the rest of us might never have even considered. While this essay collection is ultimately a celebration of the writing life and of the writers author bell hooks (who signs her name with lower-case letters) cites as inspirational, it also illuminates the issues she and other black women writers have to contend with in their careers. Hooks has been criticized for, among other things, being incredibly prolific (she has been called "the Joyce Carol Oates of black feminist writing") and for her scope: "Black writers," says hooks, "always have difficulty gaining recognition for a body of work if anything we do is eclectic." Though hooks does take her critics to task, she is more concerned with confronting a system that seems determined to work against black women--and other minority--writers. She is critical of publishers for throwing the largest advances and promotional efforts at white male authors. She complains that "when writers from marginalized groups do work that is truly marvelous," the literary establishment is likely to see that work as a "rare exception." And she even rails against black women writers themselves, saying that "Nothing diminishes our efforts to gain a greater hearing for nonfiction by black women more than the severe dismissals of this work by black women."<p> Autobiography is one form of writing that hooks feels is particularly difficult for black women writers, most of whom come from families that never previously "had to think about whether a relative would write something about their lives." In fact, she says, autobiographical writing is troublesome for writers who do not "come from class backgrounds where there are rituals of public confession like psychoanalysis." As a child, says hooks, "talking openly outside the family about any aspect of family life was considered a form of treason." Now, though her family is proud of her and pleased that she has not forsaken her origins, she says, "writing about my life has created an emotional distance between me and my parents. An intimacy we once shared is gone." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Born and raised in the rural South, bell hooks learned early the power of the written word and the importance of speaking her mind. This passion for words is the heartbeat of this contemplative collection of essays. Remembered Rapture celebrates literacy, the joys of reading and writing, and the lasting power of the book. These essays once again reveal bell hooks&#39;s wide-ranging intellectual scope; if W. E. B. DuBois elegantly dissected the double consciousness of African-Americans, bell hooks, with similar insight and vision, untangles the complex personae of women writers, especially those whose work goes against the grain.</p><h2>1225 Christmas Tree Lane (Cedar Cove, 12)</h2><p><br><br>The people of Cedar Cove know how to celebrate Christmas.

Visit her at www.DebbieMacomber.com.</p><br><br>"Mom!"<br><br>The front door slammed and Beth Morehouse hurried out of the kitchen. Three days before Christmas, and her daughters were home from college&#x2014;at last! Her foreman, Jeff, had been kind enough to pick them up at the airport while Beth dealt with last-minute chores. She'd been looking forward to seeing them for weeks. Throwing her arms wide, she ran toward Bailey and Sophie. "Merry Christmas, girls."<br><br>Squealing with delight, they dropped their bags and rushed into her embrace.<br><br>"I can't believe it's snowing. It's so beautiful," Bailey said, holding Beth in a tight hug. At twenty-one, she was the oldest by fourteen months. She resembled her father in so many ways. She was tall like Kent and had his dark brown hair, which she'd tucked under a knitted cap. Her eyes shone with a quiet joy. She was the thoughtful one and that, too, reminded Beth of her ex-husband. Three years after the divorce, she still missed him, although pride would never allow her to admit that. Even her budding relationship with Ted Reynolds, the local veterinarian, paled when she thought about her life with Kent and their history together.<br><br>"My turn." Displacing Bailey, Sophie snuggled into Beth's embrace. "The house looks fabulous, Mom. Really Christmassy." This child was more like Beth. A few inches shorter than her sister, Sophie had curly auburn hair and eyes so blue they seemed to reflect a summer sky. Releasing Beth, Sophie added, "And it smells wonderful."<br><br>Beth had done her best to make the house as festive and bright as possible for her daughters. She'd spent long hours draping fresh evergreen boughs on the staircase leading to the second-floor bedrooms. Two of the three Christmas trees were loaded with ornaments. The main tree in the family room was still bare, awaiting their arrival so they could decorate it together, which was a family tradition.<br><br>A trio of four-foot-tall snowmen stood guard in the hallway near the family room where the Nativity scene was displayed on the fireplace mantel. Decorating had helped take Beth's mind off the fact that her ex-husband would be joining them for Christmas. This would be the first time she'd seen him in three years. Oh, they'd spoken often enough, but every conversation had revolved around their daughters. Nothing else. No questions asked. No comments of a personal nature. Just the girls and only the girls. It'd been strictly business. Until now.<br><br>Until Christmas.<br><br>They both loved the holidays. It was Kent who'd first suggested they have several Christmas trees. Always fresh ones, which was one reason Beth had been attracted to the Christmas tree farm when she started her new life.<br><br>"I've got lunch ready," Beth said, trying to turn her attention away from her ex-husband. He still lived in California, as did the girls. He'd stayed in their hometown of Sacramento, while Bailey and Sophie both attended university in San Diego. According to their daughters, Kent had asked to come for Christmas. She'd known for almost two weeks that he'd made reservations at the<br><br>Thyme and Tide B and B in Cedar Cove. The news that he'd be in town had initially come as a shock to Beth. He hadn't discussed it with her at all. Instead, he'd had their daughters do his talking for him. That made everything more awkward, because it wasn't as if she could refuse, not with Bailey and Sophie so excited about spending Christmas together as a family. But Kent's plans had left her with a host of unanswered questions. Was this his way of telling Beth he missed her? Was he looking for a reconciliation? Was she? The questions swarmed in her head, but the answers wouldn't be clear until he arrived. At least she'd be better able to judge his reasons. His intentions. And her own...<br><br>"Just like it used to be," Bailey finished. Beth had missed whatever she'd said before that, although it wasn't hard to guess.<br><br><em>Just like it used to be.</em> These were magic words, but Beth had recognized long ago that the clock only moved forward. Yet the girls' eagerness, Kent's apparent insistence and her nostalgia for what they'd once shared swept aside her customary reserve.<br><br>"Mom?" Bailey said when she didn't respond. "We're talking...Where are you?"<br><br>Beth gave a quick shake of her head. "Woolgathering. Sorry. I haven't had much sleep lately." Exhausted as she was, managing the tree farm and getting ready for Christmas with her daughters&#x2014;and Kent&#x2014;she'd hardly slept. She couldn't. Every time she closed her eyes, Kent was there. Kent with his boyish smile and his eyes twinkling with mischief and fun. They'd been happy once and somehow they'd lost that and so much more. Beth had never been able to put her finger on what exactly had gone wrong; she only knew that it had. In the end they'd lived separate lives, going their own ways. Their daughters had kept them together&#x2014;and then they were off at college, and suddenly it was just Kent and Beth. That was when they discovered they no longer had anything in common.<br><br>"You're not sleeping?" Bailey's eyes widened with concern.<br><br>Sophie elbowed her sister. "Bailey, think about it. This is the busiest time of year for a Christmas tree farm. Then there's all this decorating. And, if we're really lucky&#x2014;"<br><br>"Mom made date candy?" Bailey cut in.<br><br>"And caramel corn?" Sophie asked hopefully, hands folded in prayer.<br><br>"Yes to you both. It wouldn't be Christmas without our special treats."<br><br>"You're the best mom in the world."<br><br>Beth smiled. She'd had less than three hours' sleep, thanks to all the Christmas preparations, her dogs and...her incessant memories of Kent. Traffic at the tree farm had thinned out now that Christmas was only three days away. But families were still stopping by and there was quite a bit to do, including cleanup. Her ten-man crew was down to four and they'd coped just fine without either her or Jeff this morning. While he drove out to the airport, she'd been getting ready for her daughters' arrival. However, as soon as lunch was over, she needed to head back outside.<br><br>Beth and the girls had booked a skiing trip between Christmas and New Year's, and after the hectic schedule of the past two months, she was counting on a few relaxing days with her daughters. Their reservations were made and she was eager to go. Ted Reynolds, good friend that he was, had offered to take care of her animals, which reminded her of the one hitch in her perfectly planned holiday escape.<br><br>"Before we sit down to eat, I need to tell you we have special guests this Christmas."<br><br>"You mean Dad, right?" Bailey led the way into the other room, where there was more greenery and a beautifully arranged table with three place settings.<br><br>"Well, yes, your father. But he's not the only one____"<br><br>"Mom." Bailey tensed as she spoke. "Don't tell me you have a boyfriend. It's that vet, isn't it?"<br><br>"Ten guests, actually," she said, ignoring the comment about Ted, "and they aren't all boys."<br><br>"Puppies?" Sophie guessed.<br><br>"Puppies," Beth confirmed, not surprised that her daughter had figured it out. "Ten of them."<br><br>"Ten?" Sophie cried, aghast.<br><br>Without asking, Bailey went straight to the laundry room off the kitchen. "Where did you get ten puppies?" The instant she opened the door, all ten black puppies scampered into the kitchen, scrambling about, skidding across the polished hardwood floor.<br><br>"They're adorable." Sharing Beth's love for animals, both girls were immediately down on the floor, scooping the puppies into their arms. Before long, each held at least two of the Lab-mix puppies, the little creatures intent on licking their faces.<br><br>Unable to resist, Beth joined her daughters and gathered the remaining puppies onto her lap. One curled into a tight ball. Another climbed onto her shoulder and began licking her ear. The others squirmed until one wriggled free and chased his tail with determined vigor, completely preoccupied. They really were adorable, which was good because in every other way they were a nuisance.<br><br>Sophie held a puppy to her cheek. "Where'd you get them, Mom?"<br><br>"They were.a gift," she explained, turning her face away to avoid more wet, slurpy kisses.<br><br>"A gift?"<br><br>"But why'd you take all ten?" Bailey asked, astonished.<br><br>"I didn't have any choice. They showed up on my porch in a basket a week ago." Beth didn't say that discovering these puppies had been the proverbial last straw. They'd literally appeared on her doorstep the same day she'd learned Kent was coming here for Christmas. For an insane moment she'd considered running away, grabbing a plane to Fiji or Bora-Bora. Instead, she'd run over to the Hardings' and ended up spilling her heart out to Grace. Under normal conditions, Beth wasn't one to share her burdens with others. However, this was simply too much&#x2014;an ex-husband's unexpected visit and the arrival of ten abandoned puppies, all during the busiest season of the year. The Hardings had given her tea and sympathy; Ted had been wonderful, too. Beth was grateful for his willingness to watch her animals but she refused to leave him with these ten additional dogs. So she'd made it her goal to find homes for all of them before Christmas. Which didn't give her a lot of time...<br><br>"How could someone just drop off ten puppies?" Bailey asked as she lifted one intrepid little guy off her shoulder and settled him in her lap.<br><br>"Who could do that and not be seen?" Sophie added. "I mean, you have people working all over this place."<br><br>Beth had certainly asked around. "Jeff saw a woman with a huge basket at my door. He thought he recognized her from his church, but when he asked her, she denied it. Then later, Pete, one of the drivers, claimed he saw a man on my porch with a basket. I talked to five different people and got five different stories. All I know is that I've got to find homes for these puppies before we leave for Whistler." And preferably before Kent arrived, although that was highly unlikely.<br><br>"Have you found any yet? " Bailey asked.<br><br>"No.but I've put out the word."<br><br>"You'll do it, Mom," Sophie said confidently. "I know you will."<br><br>"How old are they?" Bailey stroked a soft, floppy ear.<br><br>"Ted thinks about two months. Between six and eight weeks, anyway."<br><br>"They're irresistible. You won't have trouble finding homes," Sophie said.<br><br></p><h2>Sky Dragons: Dragonriders of Pern (Pern: The Dragonriders of Pern)</h2><p>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling mother-and-son team of Anne McCaffrey and Todd McCaffrey comes the final installment in the riveting Pern saga that began with Todd&#x2019;s solo novel, <i>Dragonsblood</i>. Now, with all of Pern imperiled by the aftereffects of a plague that killed scores of dragons and left the planet helpless against the fall of deadly Thread, the only hope for the future lies in the past.<br> &nbsp;<br> There, on an unexplored island, a group of dragonriders led by Xhinna, a brave young woman who rides the blue dragon Tazith, must battle lethal Merows and voracious tunnel-snakes to build a safe home for themselves and the dragons, whose offspring will one day&#x2014;if they survive&#x2014;replenish Pern&#x2019;s decimated dragon population. But as the first female rider of a blue dragon, and the first female Weyrleader in the history of Pern, Xhinna faces an uphill battle in winning the respect and loyalty of her peers . . . especially after an unforeseen tragedy leaves the struggling colony reeling from a shattering loss.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amid the grieving, one girl, Jirana, blessed&#x2014;or cursed&#x2014;with the ability to foresee potential futures, will help Xhinna find a way forward. The answer lies in time . . . or, rather, in <i>timing it:</i> the awesome ability of the dragons to travel through time itself. But that power comes with risks, and by venturing further into the past, Xhinna may be jeopardizing the very future she has sworn to save.</p><p>Anne McCaffrey's Pern series has been running successfully for so long that most of the Dragonriders' original problems have been solved. In <i>The Skies of Pern</i>, she confronts her standard cast of characters with the consequences of those solutions, consequences that are a whole new set of problems. Now that the Red Star has been pushed to another orbit, there will only be a few more ravenous Threads descending from it for them and their dragons to fight--and what role will that leave for them? They have successfully reclaimed Earth's lost technology--and suddenly everyone with a craft that might be outmoded, or who is phobic about surgery, is on the rampage, sabotaging and smashing and making up rumors. These fundamentalist Abominators are sure that something terrible will happen if the old ways are not gone back to--and sure enough, fire descends, on cue, from the skies.<p> Anne McCaffrey's tales of genetically engineered dragons and a lost colony that has declined into feudalism are ultimately SF rather than fantasy because they are about finding solutions to problems, solutions that involve working with what you are given to start off with; <i>The Skies of Pern</i> is all about elegant solutions to credible problems. <i>--Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Thanks to Anne McCaffrey, millions of readers have soared the skies on dragonback, shared the thoughts and dreams of the great dragons of Pern, and risked life and limb to safeguard the planet from the deadly threat of falling Thread. With the Dragonriders of Pern, McCaffrey has given us more than just an extraordinary masterwork of imagination. She has given us a whole world?and has taught us to fly. Now, in this triumphant return to Pern, Anne McCaffrey takes us on an adventure as surprising and unforgettable as any that has come before . . .<br><br>It is a time of hope and regret, of endings and beginnings. The Red Star, that celestial curse whose eccentric orbit was responsible for Thread, has been shifted to a harmless orbit, and the current Threadfall will be the last. Technological marvels are changing the face of life on Pern. And the dragonriders, led by F'lessan, son of F'lar and Lessa and rider of bronze Golanth, and Tia, rider of green Zaranth, must forge a new place for themselves in a world that may no longer need them.<br><br>But change is not easy for everyone. There are those who will stop at nothing? not even violence?to keep Pern and its people pure. And now a brand-new danger looms from the skies . . . and threatens a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. <br> <br>Once again, the world looks to the dragons and their riders to solve the crisis and save the world. But now, as the friendship of F'lessan and Tia begins to bloom into something more, unforeseen tragedy strikes: a tragedy destined to forever change the future?not just of the two young lovers, but of every human and dragon on Pern . . .<br><br></p><h2>The Etiquette of Freedom: Gary Snyder, Jim Harrison, and The Practice of the Wild</h2><p>Gary Snyder joined his old friend, novelist Jim Harrison, to discuss their loves and lives and what has become of them throughout the years. Set amidst the natural beauty of the Santa Lucia Mountains, their conversations harnessing their ideas of all that is wild, sacred and intimate in this world move from the admission that Snyder&#x2019;s mother was a devout atheist to his personal accounts of his initiation into Zen Buddhist culture, being literally dangled by the ankles over a cliff. After years of living in Japan, Snyder returns to the States to build a farmhouse in the remote foothills of the Sierras, a homestead he calls Kitkitdizze.<br><br>For all of the depth in these conversations, Jim Harrison and Gary Snyder are humorous and friendly, and with the artfully interspersed dialogue from old friends and loves like Scott Slovic, Michael McClure, Jack Shoemaker, and Joanne Kyger, the discussion reaches a level of not only the personal, but the global, redefining our idea of the Beat Generation and challenging the future directions of the environmental movement and its association with Deep Ecology.&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Etiquette of Freedom</i> is an all-encompassing companion to the film <i>The Practice of the Wild</i>.

Based on exclusive access to Cobains unpublished diaries, more than 400 interviews, four years of research, and a wealth of documentation, Heavier Than Heaven traces Cobains life from his early days in a double-wide trailer outside of Aberdeen, Washington, to his rise to fame, fortune, and the adulation of a generation.</p><p>The art of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was all about his private life, but written in a code as obscure as T.S. Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography <i>Heavier Than Heaven</i>, an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets, thanks to 400-plus interviews, and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created, how lies helped him die, how his family and love life entwined his art--plus, what the heck "Smells Like Teen Spirit" really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl, Cobain, and the "over-bored and self-assured" Tobi Vail, who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia, Washington, "outcast teen" underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like "Aneurysm" and "Drain You.") <p> Cross uncovers plenty of news, mostly grim and gripping. As a teen, Cobain said he had "suicide genes," and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family, then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet, popular teen athlete and sinister berserker, a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat, a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one), a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest, best friends. In fact, his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross, the coauthor of <i>Nevermind: Nirvana</i>, the definitive book about the making of the classic album, puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on <i>Nevermind</i> was a tidal slough, so nobody could sleep under it.) He gives the fullest account yet of what it was like to be, or love, Kurt Cobain. <i>Heavier Than Heaven</i> outshines the also indispensable <i>Come As You Are</i>. It's the deepest book about pop's darkest falling star. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>CHARLES R.

We used all verbs which have at least one tense, other than the present, documented as used by Greek writers. We considered it of little use to relist in a dictionary the approximately 8,000 verbs which occur in use only in the present tense. For similar reasons compound verbs, with very few exceptions, have not been included. Two criteria guided our selection of the forms: the frequency of their use and their intrinsic difficulty. Poetical forms or forms peculiar to literary dialects are distinguished by asterisks from those that occur in Attic prose or Koin�. Finally - and this constitutes the reason for this new collection - we have tried studiously to register only forms that are definitely documented, thus avoiding a usage that has become rather common in many scholarly grammars and even in some dictionaries: the accumulation of forms constructed by analogy which are not met in actual writings and only serve to swell the volumes and to complicate use.

In <i>Sister Parish Design</i>, Libby Cameron, Sister&#x2019;s last prot�g�, and Susan B. Crater, Sister&#x2019;s granddaughter, explore this aspect and much more in a series of conversations with the leading decorators of today. Sister Parish is the iconic American decorator of her generation. Her use of flowered chintzes and overstuffed armchairs combined with unexpected items, like patchwork quilts and painted furniture, is credited with popularizing what is known as American Country&#x2013;style during the 1960s. Her passion for bold color and mixed patterns invoked charm, imagination, and a lived-in look to her rooms. Her philosophy was to be unafraid and to put things together because you liked them--not because they matched. Filled with beautifully-rendered watercolor illustrations, <i>Sister Parish Desig</i>n is more then just a stunning book&#x2014;it is an inspirational resource that all decorating aficionados&#x2019; will want to add to their bookshelf. <p></p></p><p>SUSAN CRATER is the granddaughter of Sister Parish and co-author of <i>Sister: the Life of Legendary Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II. </i>LIBBY CAMERON worked for Sister Parish and now runs her own design firm. In 2001 they started SISTER PARISH DESIGN, a fabric and wallpaper company based on designs from the Parish-Hadley archives. Their products are frequently featured in magazines such as <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>House &amp; Garden </i>and <i>House Beautiful</i>. <p></p><b>SISTER PARISH DESIGN</b><br><b>OUR ROOMS</b><b>W</b>hen I was in college in New York I had the luxury and good fortune of visiting many spectacular houses with my grandmother Sister Parish when she called on her friends on the weekend. Sunday lunch was a popular time to entertain with her generation, and it is a shame this tradition has gone out of style in our busy lives. Dedicating a block of time to a Sunday lunch means you are really dedicating the entire day to leisure, as a big component of the Sunday lunch is a cocktail before lunch and wine during the meal, rendering you hopeless for whatever afternoon activities you had previously scheduled.Many of the houses I visited with Sister were unforgettable. Brooke Astor's house in Briarcliff, New York, stands out as the scene of colorful verbal skirmishes between Mrs. Astor and Sister, both very competitive women. It was also the most representative of a way of life we don't see anymore. All of the big houses in the country had pea stone driveways so the sound of cars on gravel was the first impression, followed by the smell of lovely pots of flowers surrounding the front door or wood smoke from the fire within, depending on the season. The door at Mrs. Astor's beautiful Georgian house would be opened by the familiar major domo of the house, whom my grandmother knew well as she visited often. Sister would always call out "hoo hoo," and the response from far away would be "we are in here," meaning in the beautiful large living room or a smaller cozy library that was almost a sun room. Usually a fire would be crackling and drinks offered up--sherry or something light. I remember the feeling of being frozen in time as we sipped our drinks and looked out at the beautiful gardens, chatted about the news of the day, and then went into the dining room for a traditional meal with lots of spirited conversation. Finally, completely satiated, there would be coffee back in the library or living room. Obviously the house's settings were amazing as Sister and Mrs. Astor had collaborated on its beautiful rooms, but more important, in that grand Georgian house one was made to feel comfortable and welcome. If we sat in the large living room, there were master paintings scattered about, but you never felt intimidated or overwhelmed. Seating arrangements were cozy and the upholstered furniture wonderfully comfortable.We had similar lunches at the Whitneys' house on Long Island, a rambling Dutch Colonial revival, which embodied a grand, yet livable country house, or her childhood friends' houses in New Jersey, typically smaller clapboard farmhouses filled with odd family heirlooms and bursting with color and charm. No matter the era of the house, the recipe was the same: extremely comfortable living rooms or libraries with brightly colored chintz and a mix of assorted eclectic family paintings and objects, delicious three-course meals that began with piping hot soups and finished with old-fashioned cakes and custards, and throughout, attention to the moment--no rushing to finish and get going. I don't think I ever saw anyone from that generation rush. It must have been considered very bad manners.The rooms that we visited in these great houses were well worn and well lived in. You had the impression that countless parties, family meals, or just plain hours of reading the Sunday paper had taken place in these rooms. That is what good decorating is--the transformation of a house to be aesthetically beautiful as well as useful for the family that lives there. Comfort and lack of intimidation were the foundation these houses were built on. It was not unusual to see a typically tattered dog bed underneath an old master painting. The rooms were designed to be used and they were, to their fullest.Billy Baldwin was a great proponent of urging his clients to live in their living rooms and he paid homage to Sister's living room in his discussion, "How to live in a living room," from the book <i>Billy Baldwin Decorates</i>, which includes some effective pointers:<i>When it comes to color think warm. Deep vibrant colors like brown, red, or burnt orange make a room intimate without reducing its size. I like to see furniture covered with chintz in a traditional room or with a wonderful contemporary pattern in a more modern room. I love to seeobjects around--not a clutter, but enough so everyone knows these rooms belong to someone--things happen here. One of the nicest living rooms in New York belonged to one of my colleagues, Mrs. Henry Parish II, who knows just how to live in a living room. The walls were dark brown. The curtains were the color of coral and there was wonderful English garden chintz on all of the big overstuffed chairs and sofas. She had arranged the furniture in three groups--one of them around the fire. Here was where she sat every day to have a cup of tea and read the mail. Here was where the family gathered drawn by the firelight on chilly afternoons. The room was equally beautiful when filled with people or when you were alone there. That is what I call a room that's lived in.</i>&nbsp;<br>-- SUSAN BARTLETT CRATER<b>LIVING ROOMS</b><i>Madame used to say, "We are not decorating--we are making places to live."</i>WILLIAM HODGINS&nbsp;<br>LIBBY CAMERON When we started with projects at Parish-Hadley, there was never a moment given to the possibility that any one of the rooms would not be used and loved and lived in. Each room was as important as the next although the purpose may have been different. And as I learned well, each room has to connect to the others, not in terms of the colors used, but in its aesthetic; each room needs to be its own while simultaneously being part of a whole. I remember Mrs. Parish talking about rooms and colors swearing at each other, and the importance of a thread that tied all of the rooms together. Comfort is an element that connects rooms and is what Parish-Hadley was known for. A room was never designed without thought given to how it would be used and what was important, how the light fell and how many people lived there, how the lamps or lighting in the room would draw you in and enable you to read.Living rooms were never planned with just one place to sit and often had three or more seating areas, and were cozy enough so that one or many people could be comfortable. Parish-Hadley was a wonderful school for so many. Ingrained in us all was the importance of imaginative warm rooms that had to be friendly, comfortable, and timeless.&nbsp;<br>MITCHELL OWENS What I think the "graduates" of Parish-Hadley have in common is a certain respect for history without being slavish, a breadth of vision that reveres quality over specific periods or styles, and an understanding of real comfort, no matter how formal the client's lifestyle. I don't think I've ever been in a room executed by a Parish-Hadley alum that isn't eminently livable. The rooms themselves may not be my cup of tea, per se, in terms oflooks, but the comfort level is pretty much steady across the board, don't you think? There's inherent practicality, too, an attention to the sorts of amenities that many designers of otherwise striking rooms often forget. (There is a world of difference between a room styled to be beautiful and a room that is actually decorated for living.) I once spent an evening at a star designer's apartment, and though the sitting room was spectacularly outfitted, I had to clutch my glass all evening--there was no place to set a drink down! That sort of foolishness would never occur in a room with a Parish-Hadley bloodline. At least, I hope not.&nbsp;<br>MARIO BUATTA The thing about English houses that is so great is that they are always played down with chintz and sisal carpeting. Sister did the same thing. She did not like a room that was only filled with "important furniture."&nbsp;<br>JANE CHURCHILL Obviously I come from a family of decorators, being Nancy Lancaster's niece; Nancy's sister, my grandmother Alice Winn, never worked as a decorator, but she had fantastically good taste and always did it much more on a shoestring. She could turn a hovel into something. I remember the house she had at Sandwich--a really nasty, suburban-looking brick house. By the time she added lattice balconies to it, painted it a different color, and planted a garden in front of it, it was drop-dead gorgeous. But she always did it in a much cheaper way than Aunt Nancy, not that money with Aunt Nancy was key. I will always remember she had something red in every room. They both had an eye for things that some people didn't seem to see. I think you are born with an eye or you're not. Nancy Lancaster and Alice Winn had incredibly wonderful, comfortable houses with bathrooms that always looked like other people's drawing rooms and my grandmother always had very, very good food. They were American. We were brought up with American backgrounds, not just a British background. In those days comfort was more unique. My cousin Lady Wissie Ancaster had wonderful taste, but that also came because she had the whole line of Aunt Nancy, Granny, and the whole lot in her. They didn't just make homes, they made wonderful homes. They were never pretentious.Nothing was ever pretentious. Dogs were everywhere, pee stains on the edge of the curtains. Not that it was ever dirty, but they were absolutely lacking in any form of pretention. They were such personalities themselves. The women had such energy.Nancy Lancaster was funny and amusing and she treated everyone the same, from a duke to the dustman, and they all adored her. She was really happy in her garden with all the gardeners. The staff she had was there for years and they all adored her because she was kind and funny. She always had an eclectic group of people around her. They were just very talented.&nbsp;<br>EMMA BURNS When I was working with Roger Banks-Pye, we were on the way to see a...</p><h2>Gates of Zion (Zion Chronicles, Bk. 1.)</h2><p>Out of the Ashes of the Holocaust, a Magnificent Novel of Indomitable Courage and Hope <p>Ellie, a young American photojournalist, finds herself in the Jerusalem of 1947.

Bodie&#x2019;s goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn&#x2019;t overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p><p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life. Reading opened the world to me. I began to write stories of my own." </p><p>By the young age of fourteen, Bodie had a job as a stringer reporter for The California Newspaper. "They paid me fifty cents an inch for one article a week. The most I ever made was twelve dollars, but I felt rich!" </p><p>Bodie continued her college education as a Journalism-Political Science major in San Jose, California. She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for U.S. News and World Report. Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches." </p><p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!" </p><p>Publication of The Fall Guy catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim. Shortly after that she went to work for John Wayne&#x2019;s Batjac Productions and ABC Television as a writer and researcher, working with the top writers in the motion picture industry.

Her work is currently featured in American West, Saturday Evening Post, and Smithsonian magazine, as well as other national publications. </p><p>Bodie&#x2019;s interest in Israel, which culminated in THE ZION CHRONICLES, stems from her days as a student. In 1978 she spoke to John Wayne about her hope to one day write a novel about the exciting events surrounding the rebirth of Israel. He encouraged her with his reply: "That&#x2019;s one you ought to do. It&#x2019;s the story of the Jewish Alamo!" </p><p>With the publication of the first book in THE ZION CHRONICLES&#x2014;The Gates of Zion&#x2014;she was awarded the Gold Medallion Book Award by the ECPA.</p></p><h2>Walking with Lincoln: Spiritual Strength from America&#39;s Favorite President</h2><p>Abraham Lincoln faced many serious challenges during his life.

His books have won international awards and acclaim and have been made into a TV series.Grade 4-7-An energetic cast brings to life Mossflower (Philomel, 1988), Brian Jacques' rip-roaringly entertaining animal fantasy, a prequel to Redwall. The actors bring conviction to their roles, whether playing brave mice, daft weasels, or ferocious furry villains. Mossflower tells of a tyrannical wildcat named Tsarmina, self-proclaimed Queen of the Thousand Eyes and ruler of Mossflower Woods. She has diabolical plans for the woodlanders, and listeners will delight in her melodramatic yowls and hisses as she plans to dominate every hedgehog, otter, or mouse who crosses her path. Fighting her are Martin the Warrior, a mouse whose bravery knows no bounds, and a funny minstrel mouse thief named Gonff. The latter's delightful songs are nicely performed. Various woodland creatures join Martin and Gonff in their fight, including two baby hedgehogs possessing delusions of grandeur. The story moves at a brisk pace as Martin, Gonff, and a mole named Dinny embark on a journey to Alamandastron, where they hope to find the legendary Boar the Fighter. Pursuing them are Tsarmina's hapless, bickering soldiers. A gifted writer (and narrator), Jacques makes each action scene crackle with energy. His cast is game from start to finish, playing each moment with a sense of fun and mischief. Some listeners may have trouble with the British accents at first, but those who stick with it will have a rollicking ride. Medieval music punctuates the end and beginning of each chapter.

Set aside.</p> <p>Pour the flour and yeast into a mixing bowl. Add the milk in a thin stream, mixing with a wooden spoon as you pour. Add 6 tablespoons of sugar and the egg yolk to the bowl and mix - the dough will start to come together rather shaggily. Add the melted butter to the mixture and the pinch of salt. Mix until a rough ball starts to form. Dump this ball onto a floured surface and knead for a few minutes until smooth. You may need to add a little flour to keep the dough from sticking, but don't add too much: you want the dough to still be soft and slightly floppy. Form the dough into a ball and place it in the buttered pan. Cover with a clean dish towel and put in a warm, draft-free place for an hour, or until the dough has doubled in bulk.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using your fingers, gently deflate the dough and push it out evenly to fit the pan. Do not push the edges up on the sides of the pan. Then dimple the dough all over with your fingers.</p> <p>Drop the diced butter into the dimples of the dough. Then sprinkle the entire cake with the remaining sugar. Cover the pan with the dishtowel again and let sit for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Put the pan in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and bubbling. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before cutting and serving. Zuckerkuchen is best served warm, the day it is made.</p> <p><b>A Conversation with Luisa Weiss</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Do you feel there is one key to successful home cooking? Some people seem innately more talented as cooks as others, but do you feel it is something anyone can do?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>I do think some people are better cooks than others in the way that some people are better at math than others and some are better at languages than others. That having been said, it seems to me that the simple act of cooking often is the best way to become a good cook. If you make a point of cooking every night or most nights of the week, it's hard to imagine that you won't, one day, become a good cook. Only by doing can you figure out what you like, what you're good at, what makes your culinary heart soar, what makes it sink. So the key to successful home cooking, in my opinion, is to cook. A lot!</p> <p><strong>Q. When returning to visit family in the United States, Germany or Italy, what is one dish you look most forward to eating in each of these countries? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>In the US: Chinese food. In Germany: Pflaumenkuchen (yeasted plum cake). In Italy: Pizza al taglio (pizza sold by weight)</p> <p><strong>Q. What is one thing most people would be surprised to learn about German cuisine? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>That it's a pretty seasonally driven cuisine. I'm not talking about restaurant fare, which seems to not have much variation, but what people cook at home. Plum cakes in plum season, asparagus only in the six weeks it's available in the markets, chanterelles only when you can buy them from people who picked them in their backyards that morning. It's true that the Germans do love themselves some sausages and potatoes, but that's not all there is to German cuisine.</p> <p><strong>Q. Why did you feel it was important to tell your story with <em>My Berlin Kitchen</em>?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>I've always felt pretty alone in the world with my weird situation, my parents so far apart, my life so split between such faraway places. I used to think I was the only person in the world who felt such loneliness--in my peer group, there was no one who had grown up like I did. Processing my life was a pretty solitary act. But when I wrote about little bits of it online, my readers responded to it with such compassion, sympathy and understanding that I realized that there were a lot of universal truths in my experience. Then, when I found myself at such a big crossroads, career-wise and in my personal life, and I felt brave enough to make all the big jumps that I did, I wanted to share what I'd learned. That despite terror and insecurity, living your life honestly is the best way to find happiness. Also, if I manage to make only one international mutt like me feel a little more understood and a little less alone in the world, writing the book will have been worth it.</p> <p>Download the extended Q&amp;A [PDF]</p>Luisa Weiss was born in West Berlin and spent her childhood between Berlin and Boston.

But while he has been widely extolled for his achievements, parts of Churchill&#x2019;s record have gone woefully unexamined.&nbsp;As journalist Madhusree Mukerjee reveals, at the same time that Churchill brilliantly opposed the barbarism of the Nazis, he governed India with a fierce resolve to crush its freedom movement and a profound contempt for native lives. A series of Churchill&#x2019;s decisions between 1940 and 1944 directly and inevitably led to the deaths of some three million Indians. The streets of eastern Indian cities were lined with corpses, yet instead of sending emergency food shipments Churchill used the wheat and ships at his disposal to build stockpiles for feeding postwar Britain and Europe.<p>Combining meticulous research with a vivid narrative, and riveting accounts of personality and policy clashes within and without the British War Cabinet, <i>Churchill&#x2019;s Secret War </i>places this oft-overlooked tragedy into the larger context of World War II, India&#x2019;s fight for freedom, and Churchill&#x2019;s enduring legacy. Winston Churchill may have found victory in Europe, but, as this groundbreaking historical investigation reveals, his mismanagement&#x2014;facilitated by dubious advice from scientist and eugenicist Lord Cherwell&#x2014;devastated India and set the stage for the massive bloodletting that accompanied independence.</p></p><p><b>Madhusree Mukerjee</b> won a Guggenheim fellowship to write her previous book, <i>The Land of Naked People</i>.

Skeletons. And particularly one, nicknamed 'Sailor.' What follows is a story about love, about family, about identity, about the unknown enemy, about the quest to unlock the hidden past--all propelled by a riveting mystery.<br><br>Unfolding against the deeply evocative background of Sri Lanka's landscape and ancient civilization, <b>Anil's Ghost</b> is a literary spellbinder--the most powerful novel we have yet had from Michael Ondaatje.</p><p>In his Booker Prize-winning third novel, <i>The English Patient</i>, Michael Ondaatje explored the nature of love and betrayal in wartime. His fourth, <i>Anil's Ghost</i>, is also set during a war, but unlike in World War II, the enemy is difficult to identify in the bloody sectarian upheaval that ripped Sri Lanka apart in the 1980s and '90s. The protagonist, Anil Tissera, a native Sri Lankan, left her homeland at 18 and returns to it 15 years later only as part of an international human rights fact-finding mission. In the intervening years she has become a forensic anthropologist--a career that has landed her in the killing fields of Central America, digging up the victims of Guatemala's dirty war. Now she's come to Sri Lanka on a similar quest. But as she soon learns, there are fundamental differences between her previous assignment and this one: <blockquote> The bodies turn up weekly now. The height of the terror was 'eighty-eight and 'eighty-nine, but of course it was going on long before that. Every side was killing and hiding the evidence. <i>Every side</i>. This is an unofficial war, no one wants to alienate the foreign powers. So it's secret gangs and squads. Not like Central America. The government was not the only one doing the killing. </blockquote> In such a situation, it's difficult to know who to trust. Anil's colleague is one Sarath Diyasena, a Sri Lankan archaeologist whose political affiliations, if any, are murky. Together they uncover evidence of a government-sponsored murder in the shape of a skeleton they nickname Sailor. But as Anil begins her investigation into the events surrounding Sailor's death, she finds herself caught in a web of politics, paranoia, and tragedy. <p> Like its predecessor, the novel explores that territory where the personal and the political intersect in the fulcrum of war. Its style, though, is more straightforward, less densely poetical. While many of Ondaatje's literary trademarks are present--frequent shifts in time, almost hallucinatory imagery, the gradual interweaving of characters' pasts with the present--the prose here is more accessible. This is not to say that the author has forgotten his poetic roots; subtle, evocative images abound. Consider, for example, this description of Anil at the end of the day, standing in a pool of water, "her toes among the white petals, her arms folded as she undressed the day, removing layers of events and incidents so they would no longer be within her." In <i>Anil's Ghost</i> Michael Ondaatje has crafted both a brutal examination of internecine warfare and an enduring meditation on identity, loyalty, and the unbreakable hold the past exerts over the present. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"Michael Ondaatje's novels swing on fiction's rope--they launch into a flight of myth, and are caught up once more in agile narrative hands. Like trapeze artists, they fly from one arm-straining gravity to another, across a shocking gap of weightlessness . . . Nowhere has Ondaatje written more beautifully . . .

The narrative, whose revelations have been building with a quiet ferocity, assumes the tension of a thriller, its chilling insights augmented by the visceral emotional effects that masterful literature can provide. More effective than a documentary, Ondaatje's novel satisfies one of the most exalted purposes of fiction: to illuminate the human condition through pity and terror. It may well be the capstone of his career.... Masterful."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"A truly wondrous book.

Ondaatje is a magnificent writer. Precision of expression, concision of thought, cleanness, clarity of detail permeate every page.

Flaherty asks fundamental questions rather than supply &#34;easy to apply&#34; tips and surface bandaids. &#34;Coaching is not telling people what to do; it&#39;s giving them a chance to examine what they are doing in the light of their intentions.&#34; (from the Preface) &#34;A coach is someone who builds a respectful relationship with a client and then researches the situations the client finds himself in, with particular emphasis on the client&#39;s interpretation of the events.&#34; (from Chapter 1) Then, in partnership with the client, the coach can work to altering actions to bring about expected outcomes. This book provides the language and operative principles and assessment models and sample coaching conversations necessary to do that.The book is grounded in many different paths of wisdom including time-tested philosophies, sociological premises and psychological discussions. Chapter bibliographies encourage further interdisciplinary reading.* Look at Chapter 8, &#34;Coaching Conversations.&#34; It is, perhaps, the longest chapter, but undoubtedly the most practical chapter as well, giving numerous types of coaching interventions from single conversations to multi-session programs. The types of conversations are divided into 3 levels of complexity.</p><h2>Meaning in History: The Theological Implications of the Philosophy of History</h2><p><p>Modern man sees with one eye of faith and one eye of reason. Consequently, his view of history is confused. For centuries, the history of the Western world has been viewed from the Christian or classical standpoint&#x2014;from a deep faith in the Kingdom of God or a belief in recurrent and eternal life-cycles. The modern mind, however, is <i>neither</i> Christian <i>nor</i> pagan&#x2014;and its interpretations of history are Christian in derivation and anti-Christian in result. To develop this theory, Karl L�with&#x2014;beginning with the more accessible philosophies of history in the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries and working back to the Bible&#x2014;analyzes the writings of outstanding historians both in antiquity and in Christian times. "A book of distinction and great importance. . . .

In this book, the capstone of her long career, Thomas, now eighty-eight, turns her keen eye to her own life. The result is an account of growing old that is at once funny and charming and intimate and profound, both a memoir and a life-affirming map all of us may follow to embrace our later years with grace and dignity. </p><p>A charmingly intimate account and a broad look at the social and historical traditions related to aging, <em>Growing Old</em> explores a wide range of issues connected with growing older, from stereotypes of the elderly as burdensome to the methods of burial humans have used throughout history to how to deal with a concerned neighbor who assumes you&#x2019;re buying cat food to eat for dinner. </p><p>Written with the wit of Nora Ephron&#x2019;s <em>I Feel Bad About My Neck</em> and the lyrical beauty and serene wisdom of <em>When Breath Becomes Air, Growing Old</em> is an expansive and deeply personal paean to the beauty and the brevity of life that offers understanding for everyone, regardless of age. </p></p><p><p>One of the most widely read American anthropologists, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas has observed dogs, cats, and elephants during her half-century-long career. In the 1980s Thomas studied elephants alongside Katy Payne&#x2014;the scientist who discovered elephants' communication via infrasound. In 1993 Thomas wrote <em>The Hidden Life of Dogs</em>, a groundbreaking work of animal psychology that spent nearly a year on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. Her book on cats, <em>Tribe of Tiger</em>, was also an international bestseller. She lives in Peterborough, New Hampshire, on her family's former farm, where she observes deer, bobcats, bear, and many other species of wildlife.</p>&#x201c;Written by one of our most distinguished observers of human and animal behavior who has now decided to observe herself, this book is a witty, wise, frank, and ultimately comforting look--from the inside out--at the universal experience of growing old.&#x201d; (<strong>Dale Peterson, author of&nbsp;<em>Jane Goodall: The Woman Who Redefined Man </em>and <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Ghosts of Gombe</em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a true gift.

She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>The third Phryne Fisher mystery is one of the standouts of the series, effortlessly matching a compelling plot with its irresistible heroine. Fisher and her faithful companion, Dot, narrowly escape death while riding on a train when Fisher awakens to find chloroform fumes have rendered the other passengers unconscious-before succumbing herself. When some order is restored, Fisher and Dot discover that an elderly woman who had been travelling with her daughter is missing. The police inquiry soon finds the woman's battered corpse, and Fisher is retained to solve the crime, doing so with her usual insight, pluck and style. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Craving roots, she buys her ancestral home, a Victorian house in the seaside resort town of Spring Lake, New Jersey. Her family sold the house in 1892, after one of Emily's forebears, Madeline Shapley, then a young girl, disappeared.<br> <br> As the house is renovated and a pool dug, a skeleton is found and identiWed as Martha Lawrence, a young Spring Lake woman who vanished several years ago. Within her hand is the Wnger bone of another woman, with a ring -- a Shapley family heirloom -- still on it. Determined to Wnd the connection between the two murders, Emily becomes a threat to a seductive killer...who chooses <i>her</i> as the next victim.</p><p>Emily Graham knows what it's like to have enemies. The pretty New York attorney--a millionaire due to a lucky stock market break--has been sued by her greedy ex-husband and stalked by a man who thinks she helped his mother's murderer escape punishment. But when she buys her great-great-grandmother's childhood home in the sleepy resort town of Spring Lake, Emily thinks her new life will be saner, even though five other young women, including Emily's ancestor Madeline Shapley, have disappeared from Spring Lake under creepy circumstances over the past century. <p> No sooner has Emily moved in than she starts receiving frightening, anonymous messages. Worse, when she breaks ground for a backyard pool, the backhoe brings up the body of Martha Lawrence, who vanished four years ago, and whose dead hand clutches the finger bone of Madeline Shapley, identified by her sapphire ring. Both women disappeared on September 7, 105 years apart. When the cops and Emily realize that a similar parallel exists between two other missing women and that the anniversary of yet another girl's disappearance is fast approaching, they quickly surmise that a sixth murder will be attempted in just a week. But by whom? Is today's serial killer a copycat of the Spring Lake murderer of the 1890s--or a reincarnation? Fueled by fear, anger, and scary little notes from the killer, Emily's actively researching the murders, but even she doesn't realize how many suspects there are: the retired college president, who's being blackmailed, and his perpetually angry wife; the town's bankrupt restaurateur with a weakness for pretty blondes; the middle-aged detective with his finger right on the pulse of the crimes. Even Emily's friend Eric, the software CEO who made her rich, and Nick, her new coworker, seem to show up at suspiciously convenient times. </p><p> Mary Higgins Clark's cast of characters may be overly large; in going for quantity she skimps on the characterization, and all of them, including Emily, are as wooden as Al Gore. But characterization isn't what's made this 24-book author a bestseller-list regular. The cleverly complex plot gallops along at a great clip, the little background details are <i>au courant</i>, and the identities of both murderers come as an enjoyable surprise. <i>On the Street Where You Live</i> just may be Clark's best in years. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>The #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark has written forty suspense novels, four collections of short stories, a his�torical novel, a memoir, and two children&#x2019;s books.

They succeed in their very dangerous task, but tensions remain high between Lucy and the other agents. Even the skull in the jar talks to her like a jilted lover. What will it take to reunite the team? Black marketeers, an informant ghost, a Spirit Cape that transports the wearer, and mysteries involving Steve Rotwell and Penelope Fittes just may do the trick.

Creating tension that ebbs and flows, he slowly builds the dramatic narrative to a resounding crescendo, and he makes the quieter scenes that follow just as compelling.

No political tract has motivated human beings in so many diverse societies to fight for political freedom as the Exodus story of God's liberation of the Israelite slaves--which shows that God intends that, ultimately, people be free.</p><p>The Bible's influence, however, has conveyed as much through its narratives as its laws. Its timeless and moving tales about the human condition and man's relationship to God have long shaped Jewish and Christian notions of morality, and continue to stir the conscience and imagination of believers and skeptics alike.</p><p>There is a universality in biblical stories:</p><p>The murder of Abel by his brother Cain is a profound tragedy of sibling jealousy and family love gone awry (see pages 11-14).</p><p>Abraham',s challenge to God to save the lives of the evil people of Sodom is a fierce drama of man in confrontation with God, suggesting the human right to contend with the Almighty when it is feared He is acting unjustly (see pages 32-34).</p><p>Jacob's, deception of his blind father, Isaac raises the timeless question: Do the ends justify the means when the fate of the world is at stake (see pages 46-55).</p><p>Encyclopedia in scope, but dynamic and original in its observations and organization, Biblical Lileracy makes available in one volume the Bible's timeless stories of love, deceit, and the human condition; its most important laws and ideas; and an annotated listing of all 613 laws of the Torah for both layman and professional, there is no other reference work or interpretation of the Bible quite like this Stunning volume.</p><p>Joseph Telushkin is a rabbi, scholar, and bestselling author of eighteen books, among them <em>A Code of Jewish Ethics</em> and <em>Words That Hurt, Words That Heal</em>. His book <em>Jewish Literacy</em> is the widest-selling work on the topic of Judaism. He lives with his wife, Dvorah, in New York City, and lectures regularly throughout the United States.</p></p><h2>Pray Big for Your Child: The Power of Praying God&#39;s Promises for Your Child&#39;s Life</h2><p>All parents want what's best for their children.

The story relates the cultural collision that occurs when Christian English missionaries arrive among the Ibos of Nigeria, bringing along their European ways of life and religion. In the novel, the Nigerian Okonkwo recognizes the cultural imperialism of the white men and tries to show his own people how their own society will fall apart if they exchange their own cultural core for that of the English.This is Chinua Achebe&#39;s classic novel, with more than two million copies sold since its first U.S. publication in 1969.

H. Almaas&#x2014;widely recognized as a leader in integrating spirituality and psychology&#x2014;has been developing and teaching the Diamond Approach, a spiritual path that integrates the insights of Sufism, Buddhism, Gurdjieff, and other wisdom traditions with modern psychology. In this new work, Almaas uses the metaphor of a "spacecruiser" to describe a method of exploring the immediacy of personal experience&#x2014;a way of investigating our moment-by-moment feelings, thoughts, reactions, and behaviors through a process of open-ended questioning. The method is called the practice of inquiry, and <i>Spacecruiser Inquiry </i> reveals what it means to engage with this practice as a spiritual path: its principles, challenges, and rewards. <br><br>The author explores basic elements of inquiry, including the open-ended attitude, the focus on direct knowledge, the experience of not-knowing, and the process of questioning. He describes the experience of "Diamond Guidance"&#x2014;the inner wisdom that emerges from our true nature&#x2014;and how it can be realized and applied. In this process Almaas looks at many of the essential forms of Diamond Guidance, including knowing, clarity, truth, love, intelligence, compassion, curiosity, courage, and determination. Also included are exercises and questions and answers from the original talks by Almaas on which the book is based.</p><p>A. H. Almaas is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of <i>Spacecrusier Inquiry</i>, <i>The Pearl Beyond Price</i>, <i>Facets of Unity</i>, and other books.&nbsp;<i> </i>"Readers of Almaas' previous books will not be disappointed. This new work is intended as a practical guide to applying the methodology of the Diamond Approach to personal inquiry. The true power of this book lies in its ability to address 'a part of us that does not inhabit the words in our mind but lives disguised in the varied content of our life.'"&#x2014; <i>NAPRA Review </i></p><h2>Not Taco Bell Material</h2><p><b>Now in paperback, Adam Carolla takes us back--before <i>Loveline </i>and <i>The Man Show</i>, before the Guinness World Record-breaking podcast and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks</i>--to reveal all the stories behind how he came to be the angry middle-aged man he is today.<br><br></b>Funnyman Adam Carolla is known for two things: hilarious rants about things that drive him crazy and personal stories about everything from his hardscrabble childhood to his slacker friends to the hypocrisy of Hollywood.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com.It had taken four months, calling in every favor ever owed her, a case of expensive Scotch and a date with a slimy private investigator who had made the mistake of thinking "date" meant "sex." A knee to the groin had cured him of that belief. In the end, Dana Birch had gotten her man.<br><br>Now, as she rode the elevator up to Garth Duncan's penthouse condo, she smiled at the paperwork in her hand. Paperwork that demanded he come talk to the good people at the Dallas Police Department. Paperwork that said Garth was going to have a very bad day. She, on the other hand, couldn't be happier.<br><br>"Rat bastard, weasel dog," she murmured as she stepped off the elevator and headed to his front door. "You thought you were so smart. You thought you could do whatever you wanted and get away with it. You thought you could hurt my friends."<br><br>If life were perfect, he would resist accompanying her and she could threaten him with her gun. Maybe even accidentally shoot him. If only he were the type of guy to cower in the face of authority, not to mention consequences. In her fantasies, he would tremble and beg. While it wasn't as good as watching him bleed, it would be a close second. Unfortunately Garth was more the type to have a thousand-dollar-an-hour attorney who lived to sue police departments. Not that his high-powered attorney would be much help today.<br><br>"You are so mine, Garth," she said, then knocked.<br><br>In the minute or so it took him to answer, she savored the victory. She'd worked hard to nail Garth and it had been worth every long hour of digging, following up clues and waiting for a lucky break. It was his own fault, she thought cheerfully. He'd messed with people she cared about. No one did that without having to face her.<br><br>The front door opened. She smiled as she saw Garth was half-concealed behind the door. Maybe he <i>was </i>afraid, she thought with a flicker of contempt.<br><br>She held out the papers. "Good morning. We're going to take a little ride downtown."<br><br>"Are we?" he asked as he opened the door wider, so she could see all of him. "Am I allowed to get dressed first?"<br><br>An unexpected twist, Dana thought grimly as she took in the towel draped around his neck, covering his chest, and the one around his waist. He was dripping, obviously just out of the shower. His dark hair stood in little spikes, his expression was far more amused than worried.<br><br>"At least you know I'm not armed," he said, his voice thick with humor.<br><br>"I wouldn't be afraid if you were."<br><br>"That's because you don't know what I'm capable of, Deputy Birch. So which is it? Are you prepared to parade me naked through the streets of Dallas or will I be putting on clothes?"<br><br>He sounded confident, as if he knew she wouldn't take him in a towel, which was true. Damn him. She liked situations where <i>she </i>was in charge.<br><br>"You can get dressed," she said grudgingly. "I'll need to be in the room, though, to make sure you don't try to escape."<br><br>He actually gave her a little wink. "Of course you will. That's as good an excuse as any."<br><br>Irritation coursed through her. Instinctively she rested her right hand on her sidearm. "You wish," she snapped. "Let me assure you I have no interest in seeing your bony backside. Or any other part of you."<br><br>One corner of his mouth turned up. "You can watch, Dana. I don't mind."<br><br>He was playing with her, trying to mess with her. She focused on the reason she was here.<br><br>"Joke all you want," she told him. "You're going to jail."<br><br>"If only wishing made it so."<br><br>"You're not getting out of this," she said. "I have the proof I need."<br><br>"No, you don't." His voice was low and deceptively soft. "If you had what you needed, you'd be arresting me, not bringing me in for questioning. Admit it, Dana. You're not even close to charging me with anything. This is a fishing expedition."<br><br>While she knew in her head that reacting with violence only weakened her position and proved he was right, she really, really wanted to hit him.<br><br>"I'm officially bored," she said, dropping her arm to her side. "Let's get this over with."<br><br>"The part where you watch me naked?"<br><br>She stepped into his condo and rolled her eyes. "Yeah. Lucky, lucky me. Have you been featured in <i>Arrogance Monthly </i>yet?"<br><br>"I've been on the cover."<br><br>He shut the door, then led the way through the large penthouse.<br><br>The main room was huge&#x2014;she was guessing she could fit her apartment and five others just like it in the space. There were floor-to-ceiling windows with a view of most of Dallas. Not that she cared about that sort of thing.<br><br>She returned her attention to the man in front of her, then frowned as sunlight caught his back, illuminating the scars crisscrossing his skin.<br><br>A few of them were thin lines, but most were thick and raised, as if the skin had been cut over and over again. Her stomach clenched slightly, not that she allowed her expression to change.<br><br>She knew the basic facts about Garth Duncan. He was rich&#x2014;scary rich, with dozens of companies and money flowing like water. He'd started in the oil business and while down in South America, no doubt raping and pillaging a pristine part of the world, he'd been captured and held prisoner by some angry locals. They'd kept him and a coworker blindfolded in the jungle for a month, torturing them both daily.<br><br>Her gaze dropped to his long, muscled legs. She could see faint scars there, too, but these had come from a surgeon. Both of Garth's legs had been broken during his captivity. His friend had carried him to safety.<br><br>If only Garth had died back then, Dana thought, but without a whole lot of energy. He wouldn't be hurting her friends. But he hadn't died. He'd come back home and flourished.<br><br>She followed a few steps behind as he entered a massive bedroom, then continued into a bathroom the size of a grocery store. That led into one of those fancy closets done in dark wood. All the clothes were perfectly organized by color. Shoes were lined up on racks.<br><br>She leaned against the doorway, never taking her eyes from him. "Anytime."<br><br>His dark gaze locked with hers. He seemed to be enjoying himself, which pissed her off. But once the investigation began, his attitude would change. She was bringing him in. For now, that was enough.<br><br>His smile returned. He pulled the towel off his shoulders and let it fall to the floor. "If you don't have to be anywhere in the next couple of hours, we could take advantage of my lack of clothes."<br><br>"Hours? Oh, please. You'd be lucky to last six minutes. Quit playing, Garth. I have a full day ahead of me. Despite what you think, the world doesn't revolve around you."<br><br>"Yes, Deputy Birch."<br><br>He dropped the towel at his waist.<br><br>She kept her eyes on his face. Not only didn't he interest her in the least, but she was here in a professional capacity. She was proud of her job and what she did for the community. The good people of her town didn't pay her to ogle the likes of Garth Duncan.<br><br>"No?" he asked, completely naked and holding out his arms at his side. "I'm yours for the taking."<br><br>She faked a yawn.<br><br>He laughed. A rich, full laugh that spoke of amusement and perhaps grudging respect. For reasons she couldn't explain, she found herself wanting to smile back at him. As if they were sharing a connection. As if they had something in common. As if they almost liked each other and might even be almost friends.<br><br>Dana turned and walked out of the closet. "Get dressed," she called as she went.<br><br>"What if I have a gun in here?" he yelled after her.<br><br>"Then I get to shoot you."<br><br>She crossed to the window in the bedroom and stared out at the view. But she only saw her friends' faces. The three sisters Garth was trying to ruin. He hadn't been content to attempt to destroy Lexi's business or ruin Skye's foundation. He'd actually tried to kill Izzy. What the hell was she thinking, smiling at him?<br><br>Garth was the enemy. He was evil. She was going to put him in prison for a very long time.<br><br>Five minutes later he walked into the bedroom. He wore a suit she was sure cost more than she made in a couple of months.<br><br>"Let's go," she said. "We'll take my car."<br><br>"I'm calling my lawyer on the way. She'll meet us at the police station."<br><br>"You can call Congress and God for all I care." She pointed to the hallway. "Move."<br><br>Instead of heading toward the living room, he moved toward her. For a split second Dana wondered if he had really had a gun in the closet. She reached for her sidearm.<br><br>"I didn't try to kill her," Garth said. "I had nothing to do with what happened to Izzy."<br><br>"I'mnot the one you have to convince," Dana told him.<br><br>"You're a cop. Look at me, Dana. Tell me if you think I'm lying." He stared into her eyes. "I didn't try to kill Izzy. I didn't cause the explosion. I never went after her at all."<br><br>He was standing too close, she thought suddenly. She wasn't worried about him coming after her, but she still felt uneasy. What was going on?<br><br>Hating to give up the power, she took a step back.<br><br>He was lying. He had to be lying. But the voice in her head that warned her when someone was trying to pull a fast one was oddly silent.<br><br>"I suppose you didn't do anything at all," she said, grabbing his arm and starting toward the hallway. "That you're completely innocent."<br><br>He only smiled.<br><br>He could have pulled away easily, but didn't, which left her in the uncomfortable position of hanging on to him. She could feel the heat of his skin, the muscles, the smooth fabric of his fancy suit.<br><br>"Don't mess with me," she growled.<br><br>"I didn't say a word."<br><br>So why did she feel so uncomfortable?<br><br>Weakness wasn't allowed, she reminded herself. Not with him, not with anyone.<br><br>"Please tell me they threatened you before I got there," Mary Jo Sheffield said as she and Garth walked toward her car. "I'm itching to file a lawsuit."<br><br>His attorney&#x2014;a fortysomething blonde who barely came to his shoulder&#x2014;looked determined. She could scent blood with the efficiency of a shark, one of the reasons he'd hired her.<br><br>"Sorry to disappoint you," Garth told her as he waited for her to unlock her Mercedes. "They were polite and didn't notify the press."<br><br>Mary Jo wrinkled her nose. "Tell me someone hit you or threatened to hit you. Tell me they manhandled your cat when they brought you in. I need something to work with here."<br><br>"I don't have a cat," Garth said.<br><br>"So few men do. Something I've never understood. Cats treat their owners with disdain and God knows your gender is constantly falling for women who treat them badly." Mary Jo grinned. "Sorry. Ignore the rant. So you're saying I can't sue the Dallas Police Department?"<br><br>"I'm saying I can't help you make your case."<br><br>"Damn."<br><br>She unlocked her car. Garth slid into the passenger seat.<br><br>He'd spent nearly six hours being questioned. Mary Jo had been present for all but the first thirty minutes. He'd been provided with coffee, sandwiches and plenty of breaks. It had been easy... too easy.<br><br>Deputy Dana Birch would be horrified if she found out, he thought, enjoying the thought of her screaming at some unsuspecting sergeant for not stringing Garth up by his thumbs and beating him with a pipe. If she had her way, he would be tortured into confessing all and then burned at the stake. Of course if she knew him, she would know torture wouldn't get him to talk. Fortunately for him, Dana wasn't in charge of the Texas criminal justice system.<br><br>"What about the deputy?" Mary Jo asked. "Deputy Birch. Can I go after her? What was she doing, bringing you in, anyway? She's not a member of the Dallas PD. She's from Titanville. There's something going on there. Maybe I can get her suspended."<br><br>"Leave Dana out of it," he said as they left the parking garage.<br><br>Mary Jo glanced at him, eyebrows raised. "Dana? You know her?"<br><br>"We've met."<br><br>"Tell me you're not sleeping with her, Garth. Tell me this isn't personal."<br><br>He chuckled. It was personal, but not in the way his attorney meant. "We're not involved or even friends. She's..."<br><br>Dana was his half sisters' friend. A deputy in the town where his mother lived. She was annoying, stubborn and determined to take him.<br><br>"She's a friend of the family," he said finally.<br><br>"I didn't know you had family."<br><br>"I'm more the type to have hatched?"<br><br>She sighed. "Fine. I won't sue Deputy Birch. But tell her to stay out of my way. She's trouble. I've had to deal with her in the past. I know the type. She's honest and loyal. You know how annoying those two traits can be."<br><br>He did. Once he'd believed in them. Lately though, he was more interested in results. An attitude that had cost him a lot but insured the win. And right now winning was all that mattered.<br><br>"I have the loan papers drawn up," Mary Jo said.<br><br>"Not to keep repeating myself, but you're totally insane. Jed Titan is never going to accept the terms of the loan. Even if he does need the money, he won't take it from you."<br><br>"He won't know it's me."<br><br>"He'll suspect."<br><br>"He won't have a choice. I'm continuing to buy up his company. The shareholders are getting nervous. They know I'm interested, but they don't know my end game, which is how I want it. Jed has had a lot of bad press lately. The possible treason charges alone cost his shareholders a lot of money as the price dipped."<br><br>Mary Jo glanced at him, then returned her attention to the road. "I find it interesting that the price of Jed's stock dropped right when you wanted to buy it."<br><br>"Funny how it all worked that way."<br><br>"Tell me you haven't broken the law."<br><br>"I have in no way violated Securities and Exchange Commissions guidelines or rules."<br><br>"Keep it in the gray area," his attorney advised.<br><br>He'd stepped far beyond that, but not in a way that could be traced to him. Most of his attacks on the Titan family had been more subtle. It kept things interesting.<br><br>"What happens now?" Mary Jo asked. "Or don't I want to know?"<br><br>"I go to work and start my day."<br><br>She glanced at him again. "You're not going to tell me what's really going on, are you?"</p><h2>The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War (A New History of the Peloponnesian War) (VOLUME 1)</h2><p><p>The first volume of Donald Kagan's acclaimed four-volume history of the Peloponnesian War offers a new evaluation of the origins and causes of the conflict, based on evidence produced by modern scholarship and on a careful reconsideration of the ancient texts. He focuses his study on the question: Was the war inevitable, or could it have been avoided?</p><p>Kagan takes issue with Thucydides' view that the war was inevitable, that the rise of the Athenian Empire in a world with an existing rival power made a clash between the two a certainty. Asserting instead that the origin of the war "cannot, without serious distortion, be treated in isolation from the internal history of the states involved," Kagan traces the connections between domestic politics, constitutional organization, and foreign affairs. He further examines the evidence to see what decisions were made that led to war, at each point asking whether a different decision would have been possible.</p></p><p><p>Donald Kagan is Sterling Professor of Classics and History at Yale University.</p><p>"Kagan's book is based on complete control of both the ancient evidence and modern scholarship."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Kagan's book is a contribution of considerable distinction, scrupulously fair, carefully argued, and lucidly written. And, what is more, it is persuasive.... Kagan sets out the story in detail and with acumen. The case has been adumbrated before&#x2015;but never presented with such thoroughness."</p> (<i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br><p>"The temptation to acclaim Kagan's four volumes as the foremost work of history produced in North America in the twentieth century is vivid.... Here is an achievement that not only honors the criteria of dispassion and of unstinting scruple which mark the best of modern historicism but honors its readers. To read Kagan's 'History of the Peloponnesian War' at the present hour is to be almost unbearably tested."</p> (George Steiner <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br><p>"A profound analysis of the relation of strategy to politics, a sympathetic but searching critique of Thucydides' masterpiece, and a trenchant assessment of the voluminous modern literature on the war."</p> (Bernard Knox <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>)</p><h2>The Wailing Siren Mystery (Hardy Boys, No. 30)</h2><p>Caught in their motorboat the <i>Sleuth</i> by a sudden storm at sea, Frank and Joe Hardy are relieved to see the lights of a yacht.

Few episodes in the development of scientific theory show so clearly how the solution to a highly technical problem can alter our basic thought processes and attitudes. Understanding the processes which underlay the Revolution gives us a perspective, in this scientific age, from which to evaluate our own beliefs more intelligently. With a constant keen awareness of the inseparable mixture of its technical, philosophical, and humanistic elements, Mr. Kuhn displays the full scope of the Copernican Revolution as simultaneously an episode in the internal development of astronomy, a critical turning point in the evolution of scientific thought, and a crisis in Western man's concept of his relation to the universe and to God. </p><p> The book begins with a description of the first scientific cosmology developed by the Greeks. Mr. Kuhn thus prepares the way for a continuing analysis of the relation between theory and observation and belief. He describes the many functions--astronomical, scientific, and nonscientific--of the Greek concept of the universe, concentrating especially on the religious implications. He then treats the intellectual, social, and economic developments which nurtured Copernicus' break with traditional astronomy. Although many of these developments, including scholastic criticism of Aristotle's theory of motion and the Renaissance revival of Neoplatonism, lie entirely outside of astronomy, they increased the flexibility of the astronomer's imagination. That new flexibility is apparent in the work of Copernicus, whose DE REVOLUTIONIBUS ORBIUM CAELESTIUM is discussed in detail both for its own significance and as a representative scientific innovation. </p><p> With a final analysis of Copernicus' life work--its reception and its contribution to a new scientific concept of the universe--Mr. Kuhn illuminates both the researches that finally made the heliocentric arrangement work, and the achievements in physics and metaphysics that made the planetary earth an integral part of Newtonian science. These are the developments that once again provided man with a coherent and self-consistent conception of the universe and of his own place in it. </p><p> This is a book for any reader interested in the evolution of ideas and, in particular, in the curious interplay of hypothesis and experiment which is the essence of modern science. Says James Bryant Conant in his Foreword: "Professor Kuhn's handling of the subject merits attention, for... he points the way to the road which must be followed if science is to be assimilated into the culture of our times." </p></p><p>In this study of the Copernican Revolution, the author brings to a common focus the considered approach of the historian, the technical understanding of the scientist and the skill and experience of an able teacher.<p>Thomas S. Kuhn was an American physicist, historian, and philosopher of science.</p></p><h2>The Lives of the Heart: Poems</h2><p>A new volume of poems by the award-winning author of <em>October Palace.</em></p><p>Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky writes that Jane Hirshfield "approaches the poem in a way that feels exactly right to me: plainly, reverently, intelligently." This is true both in her essays about poetry (see <i>Nine Gates</i>) and in her poems. Her recurrent themes of art, nature, and mystery startle the reader in many of these poems. Take, for example, the intriguingly titled "Lying," which is short enough to quote in its entirety: "He puts his brush to the canvas, / with one quick stroke / unfolds a bird from the sky. / Steps back, considers. / Takes pity. / Unfolds another."<p>The author of five previous poetry collections and a book of essays, Jane Hirshfield has been a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and England&#x2019;s T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and she is the winner of the Poetry Center Book Award, the California Book Award, and fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations. Her work has appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and multiple volumes of <em>The Best American Poetry</em> and <em>Pushcart Prize</em> anthologies.</p></p><h2>Sentinels of Fire: A Novel (P. T. Deutermann WWII Novels)</h2><p><p>P.T. Deutermann's World War II navy series began with the award-winning <i>Pacific Glory</i>, followed by the brilliantly reviewed <i>Ghosts of Bungo Suido</i>. His new novel <i>Sentinels of Fire</i> tells the tale of a lone destroyer, the <i>USS Malloy</i>, part of the Allied invasion forces attacking the island of Okinawa and the Japanese home islands.</p><p>By the spring of 1945, the once mighty Japanese fleet has been virtually destroyed, leaving Japan open to invasion. The Japanese react by dispatching hundreds of suicide bombers against the Allied fleet surrounding Okinawa. By mid-May, the Allied fleet is losing a major ship a day to murderous swarms of kamikazes streaming out of Formosa and southern Japan. The radar picket line is the first defense and early warning against these hellish formations, but the Japanese direct special attention to these lone destroyers stationed north and west of Okinawa.</p><p>One destroyer, the <i>USS Malloy</i>, faces an even more pressing issue when her Executive Officer Connie Miles begins to realize that the ship's much-admired Captain Pudge Tallmadge is losing his mind under the relentless pressure of the attacks. Set against the blazing gun battles created by the last desperate offensive of the Japanese, Executive Officer Miles and the ship's officers grapple with the consequences of losing their skipper's guidance&#x2015;and perhaps the ship itself and everyone on board. </p><p>Vividly authentic, historically accurate, and emotionally compelling, <i>Sentinels of Fire</i> is military adventure at its best, by an author whose career as a Navy captain informs every page.</p></p><p>P. T. DEUTERMANN is the author of sixteen previous novels, including <i>Ghosts of Bungo Suido </i>and <i>Pacific Glory</i>, which won the W. Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction. Deutermann spent twenty-six years in military and government service, which included a Pearl Harbor tour of duty; his father was a Vice Admiral in the WWII Pacific theater, and his uncle and older brother were submariners. He lives with his wife in North Carolina.<p>ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On my very first day aboard USS <i>Malloy,</i> a Jap fighter plane came within fifteen feet of taking my head right off before it exploded just above the water on the opposite side of the ship. The captain looked down at me from the bridge wing once all the shooting stopped, shot me a lopsided grin, and said, &#x201c;Welcome aboard, XO. How do you like your coffee?&#x201d;</p> <p>An hour later I thought of a truly smartass reply, but at that very moment, I was speechless and a bit deaf, too. I had literally just come aboard. The bridge messenger, a young seaman who looked to be no more than twelve years old, led me forward along the starboard side through all the guntubs to ascend the weather-deck ladders up to the bridge. We&#x2019;d gotten halfway up the first ladder when that kamikaze came in out of nowhere, its screaming engine audible above the sudden burst of fire from the midships forties, joined immediately by all the twenty-millimeter mounts. I had been standing underneath a four-barreled forty-millimeter gun mount when the gunners first spotted him. Every gun on that side opened fire. The messenger and I dropped back down to the main deck and huddled under the ladder to avoid the shower of brass cartridges raining down on our heads. The muzzle blasts were so powerful that I couldn&#x2019;t catch my breath, but that was nothing compared to seeing that Jap plane diving right at us, right at <i>me,</i> with that big, ugly bomb slung under its fuselage, even as pieces of its wings, tail, and undercarriage were being torn off by the gunfire from <i>Malloy</i>&#x2019;s massed batteries. At the last moment, the pilot lost either his nerve or his head, because the plane pitched up, rolled, and then kited right over the ship before crashing down into the sea, pursued by a sheet of flaming gasoline. A moment later there was a stupendous blast when its bomb went off just a few feet underwater, giving what was left of its pilot one last flight experience and raising a waterspout a hundred feet into the air.</p> <p>Only thirty minutes earlier, <i>Malloy</i> had finished taking on fuel and transferring personnel by midships highline alongside the fleet oiler, <i>Monongahela.</i> Once I landed on <i>Malloy</i>&#x2019;s main deck, shed my life jacket, and collected my seabags, I headed forward as the bosun&#x2019;s mates retrieved the highline rig and the ship pulled away from the oiler, accelerating to 27 knots to get clear of the cumbersome and vulnerable underway replenishment formation. It had been a gray, drizzly day, with enough wind to bat the tops off of the waves as <i>Malloy</i> threaded her way through all the carriers, battleships, and cruisers of Admiral Raymond Spruance&#x2019;s Fifth Fleet. Spruance had been conducting air strikes against Formosa and the Japanese home islands for the past three days, trying to reduce what was left of the Jap air forces before the invasion of Okinawa began. The Japs had reacted by throwing kamikazes at the fleet formations, with some success, unfortunately. I&#x2019;d transferred over to the oiler from the aircraft carrier <i>Franklin</i>&#x2014;the Big Ben, as she was known&#x2014;where I&#x2019;d been the gunnery officer, on my way to take over as executive officer in the destroyer <i>Malloy.</i> Career-wise, it was a pretty big step. Two days after I&#x2019;d transferred to the oiler, the Big Ben lost over eight hundred men in a kamikaze bombing attack and was so badly damaged that she had to retire to Pearl and, ultimately, to retirement status in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.</p> <p>The captain was back inside the pilothouse by the time I got to the bridge, talking to the ship&#x2019;s Combat Information Center, known as the CIC or Combat, on the tactical intercom, or the bitch-box. He acknowledged my presence with a casual wave, finished his conversation, and then got out of his chair to come shake hands. I introduced myself.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Connie Miles, Captain,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Reporting aboard for duty, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Pudge Tallmadge,&#x201d; he said as we shook hands. &#x201c;Welcome aboard. I&#x2019;m sorry your predecessor isn&#x2019;t here to do a proper turnover, but he was yanked off to go to command, and that does take precedence.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Amen to that,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to hit the deck running.&#x201d;</p> <p>The captain&#x2019;s nickname, Pudge, must have been strictly an academy thing, because he was anything but pudgy now. Gaunt would have been a better description, with gray hair, light blue eyes with dark pouches underneath, medium height, and a face that looked ten years older than his forty-one years of age. His real name was Commander Carson R. R. Tallmadge III, USN, and he was from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Annapolis class of 1929. He&#x2019;d been in command of <i>Malloy,</i> one of the new Gearing-class destroyers, since taking over from her commissioning CO right after that officer had suffered a heart attack in mid-1944.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go below,&#x201d; he said. He told the OOD&#x2014;officer of the deck&#x2014;that we&#x2019;d be in his inport cabin and to keep the ship at modified GQ, or general quarters, until we got back out to our assigned station, escorting a three-carrier formation. The captain&#x2019;s cabin was just on the other side of the wardroom. Once there he buzzed the duty wardroom steward for some coffee, lit up a cigarette, and then asked me to give him my background.</p> <p>&#x201c;Class of &#x2019;thirty-five,&#x201d; I recited. &#x201c;Served in the <i>West Virginia</i> for my makee-learn tour, then in <i>Chester</i> as main propulsion assistant. Postgrad school back in Annapolis, then back to sea in <i>Houston</i> out of Norfolk as the assistant gunnery officer. A year and a half of shore duty at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where the EDOs tried to convert me to engineering duty officer. That looked pretty boring to me, so I turned &#x2019;em down, which apparently hurt their feelings, because I was sent back to sea midtour to the Big E, again as assistant gunnery officer, right after Pearl.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You were aboard for Midway, then?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Actually, I was supposed to have gone to <i>Yorktown,</i> but that got changed at the last minute.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That was lucky,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, I thought so, especially after she went down. Went to <i>Franklin</i> from <i>Enterprise,</i> this time as <i>the</i> gunnery officer. Got off her to come here only days before the Japs got her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Lucky again,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good. I firmly subscribe to what Napoleon said when he was asked if he preferred brilliant generals or lucky ones. Lucky, every time, he said. Are you married?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, sir, I am not. Almost, once, but then she got cold feet after one of the wives at a wardroom dinner party told her what married life with a naval officer was like: the constant separations; a lot of responsibility but really low pay; the stagnant promotion system; and then some more about the endless separations. She was a bit tipsy, but she was pretty convincing. My fianc�e asked me later if that was all true, and I had to admit that it was. That, as they say, was that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sorry to hear it,&#x201d; the captain said. &#x201c;All of those things are true, or were, I guess. My wife&#x2019;s one of those special women who can live their own lives when I&#x2019;m gone, and yet make mine worth living when I&#x2019;m home. About the only thing that&#x2019;s changed is the promotion opportunity: You know, enough people die, the survivors get promoted. You&#x2019;re lucky you and she explored the truth before you got hitched.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She was a lovely young lady, but she was pretty clear on what she wanted out of marriage: kids, a nice home, a nice car, and an expanding horizon. This was about the time we were all taking a fifteen percent pay cut if we wanted to stay on active duty.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Remember it well,&#x201d; he said, nodding. &#x201c;And we were glad to hand it over, as I remember. It beat going on the bread lines or shoveling dirt for the WPA.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wavered,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Almost got out. Madge, that was her name, Madge Warrren, got her father into it. He tried to convince me that a career in banking was a whole lot better than a naval career. Having watched most of the banks fail when I was still at the academy, I wasn&#x2019;t convinced.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What happened to her, may I ask?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She married a banker and became an alcoholic. I guess I was lucky to have dodged a bullet. In a manner of speaking.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Well, speaking of luck, we&#x2019;re going to need as much of that as we can get, and all because we have one of the newer air-search radars.&#x201d;</p> <p>That was interesting&#x2014;we&#x2019;d had two air-search radars on Big Ben, but he was talking as if <i>Malloy</i>&#x2019;s having one was unusual. &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;L-day for the Okinawa campaign has been set of the first of April. Operation Iceberg, they&#x2019;re calling it. Gonna be a really big deal, Connie. Upwards of fifteen hundred ships and amphibious craft. A four-division assault, two Army, two Marine, almost 120,000 men, with the entire Big Blue Fleet in support. That&#x2019;s where we and our air-search radar come in. Spruance has ordered up a radar picket line, north and west of the main island of Okinawa. Six destroyers, augmented with some modified landing craft for additional close-in gun support, stationed in a big arc across the top of the island chain.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember hearing anything about a picket line for Iwo.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t, because Iwo is six hundred and fifty miles away from the home islands. Okinawa, on the other hand, is only two hundred and twenty miles. Okinawa is considered by the Japs to be Japanese home island territory. They&#x2019;ve got the entire Jap 32nd Army on that island, and the intel people are predicting a bloodbath.&#x201d; He sipped some of his coffee. I noticed his hand was trembling.</p> <p>&#x201c;If you were on the <i>Franklin,</i>&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;then you know that the Japs are on the ropes. For all intents and purposes, their fleet&#x2019;s been destroyed. They&#x2019;ve resorted to kamikaze tactics pretty much because that&#x2019;s all they&#x2019;ve got. Fleet intel estimates that they don&#x2019;t have all that many airplanes and pilots left, either, especially pilots, so they&#x2019;re making them count.&#x201d;</p> <p>Well I knew. We&#x2019;d been the target of all too many kamikazes recently in <i>Franklin,</i> and, being the gunnery officer, I knew all about the horror show they could produce. Fortunately <i>Franklin</i> had been surrounded by a screen of antiaircraft light cruisers and destroyers, together with the side batteries of two battleships, so it was pretty rare that one got through. &#x201c;Will this picket line be a formation, Captain?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so, Connie. It looks like we&#x2019;re going to be on our own, stationed maybe ten, twenty miles apart, to create the biggest possible radar coverage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One ship on its own? That&#x2019;s a recipe for disaster.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do tell. It&#x2019;s one thing to defend against a plane trying to bomb or torpedo a moving ship. Quite another when the plane <i>is</i> the bomb. Fleet intel says they&#x2019;ll soon run out of planes. I&#x2019;m not so sure. I think they&#x2019;re holding back until we actually attack Okinawa. Remember, Okinawa Shima <i>is</i> Japan in their evil little minds.&#x201d;</p> <p>I nodded. I&#x2019;d heard much the same scuttlebutt on board the Big Ben. The carriers were the queen bees of the fleet and often carried flag officers, which meant that officers stationed aboard a carrier knew more about what was happening in the big picture than, say, officers in a destroyer. Since I was the new guy here, however, it wouldn&#x2019;t do for me to come across as some know-it-all, even if I was to be the second in command.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can you tell me about the department heads, Captain?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Absolutely, and we&#x2019;re lucky to have four good ones. The whole wardroom is actually way above average. Let&#x2019;s see. The senior one is Lieutenant Jimmy Enright, the navigation officer, sometimes called the ops officer. UCSD grad, headed for law school but came in after Midway. Did one tour on a light cruiser, then showed up for the precommissioning detail for <i>Malloy.</i> He&#x2019;s bright, a thinker, loves his electronic toys and knows more about them than some of his people. Married, two little kids. Ask him a complicated question and he&#x2019;ll think about it first, then come up with an answer you didn&#x2019;t expect.</p> <p>&#x201c;The gun boss is Marty Randolph. Southerner, another lieutenant, academy, &#x2019;forty-two, commissioned right after Pearl, pretends to be a good ol&#x2019; boy but actually stood tenth in his class. Championship diver back at the boat school. Loves his guns and his gunners, and they worship him. Also loves to fight Japs, and his men know that and respond accordingly. He can absorb a tactical situation and split out the main battery on the fly. Not married, but I&#x2019;m told there is a Southern belle somewhere back home, dutifully pining away amongst the magnolias.</p> <p>&#x201c;Chief engineer is Mario Campofino, not an engineer by trade or nature but a very demanding and precise young officer. OCS out of NYU, did one tour in the <i>Indianapolis</i> as a makee-learn and then, like you, fleeted up to main propulsion assistant, which, on a heavy cruiser, says a lot. Again, he was part of the precomm detail for <i>Malloy.</i> Has a great rapport with his chiefs, whom he trusts, as well he should. But when it comes to running the main engineering plant, he&#x2019;s by the book, all the way. Calm, cool, never loses his temper, unlike the gun boss. Confirmed bachelor, or so he says.</p> <p>&#x201c;Finally, Peter Fontana, lieutenant jay-gee, the supply officer. I forget his college, some Podunk U in the Midwest. Supply School, of course, then OCS. Everything tends to amaze Peter, so he&#x2019;s very careful. Going to be an accountant one day if we survive this fight. He&#x2019;s a natural born bean counter. Didn&#x2019;t understand what his real mission was when he first came aboard, but he does now, and he&#x2019;s become really good at it. He oversees the handiest collection of midnight-requisition artists I&#x2019;ve ever seen. We go alongside a tender and they will rob that ship blind of all the stuff we&#x2019;re not authorized to have. When they get caught, Peter puts on such a good act of ninety-day-wonder innocence that it is truly amazing to behold. The tender&#x2019;s people know we&#x2019;re guilty, but they&#x2019;re so impressed with this amazingly gullible LTJG Fontana act that they forget to come get their stuff back.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The goat locker?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The chiefs&#x2019; mess is strong. There are a couple of chiefs whom <i>I</i> would not have promoted, but that&#x2019;s just your fleet average situation. <i>Your</i> right-hand man is going to be the chief master at arms, Chief Wallace Lamont, a Scottish-descent bantam rooster with the unlikely nickname of Pinky. Red hair, ruddy face, faintly pink eyes. Even so, he&#x2019;s one of those guys you recognize immediately as someone you don&#x2019;t want to piss off. He&#x2019;s half the size of most of the crew, and yet no one crosses that man under any circumstances. Your predecessor depended on him absolutely. He told me more than once that nothing goes on in this ship that Lamont doesn&#x2019;t already know about, and if it&#x2019;s a problem, he&#x2019;s usually already taken care of it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sounds damned useful,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How do I play him?&#x201d;</p> <p>The captain sat back in his chair with an amused look. He closed his eyes for a moment. Then he surprised me. &#x201c;What do you think your job is here, as XO?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Run the ship the way you want it run so that you look good.&#x201d;</p> <p>He chuckled. &#x201c;Who told you that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Commander Randy Marshal, XO in the <i>Franklin.</i> Unfortunately, I understand he died in the big fire.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the traditional approach, but these days, out here, it bears no relation to reality, Connie, especially on a destroyer. Let me tell you what&#x2019;s real. In the old days, four-stripers got command by staying healthy long enough to outlive their seniors while not getting caught consorting with goats. That took some time, which meant many skippers were graybeards by the time the war started. I was on one of the cruisers sunk at Sa...</p></p><h2>Enough About Love: A Novel by the Bestselling Author of The Anomaly</h2><p><i>Any man&#x2014;or woman&#x2014;who wants to hear nothing&#x2014;or no more&#x2014;about love should put this book down.</i><br><br>Anna and Louise could be sisters, but they don&#x2019;t know each other. They are both married with children, and for the most part, they are happy. On almost the same day, Anna, a psychiatrist, crosses paths with Yves, a writer, while Louise, a lawyer, meets Anna&#x2019;s analyst, Thomas. Love at first sight is still possible for those into their forties and long-married. But when you have already mapped out a life path, a passionate affair can come at a high price. For our four characters, their lives are unexpectedly turned upside down by the deliciously inconvenient arrival of love. For Anna, meeting Yves has brought a flurry of excitement to her life and made her question her values, her reliable husband, and her responsibilities to her children. For Louise, a successful career woman in a stable and comfortable marriage, her routine is uprooted by the youthful passion she feels for Thomas. Thought-provoking, sophisticated, and, above all, amusing, <i>Enough About Love</i> captures the euphoria of desire through tender and unflinching portraits of husbands, wives, and lovers.</p><p><p>Herv� Le Tellier is a writer, a journalist, a mathematician, a food critic, and a teacher.&nbsp; He has been a member of the Oulipo since 1992 and one of the &#x201c;papous&#x201d; of the famous France Culture radio show.

The effects of spiritual practices are now being investigated scientifically as never before, and many studies have shown that religious and spiritual practices generally make people happier and healthier. Rupert Sheldrake summarizes the latest scientific research on what happens when we take part in these practices, and suggests ways that readers can explore these fields for themselves. For those who are religious, Science and Spiritual Practices will illuminate the evolutionary origins of their own traditions and give a new appreciation of their power. For the non-religious, this book will show how the core practices of spirituality are accessible to all, even if they do not subscribe to a religious belief system. This is a book for anyone who suspects that in the drive towards radical secularism, something valuable has been left behind. Rupert Sheldrake believes that by opening ourselves to the spiritual dimension we may find the strength to live more wholesome and fulfilling lives.</p><p>Dr Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author of more than eighty technical papers and ten books, including A New Science of Life. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, where he was Director of Studies in cell biology, and was also a Research Fellow of the Royal Society.

Follow Rupert on Twitter @RupertSheldrake. His web site is www.sheldrake.orgThere is something rather odd about the current state of science. For Rupert Sheldrake, [it is] facing a &#39;credibility crunch&#39; on many fronts. He presents this challenging argument by identifying &#39;ten core beliefs that most scientists take for granted.&#39; He then interrogates each in turn by reformulating it, in the spirit of radical scepticism, as a question. This Socratic method of inquiry proves surprisingly illuminating. A serious mind-expanding book. * Spectator * Certainly we need to accept the limitations of much current dogma and keep our minds open as we reasonably can. Sheldrake may help us do so through this well-written, challenging and always interesting book. * Financial Times * Rupert Sheldrake does science, humanity and the world at large a considerable favour. * The Independent * Sheldrake will be seen as a prophet. * The Sunday Times * Praise for the Science Delusion * : * I love this book! Few living scientists have the courage and the verve to ask the questions Rupert does, research them, and deliver answers in language all can understand. Be prepared as you read this book for an exciting and free-ranging ride, a sort of scientific pilgrimage journeying into spiritual practices and how they have benefited and can benefit humanity. * Matthew Fox, spiritual theologian and author of Original Blessing, The Reinvention of Work, and Meister Eckhart: A Mystic-Warrior for Our TImes * Urgent, vital, gently devastating, and an exhilarating read. Buy it, read it, and give it to all your friends and all acolytes of scientism. Sheldrake will help us stay alive and be more alive. We all need his help. * Charles Foster, Fellow of Green Templeton College, University of Oxford, and author of Being a Beast * I have personally adopted many of the practices Rupert describes in his book and experienced more love, joy, empathy, gratitude and equanimity as a result. We are all indebted to Rupert who has tirelessly brought us deep insights from both science and spirituality. * Deepak Chopra * I thought I was undergoing a mild mid-life crisis, but after reading Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s book I realise that - despite being a lifelong non-believer - I was actually embracing various rituals employed by followers of all major world religions to bring themselves closer to their particular deity...it&#39;s fascinating to learn that the pursuits that I, and many of my peers, are embracing aren&#39;t simply badges of incipient middle-age, but proven mood-enhancers employed by all cultures throughout history. * Mail on Sunday *</p><h2>Shark Wars #4: Kingdom of the Deep</h2><p>Shark Wars grows more epic--and addictive--with every book, publishing each season!<br><br>Peace has finally come to the Big Blue and with it a revelation: Gray is not the last megalodon in the ocean after all.

It tells the story of Aref Al-Amri, who must say good-bye to everything and everyone he loves in his hometown of Muscat, Oman, as his family prepares to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan. This is acclaimed poet and National Book Award Finalist Naomi Shihab Nye's first novel set in the Middle East since her acclaimed <em>Habibi</em>.</p><p>Aref Al-Amri does not want to leave Oman. He does not want to leave his elementary school, his friends, or his beloved grandfather, Siddi. He does not want to live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his parents will go to graduate school.

They visit the camp of a thousand stars deep in the desert, they sleep on Siddi's roof, they fish in the Gulf of Oman and dream about going to India, and they travel to the nature reserve to watch the sea turtles. At each stop, Siddi finds a small stone that he later slips into Aref's suitcase&#x2014;mementos of home.</p><p>Naomi Shihab Nye's warmth, attention to detail, and belief in the power of empathy and connection shines from every page.

However, most teachers &#x2013; general and special educators &#x2013; are poorly prepared to be successful in inclusive classrooms and schools. Undoubtedly, the challenge to professionals involves the acquisition of new knowledge and skills. But inclusion requires far more. It calls upon educators to trouble everything they think they know about disability, to question their deepest ethical commitments, to take up the work of the Disability Rights Movement in the public schools, and to leap headlong into the deepest waters of the rich craft tradition of inclusive teaching. This book offers educators the guidance and resources to become great inclusive educators by engaging in a powerful process of personal and professional transformation.</p><p>Scot Danforth is Professor and Director of the School of Teacher Education at San Diego State University. He is a leading scholar in the fields of disability studies in education and inclusive education. His previous books include <i>The Incomplete Child: An Intellectual History of Learning Disabilities, Vital Questions Facing Disability Studies in Education</i> (with Susan Gabel), and <i>Disability and the Politics of Education: An International Reader</i> (with Susan Gabel).�The best educators (and policy leaders, administrators, teachers, parents, students) know that in order to transform the lives of students everyone associated with schooling also requires transformation. In thoroughly captivating prose, <i>Becoming a Great Inclusive Educator</i> shows the way. Recognizing disability as a natural form of diversity, this book embraces struggle and exudes hopefulness. It is a richly drawn handbook that lays bare the history, theory, ethical underpinnings, caring practice, and everyday narratives of optimism in deeply imagined inclusive schooling that can make schools whole.� (Douglas P.

It was, as Allyson Hobbs writes, a chosen exile, a separation from one racial identity and the leap into another. This revelatory history of passing explores the possibilities and challenges that racial indeterminacy presented to men and women living in a country obsessed with racial distinctions. It also tells a tale of loss.</p><p>As racial relations in America have evolved so has the significance of passing. To pass as white in the antebellum South was to escape the shackles of slavery. After emancipation, many African Americans came to regard passing as a form of betrayal, a selling of one&#x2019;s birthright. When the initially hopeful period of Reconstruction proved short-lived, passing became an opportunity to defy Jim Crow and strike out on one&#x2019;s own.</p><p>Although black Americans who adopted white identities reaped benefits of expanded opportunity and mobility, Hobbs helps us to recognize and understand the grief, loneliness, and isolation that accompanied&#x2015;and often outweighed&#x2015;these rewards. By the dawning of the civil rights era, more and more racially mixed Americans felt the loss of kin and community was too much to bear, that it was time to &#x201c;pass out&#x201d; and embrace a black identity. Although recent decades have witnessed an increasingly multiracial society and a growing acceptance of hybridity, the problem of race and identity remains at the center of public debate and emotionally fraught personal decisions.</p></p><p>Allyson Hobbs is Assistant Professor of History at Stanford University.&#x201c;[An] incisive cultural history... [Hobbs] takes nothing at face value&#x2015;least of all the idea that the person who is passing is actually and truly of one race or the other... [A] critically vigilant work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Danzy Senna</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A book that is at once literary, cultural, archival and social, crossing the borders of various approaches to the study of history in order to create a collage of a fascinating yet elusive phenomenon. Intrigued by the story of a distant relative who crosses the color line, Hobbs has followed this interest to explore the practice of passing with detail and rigor. Her writing is elegant, bubbling with curiosity even as it is authoritative and revelatory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Imani Perry</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book is an admirable effort to catalogue the myriad classifications of race in America, to develop a taxonomy of biases that endure even as the country&#x2019;s complexion changes.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joshua Cohen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Harper&#x2019;s</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] excellent book... Hobbs populates her book with figures from the past who expose the motivations for &#x2018;passing&#x2019; as white, and the costs. Necessarily, Hobbs writes, passing involves erasure: gradations gone, subtleties of color and culture reduced to black and white. What&#x2019;s lost in the process: families and friends, a sense of belonging. <i>A Chosen Exile</i> illuminates those losses with acuity, rigor, and compassion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Julie Orringer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Paris Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hobbs provides fresh analysis of an oft-ignored phenomenon, and the result is as fascinating as it is innovative. She foregrounds the sense of loss that passing inflicted, and argues that many of those who were left behind were just as wounded and traumatized as those who departed. Those who passed may have had much to gain, but what were the hidden costs, the invisible scars of enforced patterns of subversion and suppression? She suggests that the core issue of passing is not what an individual becomes, but rather &#x2018;losing what you pass away from.&#x2019; By turning safe assumptions inside out, Hobbs questions some of the longest-held ideas about racial identification within American society.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Catherine Clinton</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Passing, as Allyson Hobbs describes in this brilliant, fascinating new study, is itself as fluid, complex, and contradictory as our ideas of race.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kate Tuttle</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;By investigating the binary lives of the so-called ghosts that exist in American history, Hobbs raises important questions and ideas about race relations and the &#x2018;lost&#x2019; histories of African American communities.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cicely Douglas</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In narrating the lives of Americans at the border of whiteness, Hobbs illuminates our understanding of our country&#x2019;s tortured race history and of the injustices that drove people to make the ultimate migration&#x2015;out of the tyranny of enslavement and the terrors of Jim Crow to the costly privilege of the larger white world. Their anguish, alienation, and constant fear of discovery are brilliantly and painfully rendered in this important book, and, through them, we see the arbitrariness of race and the origins of racial divisions that we live with to this day.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Isabel Wilkerson, author of <i>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America&#x2019;s Great Migration</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With remarkable research and deep feeling for her subjects, Hobbs uncovers the stories of countless Americans of African descent who severed their family ties to pass into a world where they would be accorded the privileges of whites. At turns sad, inspiring, and provocative, the book raises important questions about the enduring power of race in American life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martha A.

From an early age, she was his eager eating companion and developed a diverse palate that relished everything from egg creams to oysters to blue cheese. Their dining ventures morphed into joint cooking get-togethers where dad instilled the notion that a meal made for one's family is an expression of love. This is evident in the simple and mostly healthy recipes she shares, as prepared for family and friends, in this warm and inviting collection. Paltrow showcases a wealth of dishes, from soups to pastas to main courses and more. Highlights include fried rice with kale and scallions, sole � la grenobloise, and her mother's blueberry muffins. A helpful pantry section includes recipes for basics such as slow-roasted tomatoes and numerous types of stocks. While many recipes are vegetarian, Paltrow does include meat dishes, including cheesy stuffed burgers and cassoulet. Her chapter on side dishes is superb and appealing enough to take center stage, especially her saut�ed greens with onions and soy sauce, maple-Dijon roasted winter vegetables, and crispy potato and garlic cakes. Filled with charming personal anecdotes, this book convinces that healthy food can be delicious as well as good for you&#x2014;and that a father's passion can endure.

With Waterland he won the Guardian Fiction Prize, and with Last Orders the Booker Prize. Both novels have since been made into films. Graham Swift&#39;s work has appeared in over thirty languages.ONCE UPON A TIME,&nbsp;before the boys were killed and when there were more horses than cars, before the male servants disappeared and they made do, at Upleigh and at Beechwood, with just a cook and a maid, the Sheringhams had owned not just four horses in their own stable, but what might be called a &#x201c;real horse,&#x201d; a racehorse, a thoroughbred. Its name was Fandango. It was stabled near Newbury. It had never won a damn thing. But it was the family&#x2019;s indulgence, their hope for fame and glory on the racecourses of southern England. The deal was that Ma and Pa&#x2014;otherwise known in his strange language as &#x201c;the shower&#x201d;&#x2014;owned the head and body and he and Dick and Freddy had a leg each.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about the fourth leg?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh the fourth leg. That was always the question.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For most of the time it was just a name, never seen, though an expensively quartered and trained name. It had been sold in 1915&#x2014;when he&#x2019;d been fifteen too. &#x201c;Before you showed up, Jay.&#x201d; But once, long ago, early one June morning, they&#x2019;d all gone, for the strange, mad expedition of it, just to watch it, just to watch Fandango, their horse, being galloped over the downs. Just to stand at the rail and watch it, with other horses, thundering towards them, then flashing past. He and Ma and Pa and Dick and Freddy. And&#x2014;who knows?&#x2014;some other ghostly interested party who really owned the fourth leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had a hand on her leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the only time she&#x2019;d known his eyes go anything close to misty. And she&#x2019;d had the clear sharp vision (she would have it still when she was ninety) that she might have gone with him&#x2014;might still somehow miraculously go with him, just him&#x2014;to stand at the rail and watch Fandango hurtle past, kicking up the mud and dew. She had never seen such a thing but she could imagine it, imagine it clearly. The sun still coming up, a red disc, over the grey downs, the air still&nbsp;crisp and cold, while he shared with her, perhaps, a silver-capped hip flask and, not especially stealthily, clawed her arse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> BUT SHE WATCHED&nbsp;him now move, naked but for a silver signet ring, across the sunlit room. She would not later in life use with any readiness, if at all, the word &#x201c;stallion&#x201d; for a man. But such he was. He was twenty-three and she was twenty-two. And he was even what you might call a thoroughbred, though she did not have that word then, any more than she had the word &#x201c;stallion.&#x201d; She did not yet have a million words. Thoroughbred: since it was &#x201c;breeding&#x201d; and &#x201c;birth&#x201d; that counted with his kind. Never mind to what actual purpose.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 1924. It wasn&#x2019;t June, but it was a day like June. And it must have been a little after noon. A window was flung open, and he walked, unclad, across the sun-filled room as carelessly as any unclad animal. It was his room, wasn&#x2019;t it? He could do what he liked in it. He clearly could. And she had never been in it before, and never would be again.<br> &nbsp;<br> And she was naked too.<br> &nbsp;<br> March 30th 1924. Once upon a time. The shadows from the latticework in the window slipped over him like foliage. Having gathered up the cigarette case and lighter and a little silver ashtray from the dressing table, he turned, and there, beneath a nest of dark hair and fully bathed by sunshine, were his cock and balls, mere floppy and still sticky appendages. She could look at them if she liked, he didn&#x2019;t mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then he could look at her. She was stretched out naked, except for a pair&#x2014;her only pair&#x2014;of very cheap earrings. She hadn&#x2019;t pulled up the sheet. She had even clasped her hands behind her head the better to look at him. But he could look at her. Feast your eyes. It was an expression that came to her. Expressions had started to come to her. Feast your eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside, all Berkshire stretched out too, girded with bright greenery, loud with birdsong, blessed in March with a day in June.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was still a follower of horses. That is, he still threw money away on them. It was his version of economising, to throw money away. For nearly eight years he&#x2019;d had money for three, in theory. He called it &#x201c;loot.&#x201d; But he would show he could do without it. And what the two of them had been doing for almost seven years cost, as he would sometimes remind her, absolutely nothing. Except secrecy and risk and cunning and a mutual aptitude for being good at it.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they had never done anything like this. She had never been in this bed before&#x2014;it was a single bed, but roomy. Or in this room, or in this house. If it cost nothing, then this was the greatest of gifts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though if it cost nothing, she might always remind him, then what about the times when he&#x2019;d given her sixpences? Or was it even threepences? When it was only just beginning, before it got&#x2014;was it the right word?&#x2014;serious. But she would never dare remind him. And not now anyway. Or dare throw at him the word &#x201c;serious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat on the bed beside her. He ran a hand across her belly as if brushing away invisible dust. Then he arranged on it the lighter and ashtray, retaining the cigarette case. He took two cigarettes from the case, putting one in her own proffered, pouting lips. She had not taken her hands from the back of her head. He lit hers, then his. Then, gathering up the case and lighter to put on the bedside table, he stretched out beside her, the ashtray still positioned halfway between her navel and what these days he would happily, making no bones about it, call her &#x201c;cunt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cock, balls, cunt. There were some simple, basic expressions.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 30th. It was a Sunday. It was what used to be known as Mothering Sunday.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;WELL,&nbsp;you have a gorgeous day for it, Jane,&#x201d; Mr. Niven had said as she brought in fresh coffee and toast.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said and she&#x2019;d wondered quite what he meant by &#x201c;it&#x201d; in her case.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A truly gorgeous day.&#x201d; As if it were something he had generously provided. And then to Mrs. Niven, &#x201c;You know, if someone had told us it was going to be like this, we might as well have all packed hampers. A picnic&#x2014;by the river.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He said it wistfully, yet eagerly, so that, putting down the toast rack, she&#x2019;d thought for an instant there might actually be a change of plan and she and Milly would be required to pack a hamper. Wherever the hamper&nbsp;<i>was</i>, and whatever they were supposed to put in it at such inconsiderate notice. This being&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;day.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Mrs. Niven had said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s March, Godfrey,&#x201d; with a distrusting glance towards the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, she&#x2019;d been wrong. The day had only got better.<br> &nbsp;<br> And anyway the Nivens had their plan, on which the weather could only smile. They were to drive to Henley to meet the Hobdays and the Sheringhams. Given their common predicament&#x2014;which only occurred once a year and only for a portion of one day&#x2014;they were all to meet for lunch at Henley and so deal with the temporary bother of having no servants.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the Hobdays&#x2019; idea&#x2014;or invitation. Paul Sheringham was to marry Emma Hobday in just two weeks&#x2019; time. So the Hobdays had suggested to the Sheringhams an outing for lunch: an opportunity to toast and talk over the forthcoming event, as well as a solution to Sunday&#x2019;s practical difficulty. And then because the Nivens were close friends and neighbours of the Sheringhams and would be honoured guests at the wedding (and would have the same difficulty), the Nivens&#x2014;as Mr. Niven had put it to her when first notifying her of these arrangements&#x2014;had been &#x201c;roped in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This had all made clear one thing she knew already. Whatever else Paul Sheringham was marrying, he was marrying money. Perhaps he had to, the way he got through his own. The Hobdays would be paying in two weeks&#x2019; time for a grand wedding, and did you really need to celebrate a forthcoming celebration? Not unless you had plenty to spare. It might demand nothing less than champagne. When Mr. Niven had mentioned the hamper he had perhaps been wondering how much the Hobdays&#x2019; liberality could be relied on or how much the day might involve his own pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that the Hobdays had plenty to spare pleased her. It had nothing to do with her, but it pleased her. That Emma Hobday might be made of five-pound notes, that the marriage might be an elaborate way of obtaining &#x201c;loot,&#x201d; pleased or, rather, consoled her. It was all the other things it might entail that&#x2014;even as Mr. Niven explained about the &#x201c;roping in&#x201d;&#x2014;gnawed at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> And would Mister Paul and Miss Hobday be joining the party themselves? She couldn&#x2019;t really ask it directly, vital as it was to her to know. And Mr. Niven didn&#x2019;t volunteer the information.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you mention these arrangements to Milly? None of it of course need affect&#x2014;your own arrangements.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not often that he had the occasion to say such a thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A jamboree in Henley, Jane. A meeting of the tribes. Let&#x2019;s hope we have the weather for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what &#x201c;jamboree&#x201d; meant, though she felt she had read the word somewhere. But &#x201c;jam&#x201d; suggested something jolly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope so too, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> AND NOW&nbsp;they clearly had the weather for it, and Mr. Niven, whatever his earlier misgivings, was indeed getting rather jolly. He was going&nbsp;to be driving himself. He had already announced that they might as well set off soon, so they could &#x201c;pootle around&#x201d; and take advantage of such a lovely morning. He wouldn&#x2019;t, apparently, be calling on Alf at the garage, who&#x2014;for the right sum&#x2014;could become a convincing chauffeur. In any case, as she&#x2019;d observed over recent years, Mr. Niven liked driving. He even preferred the pleasure of driving to the dignity of being driven. It gave him a boyish zest. And as he was always saying, with a whole variety of intonations, ranging from bluster to lament, times were changing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once upon a time, after all, the Nivens would have met the Sheringhams at Sunday service.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tribes&#x201d; had suggested something hot and outdoors. She knew it was to be the George Hotel in Henley. It was not to be a picnic. And it might well have been a day, since it was still March, of evil gales, even snow. But it was a morning like a morning in summer. And Mrs. Niven left the table to go up to get herself ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> She couldn&#x2019;t ask, even now with Mr. Niven conveniently alone, &#x201c;Would Miss Hobday and...?&#x201d; Even if it sounded like just a maid&#x2019;s idle curiosity. Wasn&#x2019;t the coming wedding the only current talking-point? And she certainly couldn&#x2019;t ask, &#x201c;If not, then what other separate arrangements might the two of them have in mind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t think that if she were one half of a betrothed couple&#x2014;or at least Paul Sheringham&#x2019;s half&#x2014;she would want, two weeks before their wedding, to attend a jamboree in Henley to be fussed over by the older generation (by what he might have called&#x2014;she could see him speaking with a cigarette in his mouth and wincingly screwing up his eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;three bloody showers together&#x201d;).<br> &nbsp;<br> But in any case, if she got no further information, it still left the problem that was peculiarly hers on this day, as Mr. Niven knew, of what to do with it. Today it was painfully peculiar. The gorgeous weather didn&#x2019;t necessarily help at all. It only seemed&#x2014;with two weeks to go&#x2014;to deepen a shadow.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was going to say to Mr. Niven, when the moment came, that if he&#x2014;if he and Mrs. Niven&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t mind, she might not &#x201c;go&#x201d; anywhere. She might just stay here at Beechwood and read a book if that was all right&#x2014;&#x201c;her book&#x201d; as she might put it, though it belonged to Mr. Niven. She might just sit somewhere in the sunshine in the garden.<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew that Mr. Niven could only approve of such a harmless suggestion. He might even think it was a rather appealing image. And of course it would mean she&#x2019;d be ready to resume her duties at once, whenever they returned. She could find something to eat in the kitchen. Milly, before she left, might even make her a sandwich. She could have her own &#x201c;picnic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And it might even have happened just like that. The bench in the nook by the sundial. Bumblebees tricked by the weather. The magnolia tree already loaded with blossom. Her book on her lap. She knew which book it would be.<br> &nbsp;<br> So&#x2014;she would put the idea to Mr. Niven.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then the telephone had rung and&#x2014;it being one of her numberless duties&#x2014;she&#x2019;d hastened to answer it. And her heart had soared. That was a phrase you read in books, but it was sometimes actually true of what happened to people. It was true then of herself. Her heart had soared, like some stranded heroine&#x2019;s in a story. Like the larks she would hear in a little while, trilling and soaring high in the blue sky, as she pedalled her way to Upleigh.<br> &nbsp;<br> But she&#x2019;d been careful to say, quite loudly, into the receiver and with her best answering-the-telephone voice that was both maid-like and somewhat queenly, &#x201c;Yes, madam.&#x201d;</p><h2>Fables Vol. 22: Farewell</h2><p>The <i>New York Times </i>Best-selling Series and Winner of 14 Eisner Awards!<br><br>Completing more than thirteen years of critically-acclaimed storytelling, FABLES #150 is here!<br><br>Doubling as the final volume of the series, creator Bill Willingham, artist Mark Buckingham and a host of the industry&#x2019;s finest artists deliver the end to this legendary Vertigo series that sees the final fates of beloved characters Bigby Wolf, Snow White, Rose Red, Boy Blue, Pinocchio and countless others.

Writing in hyper-intelligent Benzedrine prose that calls to mind Jack Kerouac and Hunter S. Thompson, he eschewed all conventional thinking as he discussed everything from Black Sabbath being the first truly Catholic band to Anne Murray&#x2019;s smoldering sexuality. In <b>Mainlines, Blood Feasts, Bad Taste</b> fellow rock critic John Morthland has compiled a companion volume to <b>Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung</b>, the first, now classic collection of Bangs&#x2019;s work. Here are excerpts from an autobiographical piece Bangs wrote as a teenager, travel essays, and, of course, the music pieces, essays, and criticism covering everything from titans like Miles Davis, Lou Reed, and the Rolling Stones to esoteric musicians like Brian Eno and Captain Beefheart. Singularly entertaining, this book is an absolute must for anyone interested in the history of rock.</p><p>Lester Bangs wrote for <i>Creem, the Village Voice</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i>.<br><br>John Morthland, co-executor of the Bangs literary estate, was a colleague of Bangs from 1969 until the author's death.

I was over at my girlfriend Andy's today listening to my new William Burroughs album for the first time (it just came in the mail) when suddenly they shouted for me from the bedroom. When I went in Andy's mother told me the news. Somehow I got the feeling they were expecting me to get distraught or something, so I faked this bunch of guffaws. Actually the news had no effect on me, at least no kind that could be measured positively or negatively, except that kind of vibration that sudden real-life surrealism sets off in you. It blew my mind is what I meant to say. When you say "Blow my mind," you don't mean anything to do with sadness or happiness, you mean WHAM!, the sudden impact of something outrageous, incredible, unthinkable, and I guess you could say that that's a positive feeling. Andy's mother went on to say blandly: "Some New York woman art critic shot him. Blew his whole head right off."<br><br>"What?! Is he dead then?"<br><br>Andy started to laugh. Her mother corrected her own surrealism (Burroughs had just been saying on the phonograph, "Trak news service. . . We don't report the news we write it"): "No, he's just in the hospital in critical condition." I went back into the living room and wrote on the paper slipcover from inside my Burroughs album: "June 3, 1968-Day Andy Warhol was assassinated." It looked better that way than if I'd wrote "Day Andy Warhol was shot."<br><br>Maybe I should be more concerned. Warhol used to be one of my heroes. Of course, I didn't know a damn thing about him, hadn't seen any of his movies or very many of his paintings, but I'd seen a TV show on him with the Velvet Underground playing that blew my mind, and I read what I could here and there in the magazines. Somewhere along in there I bought a giant poster with his face and sunglasses on it, and kept the thing up for months. It's not much to look at, or rather it wasn't, it's dead now. . . . I mean it wasn't one of these psychedelic-rococo things you can stare at for hours. As a matter of fact it was ugly, downright, and after a while the only reason I kept it up was that I wanted pictures on my wall and it was big. Back when I first got it I kept it right across from my bed and at night in the darkness I would stare at the face, trying to simulate perceptual drug experience, until it changed. But the changes never had much definition, not much showed in that face, it was just a famous face, incredibly blank and perhaps that was its claim to fame. Without the sunglasses he looked like a typical fey faggot, but with shades he achieved this rubbery cement look, a cement wall. Gradually over the months I began to find out that Warhol had little or nothing to do with the movies under his name. Roger met Warhol (or an imposter, as has been rumored since) and Paul Morrissey, who seems to be the real man responsible for the films, when they came to lecture at San Diego State. I wasn't there, but again Warhol came across as a catatonic if anything. When I moved to Broadway the poster went up in the living room there, and one night when they were all on acid and all equally bum-tripped, Jerry Luck fastened his paranoia on the Warhol poster: "I can't stand that guy, he's always looking at me! Ugh, that face!"<br><br>"The cat hassling you?" I sympathized.<br><br>"Man, I can't stand it! I'd like to rip that fucker into a million pieces! All the time I feel him staring at me, every motherfucking time I look around I see him staring at me like that, an' I hate the fucker, I hate 'im!"<br><br>I was in a very ironic/sarcastic mood that night, so I said: "Well, man, if he bothers you that much, rip the shit out of him! The poster belongs to me and I don't mind. Go ahead . . . fuck 'im up!"<br><br>"Really? I can?"<br><br>"Shore, go right ahead, have a ball!"<br><br>Everybody else made noises of disgust or told Luck to cool it. For a brief moment there was an odd suspenseful lull, and then he sprang at the poster and ripped it off the wall with a gurgling cry. Flopping about on the floor like a beached octopus, he tore it into a scattered litter of small pieces, snarling. Then he sat up, scratching his head, and looked around the room dazedly. I looked at him curiously. The others had made even more disgusted noises. Someone told him to clean up the mess, and he grumbled just like he did the night that he and Dan and Roger stole a chicken from some neighbor and he cleaned and plucked it on our kitchen floor, taking a bite from its bloody crotch to prove his Class.<br><br>But to get back to the assassination; when I got home that night my mother met me at the door with the news. She said he had been shot by his "girlfriend." Later Roger came over, and was predictably shocked when I dropped the bomb, gasping wide-eyed and staggering around the room a moment with his hand to his head. I don't think this was so much an indication that Warhol held some dear place deep in his heart, as an example of his typical response when his mind is blown.<br><br>Yesterday Andy Warhol was shot in his New York office, today Robert Kennedy in an L.A. hotel lounge just as he was finishing his victory speech after winning the California primary. And just two months ago, almost to the day, Martin Luther King, a far better man than either of the other two, was murdered in Memphis by a hired assassin who still eludes the FBI. Who next? What next? Andy and I were sitting in the den about half past midnight browsing a state college catalog when her mother shouted from the bedroom, "Andy! Come quickly! Bobby Kennedy's been shot!" We ran down the hall to sit dazedly watching the strange milling m�lange on the screen, nervous confused newscasters their voices breaking as they interviewed witnesses most of whom had differing stories, cameras blurring in and out of focus again and again, pandemonium, a harried cop shouting for everyone to clear the room but breaking off in mid-sentence as he saw a CBS man two feet away holding his microphone out to a witness, muddy charcoal semidarkness on the screen as they doused the lights in the lounge in an unsuccessful attempt to clear it, hearing an account later of the tense moments right after the shooting when photographers and reporters and bystanders crowded in so close over Kennedy and the two other wounded individuals that the senator (prone on the floor with blood all over his face, hands, and hips) finally had to cry out for some air, his mob was suffocating him . . . saw the would-be assassin dragged out surrounded by a tough contingent of a couple dozen cops pushing through the crowd, their captive barely glimpsed between trunks of cops as he hung half-limp yet his muscles tightened trying to roll himself almost into a fetal ball with arms defensively over the crown of his head . . . another supposed assassin got away . . . Andy was sobbing. Her mother clucked about "This country, I don't know . . ." and said to Paul: "Paul, let's move to Australia." Andy declared fiercely through her tears: "I'll bet it was one of those McCarthyites!" She is, predictably, a fanatical Kennedy supporter. I'm for McCarthy. Earlier in the evening, she had been crying, "nearly distraught" as she herself put it at the prospect, which seemed quite likely then according to network projections, of Kennedy's defeat. I watched the TV coverage of the immediate aftermath of his shooting with my jaw hanging, stupefied and shocked in the same way I'd been those interminable leagues of moments that I sat in the Angels' living room watching the progress of their gang rape. The data on the TV began to repeat itself: no new developments. I said good night to Andy and drove to Valley Liquor to pick up some Ezerase typing paper for the philosophy paper I'd planned to write on this all-night speed session. As I paid for it I casually said to the clerk, "Dja hear the news about Bobby Kennedy?" and he said, passing time of day with customer, "Yeah . . . they're gonna hafta stop doing those things."<br><br>Andy called me to report through tears that Senator Kennedy was still on the operating table, seven hours since the shooting, she says they got him through the shoulder, neck, and one big corner clipped off the skull behind an ear, three bullets through the smiling young presidential hopeful, and she has sat all night in front of the TV speeding and crying, while I've sat puffing panting with the sustained sex joy of plumbing this my Mainline, jugular vein of memories, convictions of the head and reachings-out of heart all years for some crystalline totality, and this is it, I can't cry this morning, even though America is disintegrating with a rapidity that's even shocking some of the dissidents, with an immutable beam-cracking ruination exceeding the wildest projections of those wooly insurgents America internalized from Tom Paine Franklin and the rest, as I feel the total tornado of the cosmos whirling 'round me "like a Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath," as all the Grossmont Junior College speakers used to say muckraking at tournaments until poor wop Jacuzzi's millions-maker became a clich� representing the very epitome of our American "decadence," I feel ecstatic chills swirling up and pouring down my limbs and trunk as a day and night of methedrine slowly flakes from me like dried paint flakes from the barnacled bow of a gargantuan ocean liner, all night these mounting hours Senator Robert Kennedy slowly dying on L.A. operating table of sterile stainless steel I've been plumbing this Mainline's depths, new literature aborning in here my recent speed sessions, when that methedrine's in my blood and that blood is in my head, something new, I keep returning in allusions to the Velvet Underground, no, specifically, Lou Reed, mind made it out of New York maelstrom halfway intact, now I pick up his messages thanx to the R&amp;R Renaissance the massive push of record companies hustling like mad beetles after hog-slopping troughs brimful of dollar bills, remember Grand Guy Grand's trick and people diving shamelessly into the massive vat of shit and piss and blood and pus and snot and come etc. after seasoning of U.S. greenbacks in the filth, everything flows in and lawd we're all sittin' pretty have been how long now? But confidentially although it shore ain't no secret I feel the lid's about to blow. Driving Andy to school. Suddenly, after half our transit done in silence, she says: "America is disintegrating, Les."<br><br>"I know it," I say. "I've known it for a long time. . . . All anybody has had to do for the past year or so was read the editorials in magazines like Life, or the Post, and they would've known the whole thing was falling apart." When sheets like that start predicting imminent apocalypse and monstrous social earthquakes, you know the keg's about to blow, because those mags are part of the Greater American Mainline at present, they shoot right out to reach in one way or another a majority of the populace every week, and the last thing they want to do is alarm Mr. and Mrs. America unnecessarily, to set the reactionaries to cleaning their '76 muskets or alarm the milk-and-sports-page millions securely ensconced in their stucco dugouts with unfounded rumors of indigenous explosions expected to rip out the quiet keep-off-the-grass parks, the shady cement sidewalks leaf strewn cross the illusions of permanence in the initials of lovers now friends walking precincts on Desenex feet and varicose veins for the Republican party and the Next President of the United States (as is obvious by today, since last night) Richard M. Nixon, no, these serene town centers proudly perpetuating quiet cracker images from 1853 must not be torn up madly out of that storied earth like the vertebrae of some ironically smiling Jesus of brilliantine halo, after all, this isn't France!<br><br>I said to Andy that I'd foreseen the seam-ripping of America's frayed old frock coat, and I added: "I supposed it couldn't be otherwise. . . ." and she said "Democracy won't work, it's a shame but it just won't work" and I said, "The reason it's falling apart this way is that the people of America have been living in the past too long. . . . For too long we've broadcasted the American Dream on all networks as gospel and everybody's been content . . . living in the past. . . . The nation is falling now because its people haven't been able to face it when the granite thunderbolt plows square into their upper plates, that the American Dream is only a dream, and that the American Reality is imperative, a powder-keg situation."<br><br>She started crying again. I put my hand on hers where it lay on the seat and she pulled it away abruptly, with the first touch. "Oh, don't try to comfort me, you, I know that you don't understand . . . it's the people like you . . . and that shit you read-"<br><br>"You mean the Free Press, and like that?"<br><br>"That crap, that filthy lying crap, and the crap those Right-Wingers put out, that's what's destroyed America!"<br><br>I won't deny it, for all I know she's pretty right, in fact I'm sure she is, those hysterical paranoid Left-er New Left idiots are just as much to blame as anybody. America, which is essentially our universe, is having earthquake-sized convulsions, choking, spitting up blood, reeling dizzily into some crumpling limp falldown of terminal disease, weaving back and forth on its knees moaning and clutching itself tightly in one wounded area after another, raving like a wood-grain-alcoholic crashing in the Bowery on his Last Go-Round, and I don't have any answers, or even very many opinions right now, seems like all the factions in the brawl are starting to look like the very thing they're opposing so desperately, so that even semilucid and halfway rational New Leftists who can see in reasonably complete clarity the disastrous turn their politics and political organizations down to the last one have taken, must still sit tight keep their chops gritted and be ready for the impending fight, no matter what the consequences, perhaps because they've never really conceived of America falling into a continent of burning junk piles and primitive local control by brute force, meaning that perhaps they're just bored with the same old scene, day after day, month after month, everything secure, bolted down, in order, safe for the cowering rodent-citizenry of elm-lined tract homes, maybe these cats just wanta see the entire structure fall or at least get shaken to its quick for once simply because it's never happened before and, you know, man, like with their Che caps and half-ass homemade Mollies, why, they're a Revolutionary Insurgent Liberation Army, can-you-dig-it?, ready to get out there by God and do some fucking Liberating! No matter if the cat's never seen blood in his life before outside the movies, man, he will fight with the strength of twenty flabby imperialist racist middle-class WASP head of human cattle because he has the pure true Fire in his heart, and not only that he's taken lots of acid!

She&#x2019;d been sitting under the yew tree on the edge of Auchengray&#x2019; s garden, cradling her infant son to her breast, brushing her fingers through his silky hair, singing softly as he nursed. <br><br><i>Baloo, baloo, my wee, wee thing.<br><br></i>Ian&#x2019;s warm scent seemed to permeate the air of her aunt&#x2019;s tiny cottage in Twyneholm. The recalled softness of his cheek felt more real than the linen nightgown beneath her fingertips, the memory of his small, hungry mouth more tangible than the rough sheets against her bare skin.<br><br>She gripped the edges of the bed as grief pierced her heart anew. Aunt Meg had insisted the pain would ease with time. Leana glanced over her shoulder at the older woman, still fast asleep. Her aunt meant well, but two months had not diminished the potent memories of her son that haunted her dreams and clouded her thoughts. <br><br>By the hour she&#x2019;d contemplated going home to Auchengray. Only two dozen miles, yet &#x201c;a world away,&#x201d; as Aunt Meg had once said. Leana had pictured herself running up the stair to the nursery, gathering Ian in her arms, and holding him for days on end. She would have done it. She <i>would</i> have. If somehow she could have seen Ian yet not seen Jamie.<br><br><i>Oh, my dear Jamie. <br><br></i>Aye, she missed him as well, desperately so. In a different way, yet the same. <i>Bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.</i> The smooth planes of his face, the dark slash of his brows, his generous mouth and strong chin rose before her like a portrait painted by a master artist. She had loved Jamie McKie from the first moment he walked across Auchengray&#x2019;s lawn one bright October afternoon. Though it was more than a year before he returned that love, when he did, Jamie had given her his whole heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>But now that heart belonged to her sister. To Rose. <br><br>Leana turned her head on the pillow, imagining Jamie beside her. Did he love her still, as she loved him? Did he think of her at all? Did he suffer as she did? She was ashamed of her thoughts, but they would not be silenced.<br><br>This much she knew: No letter had arrived begging her to return. No carriage or mount had come clattering up to Burnside&#x2019;s door, prepared to carry her home. She had left Auchengray of her own free will on the day of Rose&#x2019;s wedding, intending to stay at Aunt Meg&#x2019; s long enough to mend her shattered heart. And long enough for Rose to mend Jamie&#x2019; s, as much as it grieved Leana to think of it. <br><br>It was nearly June. With the spring lambing ended at Auchengray, surely they&#x2019;d left for Jamie&#x2019;s ancestral home in the glen of Loch Trool, taking her precious Ian with them. &#x201c;We will wipe the dust of Auchen-gray off our feet come May,&#x201d; Jamie had promised her in February. Instead, it was Rose who&#x2019;d traveled to Glentrool.<br><br>Would her sister write once they settled in? Describe how Ian was growing? Declare he looked more like his father every day? Though such news might wound her, Leana preferred it to no word at all. Not a single post bearing Rose&#x2019;s <i>kenspeckle</i> script had arrived at Burnside Cottage. Nor was there one from her father. But thoughtful Neda Has-tings, Auchengray&#x2019;s housekeeper, had sent a long letter last month, brimming with details of Ian&#x2019;s progress. <br><br>There was no mention of Jamie. The man who was once her husband. The man who&#x2019;d blessed her womb with Ian. The man now married to her sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Be thou my strong rock,&#x201d; Leana whispered into the darkness. Drawing the Almighty&#x2019;s comforting presence round her like a thick plaid, she rose from the <i>hurlie</i> bed. Meg had trundled it out from beneath her own bed the March night her niece had arrived. Low to the floor and narrow, it was much like the one Leana had slept in at home in the nursery. With Ian.<br><br>Her gaze fell on the small nightgown draped over her sewing bag. She&#x2019;d pieced it together from remnants of soft cotton, intending to embroider the sleeves and hem with purple thistles. By the time she completed it, Ian would be nine months old and in need of a new sleeping gown. If she could not see him, she could at least sew for him. Holding the fabric in her hands brought him closer to her. Imagining her stitches brushing against his tender skin gave her a small measure of comfort. <br><br>While her aunt snored soundly, Leana bathed her hands and face in a warm bowl by the hearth. She slipped on her plain green gown, then swung a kettle over the coal grate to boil water for their tea, ever aware that her days in Twyneholm were numbered. Her aunt could ill afford a houseguest much longer. And Leana missed home.<br><br>She lit one of the beeswax candles made from Meg&#x2019;s own hives, then collected the tools for her baking&#x2013;a wooden <i>spurtle</i> for stirring, a notched rolling pin, and a heart-shaped iron spade to move the oatcakes about&#x2013;recalling the many times she and Neda had worked side by side in Auchengray&#x2019;s spacious kitchen.<br><br>A handful of meal, a pinch of soda, a dash of salt, a spoonful of goose fat from last night&#x2019;s supper, and the first oatcake took shape beneath her hands. She sprinkled the board with meal as she went, added hot water sparingly, and kneaded the small lump of dough with her knuckles. Neda&#x2019; s voice echoed in her head. <i>Spread it </i>oot<i> evenly.</i> <i>Keep yer hands movin&#x2019;.</i> Leana rolled the dough as thin as she could and pinched the edges with her fingers before the first oatcake went onto the <i>girdle</i> over the fire, and the process started all over again. <br><br>A faint light spread across the room as she worked. Soon a cock&#x2019;s crow from a neighboring farm announced the break of day.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve ne&#x2019;er seen a finer pair of hands at a baking board.&#x201d; <br><br>She looked up to find Margaret Halliday beaming at her from across the room, a threadbare wrapper tied round her waist. Leana managed a wan smile in return. &#x201c;Good morning, Auntie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll spoil me yet, lass. Preparing my breakfast for me. Weeding my kitchen garden. Filling my coal pail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis the least I can do.&#x201d; Leana kept an eye on the oatcakes. When the edges curled up, they were done. &#x201c;My hands are full of meal, or I&#x2019;d pour your tea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Och</i>. I&#x2019;ll see to that.&#x201d; <br><br>The women moved round to accommodate each other in the small cooking space and soon were seated at table, their breakfast on a crockery plate. Leana nibbled a piece of oatcake but put it down half-eaten, her appetite vanished.<br><br>Aunt Meg reached across the table and turned Leana&#x2019;s chin toward the window, eying her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve grown thinner since you came. This morn in particular, you&#x2019;ve a <i>dwiny</i> look about you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My stomach does feel a bit queasy.&#x201d; Leana swallowed the disagreeable taste in her mouth, then pressed a hand to her forehead. &#x201c;But my skin is cool.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve not had an epidemic in the parish for nigh to thirty years. Ague, it was. Terrible fevers and chills.&#x201d; Aunt Meg peered at her more closely. &#x201c;Did my roasted goose not sit well on your stomach? I thought it a pleasant change from mutton and fish.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ate too much of it, I fear. I&#x2019;ll go for a walk shortly, which should help.&#x201d; She stared down at her teacup as if the dark liquid contained the strength she needed to say what must be said. &#x201c;Auntie, it&#x2019;s time I went home to Auchengray.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, my dear niece.&#x201d; The disappointment in Meg&#x2019;s voice was obvious. <br><br>Leana looked up and touched her aunt&#x2019;s wrinkled cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve stayed far too long already. Nearly two months.&#x201d;<br><br>Meg&#x2019;s eyes watered. &#x201c;When you came to my door that rainy Sabbath eve, I was happy to make room for you. And I&#x2019;d gladly share Burnside Cottage with you for all of my days, if you wouldn&#x2019;t mind an <i>auld</i> woman&#x2019;s company.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You are far from old, and I cherish your company.&#x201d; Leana tenderly brushed away Meg&#x2019;s tears. &#x201c;But you cannot afford to feed and clothe me. And I have duties to attend to at home. With Rose gone, Auchengray has no mistress. The gardens will suffer, and the wool won&#x2019;t be spun.&#x201d; She squeezed Meg&#x2019;s bony hands. &#x201c;Do forgive me, dearie. You knew this time would come.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, though I hoped it might not.&#x201d; Her aunt regarded her at length, compassion shining in her blue gray eyes. &#x201c;Will you write Willie and ask him to bring the chaise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nae,&#x201d; Leana said firmly. She could not involve Willie, Auchengray&#x2019;s <i>orraman</i>, without her father&#x2019;s permission. Not again. &#x201c;This must be my own doing. My own silver. A hired chaise.&#x201d;<br><br>Her aunt&#x2019;s mouth fell open. &#x201c;But you have no silver.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A predicament I shall remedy shortly.&#x201d; Leana tried to sound confident, though she had yet to think of a means of securing such a sum. &#x201c;Mr. Crosbie at the tollgate said a chaise and driver would cost me fifteen shillings.&#x201d; A fortune for a woman with mere pennies in her purse.<br><br>Meg propped her chin on her hand. &#x201c;Would that I had the silver to give you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done more than enough, Auntie. Suppose I go for that walk and see if some clever notion doesn&#x2019;t present itself.&#x201d; Leana stood, feeling lightheaded for a moment, then slipped on her cloak and prayed the brisk morning air would calm her stomach. One of her aunt&#x2019;s two collies bounded through the doorway ahead of her and shook itself awake from ears to tail, then turned round, waiting for her to follow.<br><br>Leana pulled Burnside&#x2019; s red wooden door closed, then absently scratched the dog&#x2019;s silky head. Twyneholm was not a proper village, merely a cluster of two-room cottages&#x2013;some with thatched roofs, like Meg&#x2019;s, others with slate&#x2013;built along the military road. Reverend Scott, the parish minister, insisted that a great and ancient battle, fought nigh to the kirk, had left a king slain and his vanquished men staggering home in a winding direction&#x2013;hence the name<i> tae wyne hame</i>. Aunt Meg scoffed at his romantic notion. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis a low patch of land, or holm, that lies &#x2019;tween the Tarff Water and the Corraford Burn.&#x201d; <br><br>Leana only knew that Twyneholm had served her well. A quiet refuge for a heart torn in two. In a handful of days, when the month of June arrived, she would look to the north, to Auchengray, and pray for the means&#x2013;and the strength&#x2013;to return home. <br><br>She no longer had a child to mother or a husband to love. But she did have faith in the One who had not forsaken her. <i>I will never leave you.</i> Words the Almighty had spoken to Jamie in a dream. Words she had whispered to Jamie when their future was certain. Words Leana still held close to her heart.</p><h2>COLLECTED POEMS OF SCHUYLER</h2><p><p>This collection of poetry showcases the unique talent of James Schuyler and highlights the writing that won him a Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>"Schuyler's subject is his life, and his poems often read like elegant journal entries." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p>Born in Chicago in 1923, the late James Schuyler gravitated early on to Manhattan, where he came to be associated with such stalwarts of the New York School as Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, and John Ashbery. Yet his work--unlike, say, Ashbery's, with whom he wrote a novel, <i>A Nest of Ninnies</i>--is eminently accessible. Indeed, Schuyler's <i>Collected Poems</i> functions as an exquisite illustration of how to write poetry with a crystal-clear surface. And he always remains a master of the light touch, even when he himself is in desperate straits. <p> In Schuyler's long pieces, such as "Hymn to Life," "The Morning of the Poem," and "A Few Days," he casually reverses the romantic position: anti-didactic, anti-epiphanic, he trusts his imagination and resists any psychological theorizing about why one memory, one perception, is connected to another. He mistrusts monumentality. Wisdom, he knows, is enervating: "Things should get better as you / grow older, but that / is not the way. The way is inscrutable and hard to / handle." But long or short, <i>Collected Poems</i> is a record of discoveries, and each one is marked by Schuyler's terrific antennae and gift of tonal rightness. (The same qualities are on ample, if more casual, display in the poet's diary.) There's no question that he is among the most formidable and most <i>observant</i> poets of postwar America. Indeed, his attractively quotidian elegy for W.H. Auden is a far more subtle poem than the endlessly quoted tour de force that Auden dedicated to W.B. Yeats: </p><blockquote> I don't have to burn his<br> letters as he asked his<br> friends to do: they were lost<br> a long time ago. So much<br> to remember, so little to<br> say: that he liked martinis<br> and was greedy about the wine?<br> I always thought he would live<br> to a great age. He did not.<br> Wystan, kind man and great poet,<br> goodbye.<br> </blockquote> Nobody thought that James Schuyler would live to a great age. But the death of this "kind man and great poet" in 1991 felt no less cruelly premature. <i>--Mark Rudman</i><p><b>James Schuyler </b>(1923&#x2013;91) received the Pulitzer Prize for poetry for <i>The Morning of the Poem </i>in 1981.</p></p><h2>The Villa</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Nora Roberts exposes a proud family&#x2019;s deadly secrets in this passionate tale of two Napa Valley rivals...</b><br><br>PR executive Sophia Giambelli loves her job and has never worried about competition.

And when acts of sabotage threaten both the family business and the family itself, Sophia&#x2019;s quest will be not only for dominance, but also for survival.</p><p>Set in beautiful Napa Valley, California, Nora Roberts's latest novel portrays a rich world of family-owned wineries, complete with enough romance, sophisticated business intrigue, betrayal, and murder to cow the Medicis of Florence. <i>The Villa</i> focuses on the merger of two prominent winemaking families, the Giambellis and MacMillans, and the incendiary combination of the two upcoming leaders of those dynasties, Sophia Giambelli and Tyler MacMillan. Tyler is the manager of the MacMillan vines and the distilling process, a job that suits his frank and no-frills personality. Creative and flashy, Sophia is head of Giambelli's public relations, and her job has been to put the best spin on whatever her family business produces--hard to do when the merger requires that she and Tyler switch jobs, and particularly hard to do when her own heart seems to spin out of control whenever they're together.<p> Soon after the merger goes through, Tyler and Sophia learn that they have bigger problems than their conflicting work styles. Tony Avano, a Giambelli executive and Sophia's father, is murdered, and threats surface against the Giambelli women. As a quiet woman, Sophia's mother, Pilar, has made few enemies, except for Tony's new wife, Rene. The matriarch of the family--known simply as La Signora--may have knocked some rivals aside as she clawed her way to the top, but few would have reason to threaten her now. When poison is discovered in Giambelli wine, Sophia and Tyler learn the killer is much closer than they thought.</p><p> In description, dialogue, and plot, Roberts's talent and control are as fine as ever. But while the relationship between Pilar and David, the new COO, feels complex and mature, Sophia and Tyler's romance can at times feel slightly forced. As Roberts explains repeatedly, Sophia approaches sex "as a man does," which apparently means with no strings attached. And while that does tend to take the "romance" out of the romance to some extent, the positive aspects to be found in <i>The Villa</i> outweigh this flaw, ensuring another hit for the talented and prolific Roberts. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>Sophia Giambelli has never had to worry about competition.

Should it produce workers or educate future citizens? Is there a place for faith schools - and should patriotism be taught? </p> <p>In this compelling and controversial book, Harry Brighouse takes on all these urgent questions and more. He argues that children share four fundamental interests: the ability to make their own judgements about what values to adopt; acquiring the skills that will enable them to become economically self-sufficient as adults; being exposed to a range of activities and experiences that will enable them to flourish in their personal lives; and developing a sense of justice. </p> <p>He criticises sharply those who place the interests of the economy before those of children, and assesses the arguments for and against the controversial issues of faith schools and the teaching of patriotism.</p> <p>Clearly argued but provocative, <em>On Education</em> draws on recent examples from Britain and North America as well as famous thinkers on education such as Aristotle and John Locke.

In the past it was combined with other natural dyes to create a range of colours that are impossible to reproduce without synthetic substitutes (a recent phenomenon). In todays multi-coloured world, it is hard to imagine the incredible impact indigo must have had on the many civilizations that chanced upon it. The accumulation of more than 15 years research, this is the first book to cover in detail all aspects of this subject: historical, agricultural, and botanical chemical and technological; commercial and economic; and, indigos various uses in textiles and its many sociological, medicinal, folkloric and other connotations.</p><p><p> Jenny Balfour-Paul, an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Exeter and a Fellow of both the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club, is a partner in "Silk Road Connect", an exciting educational initiative of Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project. She is also a Councillor and Trustee of the Royal Geographical Society and President of the UK Association of Guilds of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers. A renowned authority on indigo, Jenny has been publishing, lecturing, exhibiting and broadcasting on dye and related subjects for well over twenty years. </p>(review of UK edition) (reviewed with Madder Red) Both books combine practical wisdom with a tireless search for historical evidence in print, documents, textiles and photographs, and both deal with the use of the dyes in textiles, paints, and medicines, though their emphases differ.

(Joan Thirsk, emeritus reader in economic history, <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2001-02-01)<br><br>(review of UK edition) Indigo: Egyptian Mummies to Blue Jeans is the definitive work on the dye, tracing its exotic history from the times of the ancient Pharaohs to the present day. Indigo, first published in 1998 by The British Museum Press, has a recently updated last chapter that focuses on sustainability and the environment in the 21st century, and looks at how the dye is once again growing in popularity thanks to an increased demand for organic clothing made from eco-friendly materials. It is far more relevant today because synthetic dyes made from toxic ingredients and used by the textile and fashion industries are creating a large amount waste that is polluting the planet. Natural indigo is made from plants and is a non-toxic product that enriches the soil. In hotter climates indigo can be farmed in rotation with other crops, or on waste land, and it also provides employment in rural regions. Currently, one of Jenny Balfour-Paul's projects is to encourage worldwide revivals<br> of sustainable natural dyes. The book is beautifully illustrated with over 435 images that show how the dye has featured in different cultures and communities throughout the world. Jenny's experience as a batik artist and teacher is evident in her exploration of how indigo has been portrayed in folklore and through art, exemplified by some stunning photographs of textiles. Indigo has been the symbol for a diverse range of beliefs, highly prized in some cultures, for thousands of years. Strongly associated with wealth, fertility, rites of passage and even in mourning ceremonies, indigo has always been a desirable commodity. Nothing is left out that anyone with an interest in the development of indigo could possibly want to know, from the agricultural and botanical origins to the commerce and economics of the dye. (Jo Wyndham Ward <i>Jo Wyndham Ward Blog</i> 2011-10-25)<br><br>Capturing a tapestry of cultural importance around the world author Jenny Balfour-Paul has dedicated most of her life to researching the history of the indigo dye, and gives an in depth explanation of why it's so important now. Following the oldest dye in the world really makes you understand how powerful this dye was for royalty and for trading throughout the ages right up to modern day. If you're interested in the production of dyeing or you're in an art program at school this is a book you want to have for your archives. For denim lovers (the denim industry is the largest user of indigo dye) and design enthusiasts, the book will offer new insight into the process of dyeing denim and fabric.

Two-hundred-and-eighteen exercises encourage readers to formulate their own ideas about the behavior of a physical system, correct any misconceptions they may have, and build a better conceptual foundation of physics. <b> </b> Covering as many topic domains in physics as possible, the book contains Kinematics Ranking Tasks, Force Ranking Tasks, Projectile and Other Two-Dimensional Motion Ranking Tasks, Work-Energy Ranking Tasks, Impulse-Momentum Ranking Tasks, Rotation Ranking Tasks, SHM and Properties of Matter Ranking Tasks, Heat and Thermodynamics Ranking Tasks, Electrostatics Ranking Tasks, DC Circuit Ranking Tasks, Magnetism and Electromagnetism Ranking Tasks, and Wave and Optics Ranking Tasks. <b> </b> For anyone who wants a better conceptual understanding of the many areas of physics. </p></p><p><p> This student text contains 218 Ranking Task Exercises that cover all classical physics topics. Ranking Tasks are an innovative type of conceptual exercise that asks students to make comparative judgments about a set of variations on a particular physical situation. These exercises were developed by participants in the Two-Year College (TYC) Physics Workshop Project sponsored by Joliet Junior College, Lee College, and a series of grants from the Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation, and were edited by Thomas L. O'Kuma (Lee College), David P. Maloney (Indiana University-Purdue University, Fort Wayne), and Curtis J. Hieggelke (Joliet Junior College). </p> <p> Those who have used Ranking Tasks have found that they frequently elicit students' natural ideas, rather than a memorized response, about the behavior of a given physical system. In addition, asking students to consider the same situation in a variety of ways often helps them begin to correct any misconceptions they may have. When students realize that they have given different answers to variations of the same question, they begin to think about why they responded as they did in each case. This, in turn, prompts them to consider which responses they believe in more strongly, and why. </p> <b>The basic structure of a Ranking Task comprises four elements:</b> <ul> <li>a description of the physical situation, including any constraints and the basis for ranking different arrangements</li> <li>a set of figures showing the different arrangements of the situation to be compared</li> <li>a place to record the ranking of each variation</li> <li>a place to explain the reason for each ranking choice</li> </ul> <p> Prentice Hall is proud to publish this book as part of its Series in Educational Innovation. </p><p> This workbook is designed to be a resource for students to deepen their understanding of physic. Students need to get beyond the "memorize and recall" approach and this workbook will be useful for that purpose. The tasks in this manual ask the user to apply the ideas that are being learned in a new way. Using the ideas in different ways will get the user to think about those ideas in more breadth and depth, leading to a stronger understanding. </p> <p> The tasks in this manual grew out of investigations into students thinking about physics as they were learning the subject. These tasks are likely to be quite different from the tasks you have encountered in other math and science courses. They are different in several ways. First, comparing several similar situations to each other, rather than finding a particular value associated with a situation, is likely to be new. This novelty may make doing ranking tasks uncomfortable since you may feel insecure about how to determine such comparisons. Practice will make this reaction fade. </p> <p> A second way these tasks differ from more familiar ones is that a number of these tasks will contain irrelevant information. Since you are probably used to problems where all information provided needs to be used, the job of having to determine whether, and what, information may be irrelevant may be challenging until you get used to it. But you should be aware that problems in real life very often require determining what information is needed and what information can be ignored. Since that is the case it is worthwhile to have some practice with such problems in academic settings also. </p> <p> Another difference is that these tasks ask you to determine and write a ranking, then explain the reasoning/work behind your ranking sequence, and finally indicate a confidence level for your work. It is important to explicitly write out your explanations, even when you are doing the items for yourself, because you will often find that your thinking will change and improve when you try to explain what you did and why you did it. </p> <p> A fourth difference is that there are groups of related tasks throughout the workbook. The tasks in these groupings can be related in a number of ways. For example, the situations in two tasks may be exactly the same, but the basis for the ranking may be different. Thinking about the similarities and differences among tasks in such groupings can provide very useful insights into the physics of the situations. </p> <p> This workbook is designed to be useful for students in all introductory-level physics courses, so some of the tasks included may involve ideas, and/or mathematics, specific to other courses. Please do not be concerned if some of the tasks seem not related to your course or background. </p> <p> Since the format for the ranking tasks in this workbook is most likely unfamiliar to you, you would be well advised to spend a little time getting used to the format itself before trying to deal with these tasks. To aid in the familiarization process we have 15rovided several example tasks showing how to complete the tasks correctly. We do strongly encourage you to read and study these introductory materials so that you feel comfortable with the structure and response process for ranking tasks before you start these physics ranking tasks. </p> <p> When you approach a ranking task you should not try to think of some equation that uses the quantities given and then plug the values in to find the "answers." As mentioned above, many of the ranking tasks contain irrelevant information, in some cases all of the numerical values provided are irrelevant. So if you automatically take a "plug and chug" approach to the ranking tasks you will find that you are often going to be doing calculations for nothing. The best way to tackle a ranking task is to think about how you expect the object/system in the physical situation to behave. Then use the given information to determine the specific comparisons among the given variations. </p></p><h2>An Environmental History of Latin America (New Approaches to the Americas)</h2><p>This book narrates the mutually mortal historical contest between humans and nature in Latin America.

Those days, I was sleeping better than ever. It was more like my body knew: This is the moment, Chris. Ten years, four months in the making. Let's get it done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You ready, Wilson?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm ready."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They walked me down the tier, everyone asleep at this hour, nothing but the sound of our shoes on the concrete floor, the doors buzzing as the guards pushed them open, then clanging shut as we left. They put the cuffs on to process me through the last gate, the guard whispering "Good luck, Wilson, we're rooting for you" as he locked the chain around my waist. When he stepped away, he was all business as usual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The transfer bus took almost an hour: ten minutes through the rolling fields of Howard County; thirty on the interstate; another fifteen through the Washington, DC, suburbs of Prince George's County to the courthouse in Upper Marlboro, where my original trial had taken place. It was still dark, so there wasn't much to see past my own reflection looking back at me through the bars across the bus window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the basement of the courthouse: another set of doors and metal detectors, another set of procedures. They locked me in a holding cell with five members of the MS-13 street gang-skinny Salvadorans with tattoos on their faces, because MS-13 is no joke; the members are dedicated to the life. I wasn't chained, but I was in my prison uniform. I never wore it, because I wanted to look on the outside like the man I was inside, but it was required here. This was who the system said I was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Salvadorans watched me with suspicion as I slid onto the bench. I nodded, but nobody nodded back. Eventually, they started arguing in Spanish about whether I was a snitch, put in the cell to eavesdrop and gather information. They were in for a preliminary hearing, but the state had nothing, they said, so don't say nothing, especially around this sopl&#x2014;n. I spoke fluent Spanish-I spoke three languages fluently, in fact, and I was working on Mandarin-but I didn't react. I didn't want to spook them. We were in the cell for almost two hours, and for the last hour nobody said a word.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Inmate 265-975. Inmate Wilson. Let's go, Wilson."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No soy un sopl&#x2014;n," I said as I left. Just so they knew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rode up in the elevator with a black female bailiff. She was a grandmotherly type, her hair set, uniform pressed. She smelled nice. Nothing in prison smelled nice. "You have a good judge," she said. "She's a fair lady. What's your sentence?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Life."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh," she said as her face dropped. For lifers, she knew, there was never good news. "Well, good luck."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Serrette was on her high seat, studying me as I entered. How many men like me has she seen today? I wondered. How many this week? This month? The jury box was empty, but the public benches were packed with bored people, mostly women and children, mostly black, waiting for their loved ones to be called. I searched the crowd, but nobody looked back. All these friends and family were here for other prisoners. I knew nobody was coming for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The only person there for me-my pro bono lawyer, Keith Showstack-was laughing and joking with the state's attorney. I had known Keith for more than seven years. I trusted him with my life. But when I saw him laughing with the state's attorney, it threw me, the old street mistrust coming back. She's trying to keep me inside forever. Why you talking to her?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keith put his hand on my shoulder. He winked, like, We got this, Chris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He looked confident, but Keith Showstack always looked confident. He looked confident the day I met him, in the lawyer's room at the Patuxent Institution, when I was a twenty-year-old lifer and he was a twenty-three-year-old family law intern with slicked-back hair and a South Boston accent so thick I could barely understand him. It took us six years and five rejections by the judge to get this sentence modification hearing-the only way a lifer like me could get out from under-but every three months Keith had slapped his ratty briefcase on the table at Patuxent, smiled like he knew every secret in the book, and said, "They turned down your request again, Chris. But don't worry."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Easy for you to say, when you get to drive home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Your Honor, we're prepared," he said, "if the court is ready."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The state's attorney hammered my crime, like I knew she would. A man was shot six times, Your Honor, she said. Shot in the middle of the chest. Shot in the lower right side of the chest. Shot in the right buttocks. In the right elbow. Shot in the hand, Your Honor, as he was running. Murdered, Your Honor, while running away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He will never be able to better himself," she said. "He will never be able to say I'm proud of myself, I got an associate's degree. He will never know his children. He will never know his grandchildren. He was shot down at thirty-one years of age. That defendant"-pointing at me-"without any thought to what his life was like, took it away."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The state's attorney sat down, and I could feel the spectators on their benches leaning forward, because this was more than a crime, it was a murder, and I was more than a prisoner. I had been sentenced to natural life in the penitentiary system of the state of Maryland at the age of seventeen, and I had only one shot, this shot, of ever walking out of my cell alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So everyone in that courtroom wanted to know what I had to say. Was I innocent? Was I falsely accused? Were there extenuating circumstances, like self-defense? The judge turned to me, like, Well? Not unkind, but curious. I hoped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I took a deep breath. This was it. My life in a moment. My fate in a stranger's hands. My last chance, or I would die in a prison cell thirty, forty, fifty years in the future, an old man slurping watery farina from a plastic bowl. And yet I felt calm. I knew what I had to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Your Honor," I said. "I want to tell you the truth."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>part 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Cave</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How could they see anything but the shadows</p><p>if they were never allowed to move their heads?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-Plato, "The Allegory of the Cave"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Division Avenue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My grandparents, Grandma and Big Daddy, moved to Northeast Washington, DC, in 1948, when it was the black part of town. They bought a duplex and raised five children there, the youngest being my mom, who everybody called Mona after the Mona Lisa. That's what Big Daddy wanted to name her, Mona Lisa, but Grandma said you couldn't burden a child with a name like that. Grandma was always practical. So they named my mom Charlene, but ended up calling her Mona Lisa anyway, since Big Daddy refused to call her anything else. One way or the other, Big Daddy got his way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hear the neighborhood was nice back in the day. Big Daddy worked as a clerk in various government offices and drove a Capitol Cab. He made decent money, and I suspect most of the people in the neighborhood did, too, although it was segregation money, and there was only so much that ordinary black people could make. Working poor, but proud. Grandma stayed home with the children, and she worked hard, too. She had flowers along the street and a garden full of southern specialties like collard greens-Grandma was from a small town in North Carolina, Big Daddy from an even smaller town in Mississippi-and she kept the house spotless. Most of her children went on to successful lives, although Uncle Buddy still alternates between her basement and the street, and we lost Uncle Gerald to AIDS, which he caught from heroin needles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even when my sister and I were living with them in the 1980s, Grandma kept things square. Three home-cooked meals, chores after school. Wash your hands when you walk in the door and don't talk back. Church on Wednesday evening, no excuses. Big Daddy had his recliner and his television shows, and you didn't want to disturb his routine by forcing him to punish you, because he was a large and serious man. It was better to sit with him and watch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Outside, though, the neighborhood was rough. The working black community had been transformed by housing projects, especially the 440-unit Lincoln Heights Houses. Fifteen depressing three-story cinder-block and brick buildings surrounded by dirt yards, the Houses threw a shadow over the neighborhood from the hill right behind Grandma's house. Three blocks away, next to the elementary school, was Clay Terrace, another 1960s-era government housing project. The Lincoln Heights crews and the Clay Terrace crews hated one another and were always beefing. My grandparents' duplex, with its tidy flowers and neatly trimmed plot of grass, was right in the middle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was fine during the day. There were kids on the block, and we played in the street. Heroin addicts wandered up from the bottom of the hill a few blocks away-heroin was the drug back then, and the block known as "the bottom" was where to buy it-but mostly it was kids playing chase, old heads on porches, nosy women hanging out of windows, and Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick blasting all day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But when the streetlights came on, the crews came out. Mostly I remember arguments, yelling that turned into fights and sometimes brawls. Car alarms going off, windows smashed. Guys tore bricks out of the border around Grandma's garden and used them as weapons, and Grandma went out the next morning, on her knees, and put them back in place. Back then, if it was gunshots, it was only three or four.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just keep your head down and your eyes to yourself," Grandma said as she ferociously brushed my hair before sending my sister and me off to school. "Don't talk to nobody and you won't have problems. God don't like the ugly."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was three blocks to Richardson Elementary, with three ways to get there. I planned my route every day. It wasn't the dealers I wanted to avoid; it was the middle-school girls. They chased us, taunted us, and forced us to kiss them. I loved girls, even at seven years old. Most days I spent my lunch money on candy from the corner store to share with cute classmates. Those teenage girls, though, were terrifying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was never a good student. Too much anxiety. Even as a first grader, I stayed awake most nights, worrying about the yelling, the gunshots, the car tires squealing away. More than any other sound from my youth, that's what I remember: car tires squealing away. But I was smart. I read books. I joined the chess club. I was chosen for school trips to Baltimore and New York, where I toured the United Nations and saw the Statue of Liberty. I was even our class representative to CEO for a Day. We spent a few hours at a Safeway, learning how they ran a grocery store. It wasn't a CEO position, and it smelled like cabbage, but I guess they figured that this was the best kids from Lincoln Heights could hope for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can't remember how I discovered the Capitol View Library. It was nine blocks away, probably the farthest I had ever walked from my grandparents' duplex. Grandma scolded me when she found out I was crossing East Capitol Street, because it was a four-lane. She thought it wasn't safe, which is funny, because she insisted the neighborhood was fine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's good here," she said, even when a teenager got shot on our block. "Just keep your eyes to yourself and pray. God don't like the ugly."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The library was where I got away from the tension of the street. It had a kids' room where the librarians read books. I remember a librarian telling us about the great library in Alexandria, Egypt, and how scholars came from all over the world to study there, and how boat captains stopped to have the librarians draw them maps before they headed out on long voyages. I thought, Wow. There been libraries for two thousand years. I pictured it like a tower, a thousand stories tall. I didn't know, until much later, the library in Alexandria burned down. I guess everything, eventually, burns down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was around then I started noticing the bullet casings and baggies-crack didn't come in vials in my area. The next minute, it seemed, I started seeing young men in nice cars and guys on porches, in broad daylight, putting coolers on the barrels of their guns and loading extended clips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They'd catch me watching and nod. "That's an Uzi, young," they'd say, showing off. "You like it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My sister, Leslie, who was a year older and protective, talked me onto the school track team. I was the smallest kid in third grade and I had asthma, but Coach Perguson took no pity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Every kid thinks they have asthma, Chris," he said, walking around in his skintight tracksuit. "You don't have asthma. You're just out of shape."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even when I was sick and huffing, barely able to breathe, Coach Perguson challenged me. "You wanna quit, Chris?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You can quit running right now, Chris, but if you do, you better start walking, because you're off the team. I got no room for quitters. I'm looking for warriors!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And just when my lungs were burning, and I felt like dying, my sister would run up beside me and whisper, "Don't quit, Chris. Keep going."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a fence separating the field from the Clay Terraces, and men would get up against it, drinking from bottles and laughing at us. We saw drug deals going down. One time, a stolen car being chased by the cops slammed through the fence and went skidding across the field in the middle of practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Keep running! Push it!" Coach Perguson yelled like he never even noticed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I liked track-I liked being challenged. My passion, though, was books, especially after I discovered a section of child-friendly versions of classics like Aesop's Fables and the Greek myths. I checked them out, curled up in a sheet on the floor of my bedroom, and read until late at night. I had a bed, but I never slept in it. I was too worried about stray bullets coming in the window. Since the arrival of the Uzis and Mac-11s, it felt like stray bullets were always coming through windows on Division Avenue.</p></p><h2>LAtitudes: An Angeleno&#39;s Atlas</h2><p>This literary and cartographic exploration of Los Angeles reorients our understanding of the city in highly imaginative ways. Illuminated by boldly conceived and artfully rendered maps and infographics, nineteen essays by LA's most exciting writers reveal complex histories and perspectives of a place notorious for superficiality. This chorus of voices explores wildly different subjects: Cindi Alvitre unveils the indigenous Tongva presence of the Los Angeles Basin; Michael Jaime-Becerra takes us into the smoky, spicy kitchens of a family taquero business in El Monte; Steve Graves traces the cowboy-and-spacemen-themed landscapes of the San Fernando Valley. Overlooked sites and phenomena become apparent: LGBT churches and synagogues, a fabled &#x201c;Cycleway,&#x201d; mustachioed golden carp, urban forests, lost buildings, ugly buildings. What has been ignored, such as environmental and social injustice, is addressed with powerful anger and elegiac sadness, and what has been maligned is reexamined with a sense of pride: the city's freeways, for example, take the shape of a dove when viewed from midair and pulsate with wailing blues, surf rock, and brassy banda.<p>Inspired by other texts that combine literature and landscape, including Rebecca Solnit's <i>Infinite City</i>, this book's juxtapositions make surprising connections and stir up undercurrents of truth. To all those who inhabit, love, or seek to understand Los Angeles, <i>LAtitudes</i> gives meaning and reward.</p></p><p>Patricia Wakida's published books, essays, stories, and poetry include: <i>Only What We Could Carry: The Japanese American Internment Experience, Generations Experience; A Japanese American Community Portrait, Letters of Intent,</i> the <i>San Francisco Bay Guardian, Nikkei Heritage, Kyoto Journal, Santa Barbara Review</i>, and the <i>International Quarterly</i>.&#x201c;In consciously directing readers down a series of proverbial paths less taken, <i>LAtitudes</i> belies that laziest of stereotypes of Los Angeles as a homogenous, undifferentiated mass. As the book makes clear, the city is both palimpsest and jigsaw puzzle, all layers and fragments.&#x201d; --Oliver Wang, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><p>&#x201c;Written by an eclectic group of wits and scholars, this colorful and beautifully designed volume can be read again and again.&#x201d; --Jill Stewart, <i>LA Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;When I created my atlas of San Francisco, I was hoping that we were at the dawn of a new era of inventive, subversive, gorgeous mapping and social geographies. Let a thousand atlases bloom, I kept muttering, and I couldn't be more pleased that the first horse out of the gate first tiger lily in the flowerbed? is of the city of angels and overpasses and pastrami and tacos, of forgotten rivers, wars, refugees, voters, homesteaders, of dreams busy biting the dust and tribes miraculously reappearing. Cities are inexhaustible; they exist in countless versions, depending on who you ask and where you go and what you want; and an atlas like <i>LAtitudes</i> invites you to open up other people's versions and in so doing find your own.&#x201d; --Rebecca Solnit, author of <i>Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas</i> and <i>Unfathomable City: A New Orleans Atlas</i><br><br>&#x201c;Unique, fascinating, and totally fresh....Oh, yes, and <i>LAtitudes</i> has plenty of attitude.

After reading <i>LAtitudes</i>, however, I returned to Los Angeles this year with a newfound respect for the hopeful attempts, negotiations, complications, and mistakes that have made the city what it is today: a composite urban behemoth of bewildering beauty. The only thing more enticing than the quality of the prose in this book is the depth of the ideas contained therein.&#x201d; --Bradley L. Garrett, author of <i>Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City</i></p><p>&#x201c;A humane and beautifully written biography of the city that is also a lyrical exploration of its many layers...a source of inspiration and surprise for those of us who think we know LA as well those who have only imagined it from afar.&#x201d; --Alastair Bonnett, author of <i>Unruly Places: Lost Spaces, Secret Cities, and Other Inscrutable Geographies</i></p><p>&#x201c;Here we have a volume that, through stories of LA's history, tells stories of our present and foretells our future.

Griffin continues his gripping Men at War series, featuring the legendary OSS. <br><br> As the Battle of the Atlantic rages, German U-boats are sinking U.S. vessels at will. Meanwhile, preparations are being made to invade Sicily and Italy. As the war heats up, "Wild Bill" Donovan and his secret agents find themselves battling on two fronts at once. And fate is about to deal them a surprise that may doom them all.</p><p><b>W. E. B.

Butterworth IV&nbsp;</b>has been a writer and editor for major newspapers and magazines for more than twenty-five years, and has worked closely with his father for several years on the editing of the Griffin books. He is the coauthor of several novels in the Badge of Honor, Men at War, Honor Bound, and Presidential Agent series. He lives in St. Petersburg, Florida.David Colacci is certainly more than "a reader." He truly performs this WWII-era thriller with a twist: German saboteurs have brought the war to United States soil, blowing up trains, train stations, and moored ships. At the same time, U.S. agents prepare for the invasion of Sicily and Italy. Colacci becomes a sinister German, a Brit, a dusky Italian, a Southern belle, and more. His delivery is smooth, natural, and more versatile than one might expect of his rich baritone voice. His pace is just right, too, and he's accomplished at building suspense as the plot jumps from the Battle of the Atlantic to other worldwide locales such as London, Washington, and Algiers.

Spouse, parent, child, friend&#x2014;whoever your closest loved ones are, they warrant more than a passing glance; they deserve an intentional and meaningful relationship with you.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>One Month to Love </i>thirty-day challenge is the greatest adventure you&#x2019;ll ever take, helping you deepen the important relationships in your life. Authors Kerry and Chris Shook use timeless, biblical wisdom to walk through three stages of relationships: <i>First Glance, Second Look, </i>and <i>Lasting Love</i>. Many of us have launched into the exciting First Glance phase. When we then tiptoe into the Second Look, reality sets in, and often friendships weaken, families suffer, marriages crack. Now learn how to experience the deep, satisfying lifelong relationships of lasting love.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>All it takes is one chapter a day.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>If your marriage is broken, restoration is possible. If your friendship is frail, a fresh start is possible. Even if you&#x2019;ve made mistakes in all your relationships, lasting love is still possible. &#x201c;With God all things are possible&#x201d; (Matthew 19:26). <br>&nbsp;<br>Includes a weekly focus and daily readings to guide you through the process.</p></p><p><p><b>Kerry Shook</b> and his wife, <b>Chris Shook</b>, are the authors of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>One Month to Live </i>and the founders of Woodlands Church in The Woodlands, TX, one of the largest churches in America.

It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival</i>. &#x2014; C. S. LEWIS<br>&nbsp;<br><i>I don&#x2019;t wish to be everything to everyone, but I would like to be something to someone</i>. &#x2014; JAVAN<br>&nbsp;<br>Right now, there are three relationships in your life that trouble you. Perhaps a good friend said something to you yesterday. It felt critical, but you&#x2019;re not sure what she meant. The two of you used to be so close, but lately you&#x2019;ve been drifting apart. Something&#x2019;s not right. Oh, and your mother called. There&#x2019;s that. You know you should return her call, but you haven&#x2019;t. Why? You know there are things you should have said before, you avoided them, and now you feel it&#x2019;s too late. It&#x2019;s always so hard with her. Always messy. <br>And then...your son has been missing. Not missing physically, but he&#x2019;s been distant, quiet, silent. Missing emotionally. What&#x2019;s that about? What&#x2019;s going on in his life? You want to reach out, but he pushes you away. It worries you.<br>Maybe the relationships in your life aren&#x2019;t <i>exactly </i>like these, but I&#x2019;m guessing these remind you of someone close to you, a problem relationship in your life right now. Maybe it&#x2019;s not your mother but your father, perhaps not your son but a daughter-in-law. It could be your best friend. Whoever it is, he or she is someone who matters to you&#x2014;or else the relationship wouldn&#x2019;t trouble you, gnaw at you on the inside, make you question and grumble, or even bring you to tears.<br>I suggest you have at least three such relationships in your life right now that feel messy or troubling and make your heart ache a little. The number three isn&#x2019;t magic, of course. It could be just one or two, although it&#x2019;s likely to be more, not less. We all have relationships that aren&#x2019;t what we long for them to be. Now I&#x2019;m not talking about business acquaintances, casual or distant friends, fourth or fifth cousins. We all have a lot of relationships in our lives&#x2014;maybe too many (and we&#x2019;ll talk about that)&#x2014;but, quite frankly, not all are created equal. All people are important, but not every connection in your life has equal value. The relationships we want to help you with in this book probably include your husband or wife, possibly a boyfriend or girlfriend. Your mother or father could be on this list, or maybe a son or daughter. And there could be a friend, someone close to you with whom you&#x2019;ve shared deep things. It&#x2019;s these <i>meaningful, essential </i>people in your life&#x2014;the <i>key </i>relationships you have right now&#x2014;that we want to focus on.<br>So take a moment and think, who are these three key people in your life? Which meaningful relationships are troubling you? Relationships you wish were closer. Relationships you&#x2019;d like to be deeper and richer. Relationships that trouble you, bother you, even make you a little crazy right now. Seriously, think about it. Who are they? And now take a moment to name these three key relationships out loud.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>THE HIDDEN ADVENTURE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>The journey you&#x2019;re about to take over the next thirty days will help you improve, grow, and deepen those three relationships you just named. I&#x2019;m not saying it will fix everything (relationships aren&#x2019;t machines&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t replace a broken part and be good to go). But if you apply what you read over the next thirty days, your key relationships will grow and deepen. Something will change for the better.<br>Trust me, this is important for you. In fact, this may be the most significant thing you do in your life right now. Why? Because life is way too short. At the end of the day&#x2014;at the end of The Day&#x2014;in this all-too-short life we share, all that really matters is relationships.<br>Our relationships with the God who created us and with the people we love. Compared to these relationships, the job or career goals we set now aren&#x2019;t really so important, the ladders we try to climb don&#x2019;t matter so much, and the objects we long to own and possess seem utterly trivial. What really counts in the end is that special knowing look you share with your spouse, the arms of your child reaching up to you, or the quiet comfort of a friend who stands by your side in a difficult time. The award-winning animated movie <i>Up </i>contains some profound truths about relationships. In a breathtaking sequence early in the film, we see the entire arc of the life of Carl, a balloon salesman, as he meets Ellie, falls in love, and gets married. They share a dream to travel to South America and save every penny for their big trip. But there&#x2019;s something familiar about the way their savings are constantly being used for the urgencies and emergencies of daily life. Before Carl and Ellie know it, they&#x2019;re in their seventies, and although they have a beautiful marriage, they never realized their dream adventure. Ellie dies, and Carl is overwhelmed with regret about the trip they never took. In a desperate attempt to escape loneliness and recapture memories of Ellie, Carl attaches a bunch of balloons to his house and sets out for South<br>America!<br>You begin to realize as the movie progresses that this dream trip they were saving for, this object of their future plan together, wasn&#x2019;t really that important after all. The <i>real </i>adventure was the life they shared along the way. The same is true for us: the adventure of a lifetime is right in front of us. It&#x2019;s just cleverly disguised as a familiar face.<br>Think about the possible loss of the relationship with one of those three people you named. You can&#x2019;t do anything about death and the physical departure of one of them from this earth. That&#x2019;s in God&#x2019;s hands. But you can do something about your relationship with them in life.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>UPSIDE DOWN</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Everything you&#x2019;ve been told about relationships is upside down and wrong. Researchers tell us that a baby sees everything upside down for the first few days of life until the brain can adjust the visual picture to right side up. Most relationships today are stuck in this same infant stage; we tend to see relationships upside down, and our culture only reinforces this view. The concept of love at <i>first </i>sight permeates our music, movies, television, and books. What we learn as children and continue to believe as adults is that a fairy-tale relationship somehow just happens.<br>Now, I&#x2019;m not bashing romance, but meaningful relationships depend on seeing other people as they are and looking at them right side up. Real love&#x2014; whether romantic love, a close friendship, or a family relationship&#x2014;happens long after first sight. It shows up as people get to know each other more deeply and often after they work through tough things together. Real love in relationships isn&#x2019;t a magic act; it&#x2019;s a journey. When people say, &#x201c;It was love at first sight,&#x201d; what they really mean is &#x201c;I was attracted to that person the first time I saw them.&#x201d; There is nothing wrong with being infatuated with someone at the start of a relationship. The real question, however, is, do you have a love that is growing stronger and deeper every day?<br>I don&#x2019;t believe in love at first sight; I believe in love at last sight. <i>Each of my relationships has the potential to be better the next time we&#x2019;re together than it was the previous time so that the last time we see each other on this earth we&#x2019;re closer than ever before.</i><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>FRIEND ME</b><br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s ironic that even though our society is more technologically connected than ever before, most people feel increasingly isolated and completely disconnected from deep and rewarding relationships. You can have hundreds of Facebook friends, but how many of them can you truly sit down with face to face and share your heart? It&#x2019;s more important to have one good friend than a thousand acquaintances.<br>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong: there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with social networking. Those sites can serve a useful purpose in connecting us to people. Technology is, after all, neutral. What matters is how you use it. A fire can burn you or warm you, and technology is no different. You can go online to research a medical question, pay your electric bill&#x2014;or view pornography. The ability to connect with people online can be incredibly useful as long as you&#x2019;re smart about it, but it has its downside too.<br>The canary in the coal mine is this: social networking has changed our society&#x2019;s definition of <i>friend. </i>For instance, if I find someone named Joe online, all it takes is a simple right click, and my computer screen flashes a message assuring me that, yes, Joe and I are now friends. Hmm...now that we&#x2019;re friends, I wonder if Joe would drive me to the doctor when I&#x2019;m too sick to drive myself or hold my hair back from the toilet when I&#x2019;m throwing up. Should I count on him to help me out on moving day? Can I call him when my loyal dog has to be put down and I just can&#x2019;t do it alone? Will he tell me when I have spinach in my teeth, dandruff on my shirt, or my foot in my mouth? We have bought into the false idea that if we&#x2019;re connected to huge numbers of people in cyberspace, we must be important and loved. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with having lots of online friends as long as you realize that they&#x2019;re a random collection of people you might know or that someone you might know might know. A real friend is someone who is with you&#x2014;present in your life&#x2014; someone who gives you their time, shares your hurt, and feels your ache.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>HOPE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Almost every day we hear about another high-profile marriage meltdown or a lifelong friendship falling apart. We look at the relational carnage around us and wonder, is it even <i>possible </i>to build a marriage that lasts? Is it <i>possible </i>to have a friendship that grows stronger through the inevitable misunderstandings and mistakes of two imperfect people? Is it <i>possible </i>to experience love at <i>last</i> sight?<br>The answer is a resounding yes! The Bible says, &#x201c;With God all things are possible&#x201d; (Matthew 19:26). It doesn&#x2019;t say it&#x2019;s easy to build deep and rich relationships that stand the test of time, but we can say from personal experience that with God it&#x2019;s more than possible. The two of us have been married for more than twenty-five years, and we can honestly say we&#x2019;re more in love today than ever before. We&#x2019;re two imperfect people who don&#x2019;t have it all together or figured out, but we&#x2019;ve learned some principles from God&#x2019;s Word that have helped us develop a rich, unshakeable love for each other and for the most important people in our lives. We want to share with you these last-sight principles that continually help us see life and the people we love right side up&#x2014;from God&#x2019;s perspective.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>FIRST GLANCE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>All relationships, whether a marriage, a family, or a friendship, go through the same three stages. This First Glance stage is often called the honeymoon phase, that blissful time when everything is sunshine and rainbows. It&#x2019;s the time in a dating relationship when you think you&#x2019;ve finally met the perfect person, and all you can see is how alike you are. The honeymoon happens in family relationships too. But when children become self-thinking teenagers, parents and kids usually see one another&#x2019;s shortcomings more clearly. In a friendship the honeymoon begins when you think you&#x2019;ve finally found a friend who really &#x201c;gets&#x201d; you. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with those first infatuated feelings unless you expect them to always be there. The First Glance stage is intense but fleeting, and trying to make it long-term isn&#x2019;t realistic or even desirable!<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>SECOND LOOK</b><br>&nbsp;<br>At first everything seems beyond perfect, but then you take a second look. Suddenly you see reality staring back at you! In a friendship, as you get to the Second Look stage, you see your friend&#x2019;s annoying habits and negative qualities. In marriage, that second look makes you realize that the person you&#x2019;re married to is not so perfect after all. Suddenly you&#x2019;re able to see only your glaring differences, and you start to wonder what you saw in them in the first place. In the Second Look stage, you start asking, &#x201c;What happened? Where did all the loving feelings go?&#x201d; Nothing&#x2019;s actually wrong. Reality happened! And in a real way, it&#x2019;s good. Great relationships need to be based on reality&#x2014;the true understanding and acceptance of another&#x2019;s faults, shortcomings, and weaknesses. This is also the stage where we admit we&#x2019;re not so hot either! It&#x2019;s in this honest acceptance of each other&#x2014;acceptance of the real us, not the ideal first-glance us&#x2014;that relationships begin to grow. The danger of the Second Look stage is that it&#x2019;s easy to give up because we no longer have the sense of awe and wonder we had in the First Glance stage. Of the three key relationships you&#x2019;ve named, is one possibly in this Second Look stage?<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>LAST SIGHT</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Our goal is to help you get beyond the First Glance stage, which is by definition a shallow relationship, to move through the Second Look stage and not get stuck there, and to enter the Last Sight stage, where the real work and reward of relationships occur. The Last Sight stage is the point at which you know each other&#x2019;s faults, fears, and true feelings, but your love is secure as you work to grow closer every day. Last sight relationships are what this book is all about, and they always involve two people being honest, vulnerable, and feeling safe with each other. The reason you chose those unique three key relationships is precisely because you long for them to be last sight relationships. Maybe they&#x2019;re in the Second Look stage, and you recognize the need to move them into the Last Sight stage. Possibly they&#x2019;re still in the First Glance stage, and now you&#x2019;re beginning to realize all that it will take to move them deeper. No matter what stage you&#x2019;re in or how long you&#x2019;ve been there, the adventure of a lifetime awaits you in these pages.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>LOVE AT LAST SIGHT CHALLENGE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Love at last sight is a whole new way of living.

Sperry, Jr., Indiana Unviersity</strong></p> In this remarkable new book, M. H. Abrams definitively studies the Romantic Age (1789&#x2013;1835)&#x2015;the age in which Shelley claimed that "the literature of England has arisen as it were from a new birth." Abrams shows that the major poets of the age had in common important themes, modes of expression, and ways of feeling and imagining; that the writings of these poets were an integral part of a comprehensive intellectual tendency which manifested itself in philosophy as well as poetry, in England and in Germany; and that this tendency was causally related to drastic political and social changes of the age.<br><br> But Abrams offers more than a work of scholarship, for he ranges before and after, to place the age in Western culture. he reveals what is traditional and what is revolutionary in the period, providing insights into those same two forces in the ideas of today. He shows that central Romantic ideas and forms of imagination were secularized versions of traditional theological concepts, imagery, and design, and that modern literature participates in the same process. Our comprehension of this age and of our own time is deepened by a work astonishing in its learning, vision, and humane understanding.</p><p>M. H. Abrams (1912&#x2015;2015) was Class of 1916 Professor of English, Emeritus at Cornell University. He received the Phi Beta Kappa Christian Gauss Prize for The Mirror and the Lamp and the MLA's James Russell Lowell Prize for Natural Supernaturalism. He is also the author of The Milk of Paradise, A Glossary of Literary Terms, The Correspondent Breeze, and Doing Things with Texts. He is the recipient of Guggenheim, Ford Foundation, and Rockefeller Postwar fellowships, the Award in Humanistic Studies from the Academy of Arts and Sciences (1984), the Distinguished Scholar Award by the Keats-Shelley Society (1987), and the Award for Literature by the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1990). In 1999 The Mirror and the Lamp was ranked twenty-fifth among the Modern Library's "100 best nonfiction books written in English during the twentieth century."</p><h2>Rick Steves Croatia &amp; Slovenia</h2><p><b>Stroll Dubrovnik's ancient walls, hike the idyllic Julian Alps, and set sail on the glimmering Adriatic: with Rick Steves on your side, Croatia and Slovenia can be yours!

It was a swift-moving patch of darker darkness against the night sky, obliterating stars and birthing them again.<br><br> She pointed at it, shouting, "Singleton from the west, St. Ogdo save us!" in imitation of the knights of old. She spoiled the impression slightly by bouncing on her toes and laughing. The winter wind carried the cheerful sound away; far below us the city curled under a quilt of new snow, silent and thoughtful as a sleeping child.<br><br> Trained spotters had once scanned the skies for dragon battalions from this selfsame place, atop Castle Orison's Ard Tower. Tonight it was only the Queen and me, and the approaching "singleton" was a friend, thank Allsaints: the dragon Eskar, erstwhile undersecretary at our dragon embassy. She'd helped my uncle Orma evade the Censors almost three months ago, just as the dragon civil war was breaking out.<br><br> Ardmagar Comonot, the deposed leader of dragonkind, had expected Eskar to find Orma a safe haven and then return to us in Goredd, where Comonot had established his headquarters in exile. The Ardmagar had intended to make her one of his advisors, or even a general, but months had brought no Eskar and no explanation.<br><br> She had contacted Comonot, via quigutl device, earlier this evening. Over dinner, Comonot had informed Queen Glisselda that Eskar would fly in after midnight. Then he had taken himself off to bed, leaving the Queen to wait up or not, as she saw fit.<br><br> It was a very Comonot way of dealing with things. The Queen wearied of him.<br><br> He'd said nothing about why Eskar had suddenly decided to come back, or where she'd been. It was possible he didn't know. Glisselda and I had been speculating about it to distract ourselves from the cold. "Eskar has decided the dragon civil war is dragging on too long, and means to end it single-handedly," was Glisselda's final assessment. "Did she ever glare at you, Seraphina? She could stop the very planets in their spheres."<br><br> I hadn't experienced the glare, but I'd seen the way she looked at my uncle three months ago. Eskar had surely been with him this whole time.<br><br> Glisselda and I each held a torch, intending Eskar to understand that she should land on the tower top. This was Prince Lucian Kiggs's idea--something about updrafts and a fear that she'd take out a window trying to land in a courtyard. He had left unspoken the fact that she was less likely to alarm anyone way up here. Goredd had begun to see full-sized dragons in the sky, as Comonot's allies came and went, but it would be an exaggeration to say people were used to it.<br><br> Now that Eskar was approaching, she looked too large to land on the tower top. Maybe she thought so, too; flapping dark leathery wings with a rush of hot wind, she veered south toward the far edge of town. Three city blocks still smoldered there, sending the new snow up as steam.<br><br> "What's she doing, checking out her countryman's handiwork? Some insomniac is going to see her," said Glisselda, pushing back the hood of her fur-lined cloak, her earlier merriment already dimming to fretfulness. Alas, this was her usual expression these days. Her golden curls gleamed incongruously in the torchlight.<br><br> Eskar soared into the spangled sky and then plummeted back out of the darkness, diving toward the heart of the city like a falcon after a wren. Glisselda gasped in alarm. At the last second, Eskar pulled up short--a black shadow against the new snow--and skimmed along the frozen Mews River, cracking the ice with her serpentine tail.<br><br> "And now she reveals how she might breach our defenses, flying so high our missiles and flaming pyria can't reach her. That's not how those houses were razed, Eskar!" called the young Queen into the wind, as if the dragon could hear her from such a distance. "He was already inside the walls!"<br><br> He had been the third dragon assassin Prince Lucian had flushed out, sent after Comonot by the Old Ard. The saarantras had transformed into a full-sized dragon to make his escape. Comonot had transformed in turn and killed his assailant before he could flee, but five people had died and fifty-six lost their homes in the resulting inferno.<br><br> All that destruction, caused by just two dragons. None of us dared to guess how awful the damage would be if Comonot's Loyalists failed to hold off the Old Ard and war came to Goredd in earnest.<br><br> "Lars is designing new war machines," I said, trying to inject some optimism. "And don't discount the dracomachists training at Fort Oversea." The elderly knights of the Southlands and their middle-aged squires, hastily promoted to knights, had joined together in this endeavor.<br><br> Glisselda snorted derisively, her eyes following Eskar's second circuit of the city. "Even when our knights were at full strength--and quickly trained dracomachists are not knights--this city was routinely burned to the ground. You and I have never seen the like, having been raised in peacetime."<br><br> The wind gusted, making it hard to forget how high up we were; my palms sweated in my gloves. "Comonot's Loyalists will defend us."<br><br> "I believe they will defend our people, but the city itself doesn't matter a jot to them. Lucian says we must focus on making the tunnels livable again. We survived there before, and we can always rebuild." She raised an arm and dropped it, as if she found it futile even to gesture. "This city is Grandmamma's legacy; it has blossomed in peacetime. I hate that I might have to let it go."</p><h2>The Collected Short Stories of Louis L&#39;Amour, Volume 4: The Adventure Stories</h2><p>The fourth volume of Louis L&#x2019;Amour&#x2019;s collected short stories features more than forty of the master&#x2019;s greatest adventure tales in a keepsake edition to cherish for generations.

Now Frances and her daughter, Anna, pick up where <i>Diet for a Small Planet left</i> off. Together they set out on an around-the-world journey to explore the greatest challenges we face in the new millennium. Traveling to Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, they discovered answers to one of the most urgent issues of our time: whether we can transcend the rampant consumerism and capitalism to find the paths that each of us can follow to heal our lives as well as the planet.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Featuring nearly seventy recipes from celebrated vegetarian culinary pioneers-including Alice Waters, Mollie Katzen, Laurel Robertson, Nora Pouillon, and Anna Thomas-<i>Hope's Edge</i> highlights true trailblazers engaged in social, environmental, and economic transformations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Thirty years after Frances Lappe's <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> changed eating habits around the world, she and her daughter Anna bring us a new round of iconoclastic recommendations that break overwhelming issues down to a simple matter of personal choice. <i>Hope's Edge</i> presents many of the same issues of the original title, but it also provides a wealth of new discoveries and possibilities in this era of genetically engineered foods, worldwide famine, and growing rates of obesity-related health issues.<p> Beyond discussing a wide range of reasons to become a vegetarian (and that means no fish or chicken either, folks), the authors introduce you to a number of individual reasons for hope--Bob, the Wisconsin cheese maker; Jean-Yves, the farmer from Brittany who created the Sustainable Agriculture Network; and Muhammad Yunas, who has changed the lives of countless living in poverty with his remarkable microcredit programs. Along with these stories and the theories they're based on, you'll also find luscious recipes calling for grains, fruits, vegetables, and a handful of dairy products that will delight your taste buds <i>and</i> your conscience. </p><p> The Lappes firmly believe that the choices of low-level consumers have the potential to make positive changes, both in the world economy and in our physical health. By eating a vegetarian diet, shopping with care, and cooking with love, we might all brighten our future tremendously. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Frances Moore Lapp� is the author of <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> and eleven other books.</p><h2>Centerburg Tales</h2><p>A companion to <i>Homer Price</i>, these imaginative and outlandish tales from all-American Centerbury will leave you in stitches.

S. T. Joshi, Lovecraft's preeminent interpreter, presents a selection of the master's fiction, from the early tales of nightmares and madness such as "The Outsider" to the overpowering cosmic terror of "The Call of Cthulhu." More than just a collection of terrifying tales, this volume reveals the development of Lovecraft's mesmerizing narrative style and establishes him as a canonical - and visionary - American writer.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

P. Lovecraft</b>&nbsp;was born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, where he lived most of his life. Frequent illnesses in his youth disrupted his schooling, but Lovecraft gained a wide knowledge of many subjects through independent reading and study. He wrote many essays and poems early in his career, but gradually focused on the writing of horror stories, after the advent in 1923 of the pulp magazine&nbsp;<i>Weird Tales</i>, to which he contributed most of his fiction. His relatively small corpus of fiction&#x2014;three short novels and about sixty short stories&#x2014;has nevertheless exercised a wide influence on subsequent work in the field, and he is regarded as the leading twentieth-century American author of supernatural fiction. H. P. Lovecraft died in Providence in 1937.<br><br><b>S. T. Joshi</b>&nbsp;is a freelance writer and editor. He has edited Penguin Classics editions of H. P.

People knew the basics: men and women had sex, and sometimes babies followed. But beyond that the origins of life were a colossal mystery. <em>The Seeds of Life</em> is the remarkable and rollicking story of how a series of blundering geniuses and brilliant amateurs struggled for two centuries to discover where, exactly, babies come from. <br><br>Taking a page from investigative thrillers, acclaimed science writer Edward Dolnick looks to these early scientists as if they were detectives hot on the trail of a bedeviling and urgent mystery. These strange searchers included an Italian surgeon using shark teeth to prove that female reproductive organs were not 'failed' male genitalia, and a Catholic priest who designed ingenious miniature pants to prove that frogs required semen to fertilize their eggs.<br><br>A witty and rousing history of science, <em>The Seeds of Life</em> presents our greatest scientists struggling-against their perceptions, their religious beliefs, and their deep-seated prejudices-to uncover how and where we come from.<br></p><p><b>Edward Dolnick</b> is the former chief science writer for<i> The Boston Globe</i> and is the author of, among others, <i>The Rush</i> and <i>The Clockwork Universe</i>.

I can smell him.<br> <br>His stench is part the acrid sweat of exertion, part the meaty ripeness of a carnivore&#x2019;s unwashed flesh, and part something else I can&#x2019;t quite name. It fouls the evening air, stretching beyond smell to something deeper, more base. It unsettles me, sets my own instincts howling in warning. Cold sweat breaks out across my forehead. I wipe it away with the back of my hand.<br> <br>I can also smell the child he&#x2019;s stolen. Her scent is lighter, cleaner. Innocent. She smells alive to me, or at least she was alive when she left here. By now she could smell quite different.<br> <br>The door to the Lukachukai Chapter House swings open. A woman, likely the child&#x2019;s mother, sits stone-faced in an old dented metal folding chair at the front of the small meeting room. She&#x2019;s flanked by a middle-aged man in a Silver Belly cowboy hat and a teenage boy in army fatigues who looks a few years younger than me. The boy holds the woman&#x2019;s hand and murmurs in her ear.<br> <br>Most of the town of Lukachukai is here too. For support or for curiosity or because they are drawn to the spectacle of grief. They huddle in groups of two or three, hunched in morose clumps on the same battered gray chairs, breathing in stale air made worse by the bolted-up windows and the suffocating feel of too many people in too small a space. They are all locals, Navajos, or Din� as we call ourselves, whose ancestors have lived at the foothills of the Chuska Mountains for more generations than the bilag�anas have lived on this continent, who can still tell stories of relatives broken and murdered on the Long Walk or in Indian boarding schools like it was last year, who have likely never traveled off the reservation, even back when it was just a forgotten backwater ward of the United States and not Din�tah risen like it is today. These Din� know the old stories sung by the hataalii, the ancient legends of monsters and the heroes who slew them, even before the monsters rose up out of legend to steal village children from their beds. And now they are looking to me to be their hero.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m no hero. I&#x2019;m more of a last resort, a scorched-earth policy. I&#x2019;m the person you hire when the heroes have already come home in body bags.<br> <br>My moccasins make no noise as I cross the cracked tile floor to stand in front of the mother. Whispered conversations hush in my wake and heads turn to stare. My reputation obviously precedes me, and not all of the looks are friendly. A group of boys who must be the teenage boy&#x2019;s friends loiter along the far wall. They snicker loudly, eyes following me, and no one bothers to shush them. I ignore them and tell myself I don&#x2019;t care. That I&#x2019;m here to do a job and get paid, and what Lukachukai thinks of me beyond that doesn&#x2019;t matter. But I&#x2019;ve always been a terrible liar.<br> <br>The mother has only one question for me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you save her?&#x201d;<br> <br>Can I? That&#x2019;s the real question, isn&#x2019;t it? What good are my skills, my clan powers, if I can&#x2019;t save her?<br> <br>&#x201c;I can find her,&#x201d; I say. And I can, no doubt. But saving and finding are two different things. The mother seems to sense that, and she shuts her eyes and turns away from me.<br> <br>With a clearing of his throat, the man in the cowboy hat pushes himself up from his chair. He&#x2019;s wearing old faded Levi&#x2019;s that probably fit ten years ago but now shrink back to leave his belly protruding over his belt buckle. A similarly ill-fitting cowboy shirt covers his aging paunch, and the look he gives me through bloodshot eyes tells me he&#x2019;s already in mourning. That maybe he doesn&#x2019;t believe much in saving either.<br> <br>He introduces the mother, the boy, and then himself. First and last name, and then clans, like you&#x2019;re supposed to. He&#x2019;s the missing girl&#x2019;s uncle, the boy is her brother. They are all Begays, a last name as common here as Smith is to the bilag�anas. But his clans, the ancestral relations that make him Din� and decide our kinship obligations, are unfamiliar to me.<br> <br>He pauses, waiting for me to give my name and clans so he and the others can place me in their little world, decide our relations and what k&#x2019;� they might owe me. And what k&#x2019;� I owe them. But I don&#x2019;t oblige him. I&#x2019;ve never been much for tradition, and it&#x2019;s better all around if we just stay strangers.<br> <br>Finally, the older Begay nods, understanding I&#x2019;m not inclined toward proper Din� etiquette, and gestures to the cloth bag at his feet. &#x201c;This is all we have for trade,&#x201d; he says. His hands tremble as he speaks, which makes me think he&#x2019;s as bad a liar as I am, but he raises his chin defiantly, eyes wide under the brim of his hat.<br> <br>I step forward and crouch to look through the bag, doing the quick math in my head. The silver jewelry is nice&#x2014;beads, old stampworked bracelets, a few small squash blossoms&#x2014;even if the turquoise is sort of junk, missing the spidery veins that make the rocks worth big trade. I can exchange the silver for goods at the markets in Tse Bonito, but the turquoise is useless, no more than pretty blue stones.<br> <br>&#x201c;The turquoise is shit,&#x201d; I tell him.<br> <br>A loud grunt and the brother pushes his chair back. The metal feet screech across the tile in protest. He makes a show of crossing his arms in disgust.<br> <br>I ignore him and look back at the uncle. &#x201c;Maybe you should find someone else. Law Dogs or Thirsty Boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shakes his head, his moment of bravado leaking away under the weight of limited options. &#x201c;We tried. Nobody came. We wouldn&#x2019;t have sent a runner if we weren&#x2019;t . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Desperate. He doesn&#x2019;t have to say it. I get it.<br> <br>The runner was a kid on a motorbike. Short and squat, so runner was a bit of a misnomer, but he wore a pair of ancient Nikes, duct tape wrapped carefully thick around the toe and reinforcing the seam at the heel, so what do I know? He sat in my yard with the bike&#x2019;s motor idling loudly, making my dogs bark. I came to the door to tell him to go the hell away. That I wasn&#x2019;t in the monster-hunting business anymore. But he told me Lukachukai needed help and nobody else would come and there was a little girl and besides they were paying. I said it wasn&#x2019;t my problem, but the kid was persistent, and the truth was I was interested. All I&#x2019;d been doing the past nine months was staring at the walls of my trailer, so what else did I have to do? Plus, I was getting low on funds and could use the trade. So when the kid refused to leave, I decided I&#x2019;d go to Lukachukai. But now I&#x2019;m starting to regret it. I&#x2019;d forgotten in my months of self-imposed isolation how much I hate a crowd, and how much a crowd hates me.<br> <br>The uncle spreads his hands, eyes begging where words fail. &#x201c;I thought, maybe once you saw . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>And I do see. But I figure the Begays are holding out. Maybe they don&#x2019;t want to pay because I&#x2019;m a woman.<br> <br>Maybe because I&#x2019;m not Him.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is bullshit,&#x201d; the brother says loudly, and his challenge sends a nervous titter rippling through the gathering. &#x201c;What can she do that we can&#x2019;t do?&#x201d; He gestures to encompass his posse of friends along the wall. &#x201c;Clan powers? She won&#x2019;t even tell us what her clans are. And Neizgh�n�&#x2019;s apprentice? We only have her word for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the mention of Neizgh�n�&#x2019;s name my heart speeds up and I can&#x2019;t breathe past the knot in my throat. But I force myself to swallow down the familiar hurt, the ache of abandonment. The pathetic flutter of desire. I haven&#x2019;t been Neizgh�n�&#x2019;s anything for a long while now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not just her word,&#x201d; the uncle says. &#x201c;Everyone says it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone? Everyone says she&#x2019;s not right. That she&#x2019;s wrong, Navajo way. That&#x2019;s what everyone says.&#x201d;<br> <br>A general burst of murmuring through the crowd, comparing notes on my wrongness, no doubt. But the uncle quiets them down with a flapping wave of his hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the only one who came. What do you want me to do? Send her away? Leave your sister out there at night with that thing that took her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Send me!&#x201d; he shouts.<br> <br>&#x201c;No! The mountain&#x2019;s no place to be after dark. The monsters . . .&#x201d; His eyes flicker to me, the person he is willing to send up the mountain after dark. But there&#x2019;s nothing like consternation on his face. After all, he&#x2019;s paying me to risk my life, although it&#x2019;s a pretty stingy deal. The nephew is a relative, and another matter. &#x201c;We already lost one,&#x201d; he finishes weakly.<br> <br>For a moment the boy looks like he&#x2019;ll challenge his uncle, but he catches his mother&#x2019;s gaze and his shoulders fall. He exhales loudly and slumps in his seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared,&#x201d; he mutters, a final volley. But it&#x2019;s not true. He&#x2019;s all show in those army castoffs and he surrendered quick enough. I glance over at his boys against the wall. Quiet now, looking everywhere but at their friend. I revise his age down a few years.<br> <br>I let my eyes drift toward the boarded-up window where outside the sun is swiftly setting. If I had a watch, I&#x2019;d make a show of checking it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seems to me all this talk is just wasting my daylight,&#x201d; I tell them. &#x201c;Pay me what I&#x2019;m worth and let me do my job or don&#x2019;t pay and let me go home. Makes no difference to me.&#x201d; I pause before I look at the mother. &#x201c;But it might make a difference to your daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy flinches. I get a small tick of pleasure watching him flush in shame before a voice cuts through the heavy air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have clan powers?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the first thing the mother&#x2019;s said since she asked if I could find her daughter. She seems startled by her own outburst and raises her hands as if to cover her mouth. But she stops short, lowers her hands to her lap, and grips the fabric of her long skirt before she adds quietly, &#x201c;Like him, the Monsterslayer. The rumor is you do. That he taught you. That you&#x2019;re . . . like him.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not like Neizgh�n�, no. He is the Monsterslayer of legend, an immortal who is the son of two Holy People. I&#x2019;m human, a five-fingered girl. But I&#x2019;m not exactly normal, either, not like this brother and his friends. If the others asked, the boy or the uncle, I would refuse. But I won&#x2019;t deny a grieving mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hon�gh�ahnii, born for K&#x2019;aahan�anii.&#x201d; Only my first two clans, but that&#x2019;s enough.<br> <br>The crowd&#x2019;s muttered suspicions rise to vocal hostility, and one of the boys barks something ugly at me.<br> <br>The mother stands up, back straight, and silences the crowd with a hard stare. Her eyes fill with something fierce that stirs my sympathy in spite of my best efforts not to give a damn. &#x201c;We have more,&#x201d; she says. The uncle starts to protest, but she cuts him off, her voice louder, commanding. &#x201c;We have more trade. We&#x2019;ll pay. Just find her. Find my daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s my cue.<br> <br>I roll my shoulders, shifting the shotgun in the holster across my back. Habit makes me briefly palm the belt of shotgun shells at my waist and the B�ker hunting knife sheathed against my hip. Fingertips brush the throwing knives tucked in the tops of my moccasin wraps, silver on the right, obsidian on the left. I sling my pack over my shoulder and turn on silent feet, moving through the muted crowd. Keep my head up, my hands loose, and my eyes straight ahead. I push the door open and step out of the stifling Chapter House just as the brother shouts, &#x201c;What if you don&#x2019;t come back?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t bother to answer. If I don&#x2019;t come back, Lukachukai&#x2019;s got bigger problems than one missing girl.</p><h2>Tales of Neveryon</h2><p>1st Bantam 1979 edition paperback. vg condition.

Sojourning among the mysterious Aing-Tii monks has left Luke and his son Ben with no real answers, only the suspicion that the revelations they seek lie in the forbidden reaches of the distant Maw Cluster. There, hidden from the galaxy in a labyrinth of black holes, dwell the Mind Walkers: those whose power to transcend their bodies and be one with the Force is as seductive and intoxicating as it is potentially fatal.

A former game designer and editor, he lives in western Wisconsin with his wife, Andria.&nbsp;In the <i>Jade Shadow</i>'s forward canopy hung twin&nbsp;black holes, their perfect darkness surrounded by fiery&nbsp;whorls of accretion gas. Because the <i>Shadow </i>was&nbsp;approaching at an angle, the two holes had the oblong&nbsp;appearance of a pair of fire- rimmed eyes&#x2013; and Ben&nbsp;Skywalker was half tempted to believe that's what they&nbsp;were. He had begun to feel like he was being watched&nbsp;the instant he and his father had entered the Maw&nbsp;cluster, and the deeper they advanced, the stronger the&nbsp;sensation grew. Now, at the very heart of the concentration&nbsp;of black holes, the feeling was a constant chill&nbsp;at the base of his skull.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"I sense it, too," his father said. He was sitting&nbsp;behind Ben in the copilot's seat, up on the primary&nbsp;flight deck. "We're not alone in here."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;No longer surprised that the Grand Master of the&nbsp;Jedi Order always seemed to know his thoughts, Ben&nbsp;glanced at an activation reticle in the front of the cockpit.&nbsp;A small section of canopy opaqued into a mirror,&nbsp;and he saw his father's reflection staring out the side of&nbsp;the canopy. Luke Skywalker looked more alone and&nbsp;pensive than Ben ever remembered seeing him&#x2013;&nbsp;thoughtful, but not sad or frightened, as though he&nbsp;were merely trying to understand what had brought&nbsp;him to such a dark and isolated place, banished from&nbsp;an Order he had founded, and exiled from a society he&nbsp;had spent his life fighting to defend.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Trying not to dwell on the injustice of the situation,&nbsp;Ben said, "So maybe we're closing in. Not that I'm all&nbsp;that eager to meet a bunch of beings called the Mind&nbsp;Drinkers."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;His father thought for a moment, then said, "Well,&nbsp;I am."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;He didn't elaborate, and he didn't need to. Ben and&nbsp;his father were on a mission to retrace Jacen Solo's fiveyear&nbsp;odyssey of Force exploration. At their last stop,&nbsp;they had learned from an Aing- Tii monk that Jacen had&nbsp;been bound for the Maw when he departed the Kathol&nbsp;Rift. Since one purpose of their journey was to determine&nbsp;whether Jacen had been nudged toward the dark&nbsp;side by something on his voyage, it only made sense&nbsp;that Luke would want to investigate a mysterious&nbsp;Maw- dwelling group known as the Mind Drinkers.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;What impressed Ben, however, was how calm his&nbsp;father seemed about it all. Ben was privately terrified of&nbsp;falling victim to the same darkness that had claimed his&nbsp;cousin. Yet his father seemed eager to step into its depth&nbsp;and strike a flame. And why shouldn't he be? After&nbsp;everything that Luke Skywalker had suffered and&nbsp;achieved in his lifetime, there was no power in the&nbsp;galaxy that could draw him into darkness. It was a&nbsp;strength that both awed Ben and inspired him, one that&nbsp;he wondered if he would ever find himself.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke' s eyes shifted toward the mirrored canopy section,&nbsp;and he caught Ben's gaze. "Is this what bothered you&nbsp;when you were at Shelter?" He was referring to a time&nbsp;that was ancient history to Ben&#x2013;the last part of the war&nbsp;with the Yuuzhan Vong, when the Jedi had been forced to&nbsp;hide their young at a secret base deep inside the Maw.&nbsp;"Did you feel like someone was watching you?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "How should I know?" Ben asked, suddenly&nbsp;uneasy&#x2013; and unsure why. By all accounts, he had been&nbsp;an unruly, withdrawn toddler while he was at Shelter,&nbsp;and he recalled being afraid of the Force for years afterward.&nbsp;But he had no clear memories of Shelter itself, or&nbsp;what it had felt like to be there. "I was <i>two.</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"You <i>did </i>have feelings when you were two," his&nbsp;father said mildly. "You <i>did </i>have a mind."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben sighed, knowing what his father wanted, then&nbsp;said, "You'd better take the ship."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I have the ship," Luke confirmed, reaching for the&nbsp;copilot's yoke. "Just close your eyes. Let the Force carry&nbsp;your thoughts back to Shelter."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"I know how to meditate." Almost instantly, Ben felt&nbsp;bad for grumbling and added, "But thanks for the&nbsp;advice."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Don't mention it," Luke said in a good- natured&nbsp;way. "That's what fathers <i>do&#x2013;</i>offer unwanted advice."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben closed his eyes and began to breathe slowly and&nbsp;deliberately. Each time he inhaled, he drew the Force&nbsp;into himself, and each time he exhaled, he sent it flowing&nbsp;throughout his body. He had no conscious memories&nbsp;of Shelter that were his own, so he envisioned a holograph&nbsp;of the facility that he had seen in the Jedi Archives.&nbsp;The image showed a handful of habitation modules&nbsp;clinging to the surface of an asteroid fragment, their&nbsp;domes clustered around the looming cylinder of a power&nbsp;core. In his mind's eye, Ben descended into the gaudy&nbsp;yellow docking bay at the edge of the facility . . . and&nbsp;then he was two years old again, a frightened little boy&nbsp;holding a stranger's hand as his parents departed in the&nbsp;<i>Jade Shadow.&nbsp;<br><br></i>&nbsp;An unwarranted sense of relief welled up inside Ben&nbsp;as he grew lost in a time when life had seemed so much&nbsp;easier. The last fourteen years began to feel like a long,&nbsp;terrible nightmare. Jacen's fall to the dark side had&nbsp;never happened, Ben had not been molded into an adolescent&nbsp;assassin, and his mother had not died fighting&nbsp;Jacen. All those sad memories were still just bad&nbsp;dreams, the unhappy imaginings of a frightened young&nbsp;mind.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then the <i>Shadow </i>slipped through the containment&nbsp;field and ignited her engines. In the blink of an eye she&nbsp;dwindled from a trio of blue ion circles into a pinpoint&nbsp;of light to nothing at all, and suddenly Ben was alone&nbsp;in the darkest place in the galaxy, one child among&nbsp;dozens entrusted to a small group of worried adults&nbsp;who&#x2013;despite their cheerful voices and reassuring presences&#x2013;&nbsp;had very clammy palms and scary, anxious eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Two- year- old Ben reached toward the <i>Shadow </i>with&nbsp;his free hand and his heart, and he sensed his mother&nbsp;and father reaching back. Though he was too young to&nbsp;know he was being touched through the Force, he&nbsp;stopped being afraid . . . until a dark tentacle of need&nbsp;began to slither up into the aching tear of his abandonment.&nbsp;He thought for an instant that he was just sad&nbsp;about being left behind, but the tentacle grew as real as&nbsp;his breath, and he began to sense in it an alien loneliness&nbsp;as desperate and profound as his own. It wanted&nbsp;to draw him close and keep him safe, to take the place&nbsp;of his parents and never let him be alone again.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Terrified and confused, young Ben pulled away,&nbsp;simultaneously drawing in on himself and yanking his&nbsp;hand from the grasp of the silver- haired lady who was&nbsp;holding it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Then suddenly he was back in the cockpit of the <i>Jade&nbsp;Shadow, </i>staring into the fire- rimmed voids ahead.&nbsp;Scattered around their perimeter were the smaller&nbsp;whorls of half a dozen more distant rings, their fiery&nbsp;light burning bright and steady against the starless&nbsp;murk of the deep Maw.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Well?" his father asked. "Anything feel familiar?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben swallowed. He wasn't sure why, but he found&nbsp;himself wanting to withdraw from the Force all over&nbsp;again. "Are we sure we need to find these guys?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Luke raised a brow. "So it <i>is </i>familiar."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Maybe." Ben couldn't say whether the two feelings&nbsp;were related, and at the moment he didn't care. There&nbsp;was something hungry in the Maw, something that&nbsp;would still be there waiting for him. "I mean, the Aing-&nbsp;Tii call them Mind Drinkers. That can't be good."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Ben, you're changing the subject." Luke' s tone was&nbsp;more interested than disapproving, as though Ben's&nbsp;behavior were only one part of a much larger puzzle.&nbsp;"Is there something you don't want to talk about?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I wish." Ben told his father about the dark tentacle&nbsp;that had reached out to him after the <i>Shadow </i>departed&nbsp;Shelter so many years ago. "I guess what we're feeling&nbsp;now might be related. There was definitely&nbsp;some . . . <i>thing </i>keeping tabs on me at Shelter." &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Luke considered this for a moment, then shook his&nbsp;head. "You were pretty attached to your mother.&nbsp;Maybe you were just feeling abandoned and made up a&nbsp;'friend' to take her place."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"A <i>tentacle </i>friend?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"You said it was a <i>dark </i>tentacle," Luke continued&nbsp;thoughtfully, "and guilt is a dark emotion. Maybe you&nbsp;were feeling guilty about replacing us with an imaginary&nbsp;friend."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"And maybe <i>you </i>don't want to believe the tentacle&nbsp;was real because it would mean you left your two- yearold&nbsp;son someplace really dangerous," Ben countered.&nbsp;He caught his father's eye in the mirrored section again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I hope you're not going to try to psychoanalyze this&nbsp;away, because there's a big hole in your theory."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Luke frowned. "And that would be?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"I was <i>two,</i>" Ben reminded him. "And by all accounts,&nbsp;I didn't feel guilty about <i>anything </i>at that age."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke grinned. "Good point, but I still don't think we&nbsp;should worry too much about this tentacle monster of&nbsp;yours."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"It's not <i>my </i>tentacle monster," Ben retorted, miffed&nbsp;at having his concerns mocked. "You're the one who&nbsp;made me dredge it up."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke's expression hardened into admonishment.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"But <i>you're </i>the one who's still afraid of it."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The observation struck home. Whether or not the&nbsp;dark presence he remembered was real, he had emerged&nbsp;from Shelter wary of abandonment and frightened of&nbsp;the Force. And it had been those fears that had allowed&nbsp;Jacen to lead him into darkness.&nbsp;<br><br>Ben sighed. "Right. Whatever this thing is, I've got to&nbsp;face it." After a moment, he asked, "So how do we find&nbsp;these Mind Drinkers?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;" 'The Path of True Enlightenment runs through the&nbsp;Chasm of Perfect Darkness.' " Luke was quoting&nbsp;Tadar'Ro, the Aing- Tii monk who had told them that&nbsp;Jacen had left the Kathol Rift to search out the Mind&nbsp;Drinkers. " 'The way is narrow and treacherous, but if&nbsp;you can follow it, you will find what you seek.' "&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben swung his gaze toward the black holes ahead. The&nbsp;brilliant whorls of their accretion disks were burning&nbsp;hottest and brightest along their inner rims, where a mixture&nbsp;of in- falling gas and dust was being compressed to&nbsp;unimaginable densities as it vanished into the sharpedged&nbsp;darkness of twin event horizons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Wait. Tadar'Ro said <i>perfect </i>darkness, right?" Ben&nbsp;started to have a bad feeling about the monk's instructions.&nbsp;"Like, beyond an event horizon?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Actually, it' s probably very bright on the way down&nbsp;a black hole," Luke pointed out. "Just because gravity&nbsp;is too strong for light to escape doesn't mean it can't&nbsp;exist, and there' s all that gas compressing and glowing&nbsp;as it's sucked deeper and deeper."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Yeah, but you're <i>dead,</i>" Ben said, "and everything&nbsp;is dark when you're dead. Still, I see what you mean. I&nbsp;doubt Tadar'Ro expects us to fly down a black hole."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No, not <i>down </i>one."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;There was just enough anxiety in Luke's voice to&nbsp;make Ben glance into the mirrored section again. His&nbsp;father was frowning out at the two black holes, staring&nbsp;into the fiery cloud between them and looking just&nbsp;worried enough to twist Ben's stomach into a cold&nbsp;knot.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"<i>Between </i>them?" Ben could see what his father was&nbsp;thinking, and it didn't make him happy. In any system&nbsp;of two large bodies, there were five areas where the&nbsp;centrifugal and gravitational forces would neutralize&nbsp;each other and hold a smaller body&#x2013;such as a satellite&nbsp;or asteroid&#x2013;in perpetual equilibrium. Of those five&nbsp;locations, only one was directly <i>between </i>the two bodies.&nbsp;"You mean Stable Zone One?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke nodded. "The Chasm of Perfect Darkness is an&nbsp;ancient Ashla parable referring to the twin perils of ego&nbsp;and ignorance," he explained. "The Tythonians spoke&nbsp;of it as a deep dark canyon flanked by high, evercrumbling&nbsp;cliffs."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"So life is the chasm, darkness is falling all around,"&nbsp;Ben said, taking an educated guess as to the parable's&nbsp;meaning, "and the only way to stay in the light is to go&nbsp;down the middle."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke smiled. "You've got a real feeling for mystic&nbsp;guidance." He lifted his hands away from the yoke.&nbsp;"You have the ship, son."&nbsp;<br><br><i>&nbsp;"Me? Now?" </i>Ben considered pointing out that his&nbsp;father was by far the better pilot&#x2013;but that wasn' t the&nbsp;issue, of course. If Ben was going to face his fears, he&nbsp;needed to handle the flying himself. He swallowed&nbsp;hard, squared his shoulders, then confirmed, "I have&nbsp;the ship."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben deactivated the mirror panel and accelerated&nbsp;toward the black holes. As the <i>Shadow </i>drew closer,&nbsp;their dark orbs rapidly began to swell and drift toward&nbsp;opposite sides of the cockpit, until all that could be seen&nbsp;of them were tall slivers of darkness hanging along the&nbsp;rear edges of the canopy. Ahead lay a fiery confluence&nbsp;of superheated gas, swirling in from two different directions&nbsp;and so bright it hurt Ben's eyes even through the&nbsp;<i>Shadow</i>'s blast- tinting.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;He checked the primary display and found only&nbsp;bright static; the navigation sensors were awash in electromagnetic&nbsp;blast from compressing gas. The <i>Shadow</i>'s&nbsp;internal sensors were working just fine, however, and&nbsp;they showed the ship's hull temperature rising rapidly&nbsp;as they penetrated the cloud. It wouldn't take long for&nbsp;that to become dangerous, Ben knew. Soon the fierce&nbsp;heat inside the accretion disk would start fouling guidance&nbsp;systems and control relays. Eventually, it would&nbsp;compromise hull integrity.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Dad, how about doing something with those sensor&nbsp;filters?" Ben asked. "My navigational readings are&nbsp;snow."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;"Adjusting the filters won't change anything," Luke&nbsp;said calmly. "We're flying between a pair of black holes<i>,&nbsp;</i>remember?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben exhaled in exasperation, then cursed under his&nbsp;breath and continued to stare out into the fiery ribbons&nbsp;ahead. At best, he could make out a confluence zone&nbsp;where the two accretion disks were brushing against&nbsp;each other, and the painful brilliance made it dif...</p><h2>Bell, Book and Candle: A Comedy in Three Acts</h2><p>For 3 males and 2 females.

The discovery inspired her to embark on a year-long voyage through her books, forsaking new purchases in order to get to know her own collection again.<br><br>A book which is left on a shelf for a decade is a dead thing, but it is also a chrysalis, packed with the potential to burst into new life. Wandering through her house that day, Hill's eyes were opened to how much of that life was stored in her home, neglected for years. Howard's End is on the Landing charts the journey of one of the nation's most accomplished authors as she revisits the conversations, libraries and bookshelves of the past that have informed a lifetime of reading and writing.<br></p><p>Susan Hill is the winner of numerous prestigious literary awards. She is the author of a highly successful crime series (Overlook Press) as well as the famous <i>The Woman in Black</i>, the stage production of which has been running internatoinally for years.*Starred Review* One day British novelist Susan Hill went to the bookshelves in her home looking for a copy of Howards End. She didn&#x2019;t find it (at least not at first), but she did come upon several other books she had never read. That started her thinking: Why not devote a year&#x2019;s reading time just to the books on her own shelves? The project launched, she began a systematic browse through all the books in her house (it&#x2019;s an old house with lots of floors and shelves on every floor, not to mention the landings between floors). This delightful bibliophile&#x2019;s memoir records her experience, both the browsing and the reading. Along the way, she developed a kind of second project: If she could only keep 40 books, which ones would they be? The list of 40 appears at the end, and it&#x2019;s a charmingly eccentric batch of books, but the real fascination in reading Hill&#x2019;s ruminations isn&#x2019;t about the list but, rather, about how she reads and how living with books enriches her life. Those who collect books in any fashion will be lost in their own memories as Hill muses on &#x201c;things that fall out of books,&#x201d; or defends writing in books, or, best of all, argues against overorganizing the books on her shelves (no more wonderful surprises).

But he made the mistake of falling in love, which gave him something to lose&#x2014;or to be taken from him. Captured by the Nazis, Michael was treated as an experiment. A piece of meat. A subject upon which his captors committed atrocity upon atrocity. But not before they did the same to his wife&#x2014;and unborn son. He's lived with the horror of that experience for ten years. Now, Michael Rogan has returned to Europe to find the men who tortured him. And he's going to make sure that they never have to live with the horror as he did...They will die with it.<br><br>First published under a pseudonym in 1967, <i>Six Graves to Munich</i> was Mario Puzo&#x2019;s literary predecessor to his legendary novel, <i>The Godfather</i>. In this unsung classic, Puzo&#x2019;s trademark unflinchingly stark writing style, vivid descriptive skill, and relentless pace are exemplified in the genre of the spy novel. In his hands, the classic tale of revenge becomes a haunting study of humanity at its most visceral, offering a glimpse into a damaged soul whose only remaining purpose for living is to kill.</p><p>The son of Italian immigrants who moved to the Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen area of New York City, <b>Mario Puzo</b> was born on October 15, 1920. After World War II, during which he served as a U.S. Army corporal, he attended City College of New York on the G.I. Bill and worked as a freelance writer. During this period he wrote his first two novels<i> The Dark Arena</i> (1955) and <i>The Fortunate Pilgrim </i>(1965).<br><br>When his books made little money despite being critically acclaimed, he vowed to write a bestseller. <i>The Godfather</i> (1969) was an enormous success. He collaborated with director Francis Ford Coppola on the screenplays for all three Godfather movies and won Academy Awards for both <i>The Godfather</i> (1972) and <i>The Godfather, Part II</i> (1974). He also collaborated on the scripts for such films as <i>Superman </i>(1978), <i>Superman II </i>(1981), and <i>The Cotton Club</i> (1984).&nbsp;He continued to write phenomenally successful novels, Including <i>Fools Die </i>(1978), <i>The Sicilian</i> (1984), T<i>he Fourth K </i>(1991), and <i>The Last Don</i> (1996).&nbsp;Mario Puzo died on July 2, 1999. His final novel, <i>Omerta</i>, was published in 2000.First published under a pseudonym in 1967, two years before <i>The Godfather</i>, this thin revenge thriller from Puzo (1920&#x2013;1999) grafts elements of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> onto a post-WWII European setting. Ten years after American Michael Rogan was left for dead by the Nazis and miraculously survived what should have been a fatal head wound in 1945, Rogan, now the millionaire owner of a computer company, returns to Europe for revenge. After dispatching the first of seven men who murdered his pregnant wife and interrogated him to get Rogan to disclose the Allies' secret codes, the avenger hooks up with Rosalie, a prostitute with a heart of gold, who becomes his companion and assistant. Displaying little of the sophisticated plotting or fully fleshed characterizations that distinguished Puzo's best work, this reissue won't add much luster to his reputation. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They want you to self-destruct, cleaning up any loose ends as they begin the grooming process with their latest victim. They destroy you as a way to reassure themselves that their new target is better. But most importantly, they destroy you because they hate you. They despise your empathy &amp; love,&nbsp;qualities they must pretend to feel every single day.

The goal is to make the process a bit more holistic,&nbsp;to provide all the tools you'll need to find validation, self-respect, peace, &amp; love.

It will open your eyes to human nature, our broken society, and, perhaps most important of all, your own spirit. It&#x2019;s a dark journey that will throw you into spells of depression, rage, and loneliness. It will unravel your deepest insecurities, leaving you with a lingering emptiness that haunts your every breath.</p><p>But ultimately, it will heal you.</p><p>You will become stronger than you could ever imagine. You will understand who you are truly meant to be. And in the end, you will be glad it happened.</p><p>No one ever believes me about that last part. At least, not at first. But I promise you, it&#x2019;s an adventure worth taking. One that will change your life forever.</p><p>So what is a psychopath? How about a narcissist or a sociopath? They&#x2019;re manipulative people&#x2014;completely devoid of empathy&#x2014;who intentionally cause harm to others without any sense of remorse or responsibility. And despite some differences between each disorder, the bottom line is that their relationship cycles can be predicted like clockwork: Idealize, Devalue, Discard.</p><p>Years ago, this cycle had me thinking I&#x2019;d never be happy again. Falling in love had somehow wiped out my entire sense of self. Instead of being joyful and trusting, I had become an unrecognizable mess of insecurities and anxiety.</p><p>But life is a lot of fun these days&#x2014;mostly just running around outside in my bathing suit and eating pizza. And this is all thanks to a lucky Google search that led me to psychopathy, which led me to the friends who saved my life, which led us to cofound a tiny online recovery community, which now reaches millions of survivors every month!</p><p>At PsychopathFree.com, we see new members join every single day, always with a seemingly hopeless and all-too-familiar tale. Left feeling lost and broken, they wonder if they will ever find happiness again.</p><p>One year later, that person is nowhere to be found.</p><p>In his or her place, there is a beautiful stranger who stands tall and helps others out from the shadows. A stranger who takes pride in their own greatest qualities: empathy, compassion, and kindness. A stranger who speaks of self-respect and boundaries. A stranger who practices introspection in order to better conquer their own demons.</p><p>So what happened in that year?</p><p>Well, a lot of good stuff. So much that I had to write a book. I might be biased&#x2014;actually, I definitely am&#x2014;but I think PsychopathFree.com has one of the coolest healing processes out there. We believe in education, open dialogue, validation, and self-discovery. We have a uniquely inspiring user base, full of resilient values and honest friendships.</p><p>Yes, friendships. Because this journey is personal, but it&#x2019;s also remarkably universal. Whether it be a whirlwind romance, a scheming coworker, an abusive family member, or a life-consuming affair, a relationship with a psychopath is always the same. Your mind is left spinning. You feel worthless and lost. You become numb to the things that once made you happy.</p><p>I cannot fix a toxic relationship (because toxic people cannot change), but I can give you a new place to start. And I can promise that you will feel joy again. You will learn to trust your intuition. You will walk this world with the wisdom of a survivor and the gentle wonder of a dreamer.</p><p>But first, you&#x2019;ll need to forget everything you thought you knew about people. Understanding psychopathy requires letting go of your basic emotional instincts. Remember, these are people who prey on forgiveness. They thrive on your need for closure. They manipulate compassion and exploit sympathy.</p><p>Since the dawn of time, psychopaths have waged psychological warfare on others&#x2014;humiliating and shaming kind, unsuspecting victims&#x2014;people who never asked for it; people who aren&#x2019;t even aware of the war until it&#x2019;s over.</p><p>But this is all about to change.</p><p>So say farewell to love triangles, cryptic letters, self-doubt, and manufactured anxiety. You will never again find yourself desperately awaiting a text from the person you love. You will never again censor your spirit for fear of losing the &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; relationship. You will never again be told to stop overanalyzing something that urgently needs analysis. You are no longer a pawn in the mind games of a psychopath. You are free.</p><p>And now it&#x2019;s time for your adventure.</p><p>Love,<br>Jackson</p><p></p><p></p><p>Spotting Toxic People</p><p>Your strengthened intuition is the greatest defense against a manipulative person. It is a skill that can never be exploited&#x2014;and once learned, it will serve you a lifetime.</p><p>30 Red Flags</p><p>There are a lot of phenomenal studies on the traits and characteristics of psychopaths. A quick Internet search will lead you to them. The red flags in this book are intended to supplement these resources.</p><p>So what&#x2019;s different about this list? Well, for one, it&#x2019;s specifically about relationships. But it&#x2019;s also about you. Each point requires introspection and self-awareness. Because if you want to spot toxic people, you cannot focus entirely on their behavior&#x2014;that&#x2019;s only half the battle. You must also come to recognize the looming red flags in your own heart. Then you will be ready for anything.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Gaslighting and crazy-making.</b> They blatantly deny their own manipulative behavior and ignore evidence when confronted with it. They become dismissive and critical if you attempt to disprove their fabrications with facts. Instead of them actually addressing their inappropriate behavior, somehow it always becomes <i>your</i> fault for being &#x201c;sensitive&#x201d; and &#x201c;crazy.&#x201d; Toxic people condition you to believe that the problem isn&#x2019;t the abuse itself, but instead your reactions to their abuse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Cannot put themselves in your shoes, or anyone else&#x2019;s, for that matter</b>. You find yourself desperately trying to explain how they might feel if you were treating them this way, and they just stare at you blankly. You slowly learn not to communicate your feelings with them, because you&#x2019;re usually met with silence or annoyance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>The ultimate hypocrite. </b>&#x201c;Do as I say, not as I do.&#x201d; They have extremely high expectations for fidelity, respect, and adoration. After the idealization phase, they will give none of this back to you. They will cheat, lie, criticize, and manipulate. But you are expected to remain perfect, otherwise you will promptly be replaced and deemed unstable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Pathological lying and excuses.</b> There is always an excuse for everything, even things that don&#x2019;t require excusing. They make up lies faster than you can question them. They constantly blame others&#x2014;it is never their fault. They spend more time rationalizing their behavior than improving it. Even when caught in a lie, they express no remorse or embarrassment. Oftentimes, it almost seems as if they <i>wanted</i> you to catch them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Focuses on your mistakes and ignores their own.</b> If they&#x2019;re two hours late, don&#x2019;t forget that you were once five minutes late to your first date. If you point out their inappropriate behavior, they will always be quick to turn the conversation back on you. You might begin to adopt perfectionist qualities, very aware that any mistake can and will be used against you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>You find yourself explaining the basic elements of human respect to a full-grown man or woman.</b> Normal people understand fundamental concepts like honesty and kindness. Psychopaths often appear to be childlike and innocent, but don&#x2019;t let this mask fool you. No adult should need to be told how he or she is making other people feel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Selfishness and a crippling thirst for attention.</b> They drain the energy from you and consume your entire life. Their demand for adoration is insatiable. You thought you were the only one who could make them happy, but now you feel that anyone with a beating pulse could fit the role. However, the truth is: no one can fill the void of a psychopath&#x2019;s soul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Accuses you of feeling emotions that they are intentionally provoking.</b> They call you jealous after blatantly flirting with an ex&#x2014;often done over social networking for the entire world to see. They call you needy after intentionally ignoring you for days on end. They use your manufactured reactions to garner sympathy from other targets, trying to prove how &#x201c;hysterical&#x201d; you&#x2019;ve become. You probably once considered yourself to be an exceptionally easygoing person, but an encounter with a psychopath will (temporarily) turn that notion upside down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>You find yourself playing detective.</b> It&#x2019;s never happened in any other relationship, but suddenly you&#x2019;re investigating the person you once trusted unconditionally. If they&#x2019;re active on Facebook, you start scrolling back years on their posts and albums. Same with their ex. You&#x2019;re seeking answers to a feeling you can&#x2019;t quite explain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>You are the only one who sees their true colors.</b> No matter what they do, they always seem to have a fan club cheering for them. The psychopath uses these people for money, resources, and attention&#x2014;but the fan club won&#x2019;t notice, because this person strategically distracts them with shallow praise. Psychopaths are able to maintain superficial friendships far longer than relationships.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>You fear that any fight could be your last.</b> Normal couples argue to resolve issues, but psychopaths make it clear that negative conversations will jeopardize the relationship, especially ones regarding their behavior. Any of your attempts to improve communication will typically result in the silent treatment. You apologize and forgive quickly, otherwise you know they&#x2019;ll lose interest in you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Slowly and steadily erodes your boundaries.</b> They criticize you with a condescending, joking sort of attitude. They smirk when you try to express yourself. Teasing becomes the primary mode of communication in your relationship. They subtly belittle your intelligence and abilities. If you point this out, they call you sensitive and crazy. You might begin to feel resentful and upset, but you learn to push away those feelings in favor of maintaining the peace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>They withhold attention and undermine your self-esteem.</b> After once showering you with nonstop attention and admiration, they suddenly seem completely bored by you. They treat you with silence and become very annoyed that you&#x2019;re interested in continuing the passionate relationship that <i>they</i> created. You begin to feel like a chore to them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>They expect you to read their mind.</b> If they stop communicating with you for several days, it&#x2019;s your fault for not knowing about the plans they never told you about. There will always be an excuse that makes them out to be the victim to go along with this. They make important decisions about the relationship and they inform everyone except you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>You feel on edge around this person, but you still want them to like you.</b> You find yourself writing off most of their questionable behavior as accidental or insensitive, because you&#x2019;re in constant competition with others for their attention and praise. They don&#x2019;t seem to care when you leave their side&#x2014;they can just as easily move on to the next source of energy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>An unusual number of &#x201c;crazy&#x201d; people in their past.</b> Any ex-partner or friend who did not come crawling back to them will likely be labeled jealous, bipolar, an alcoholic, or some other nasty smear. Make no mistake: they will speak about you the same way to their next target.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Provokes jealousy and rivalries while maintaining their cover of innocence.</b> They once directed all of their attention to you, which makes it especially confusing when they begin to withdraw and focus on other people. They do things that constantly make you doubt your place in their heart. If they&#x2019;re active on social media, they&#x2019;ll bait previously denounced exes with old songs, photos, and inside jokes. They attend to the &#x201c;competition&#x2019;s&#x201d; activity and ignore yours.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Idealization, love-bombing, and flattery.</b> When you first meet, things move extremely fast. They tell you how much they have in common with you&#x2014;how perfect you are for them. Like a chameleon, they mirror your hopes, dreams, and insecurities in order to form an immediate bond of trust and excitement. They constantly initiate communication and seem to be fascinated with you on every level. If you have a Facebook page, they might plaster it with songs, compliments, poems, and inside jokes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Compares you to everyone else in their life.</b> They compare you to ex-lovers, friends, family members, and your eventual replacement. When idealizing, they make you feel special by telling you how much better you are than these people. When devaluing, they use these comparisons to make you feel jealous and inferior.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>The qualities they once claimed to admire about you suddenly become glaring faults.</b> At first, they appeal to your deepest vanities and vulnerabilities, observing and mimicking exactly what they think you want to hear. But after you&#x2019;re hooked, they start to use these things against you. You spend more and more time trying to prove yourself worthy to the very same person who once said you were perfect.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Cracks in their mask.</b> There are fleeting moments when the charming, cute, innocent persona is replaced by something else entirely. You see a side to them that never came out during the idealization phase, and it is a side that&#x2019;s cold, inconsiderate, and manipulative. You start to notice that their personality just doesn&#x2019;t add up&#x2014;that the person you fell in love with doesn&#x2019;t actually seem to exist.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Easily bored.</b> They are constantly surrounded by other people, stimulated and praised at all times. They can&#x2019;t tolerate being alone for an extended period of time. They become quickly uninterested by anything that doesn&#x2019;t directly impact them in a positive or thrilling way. At first, you might think they&#x2019;re exciting and worldly, and you feel inferior for preferring familiarity and consistency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Triangulation.</b> They surround themselves with former lovers, potential mates, and anyone else who provides them with added attention. This includes people that the psychopath may have previously denounced and declared you superior to. This makes you feel confused and creates the perception that the psychopath is in high demand at all times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Covert abuse.</b> From an early age, most of us were taught to identify physical mistreatment and blatant verbal insults, but with psychopaths, the abuse is not so obvious. You likely won&#x2019;t even understand that you were in an abusive relationship until long after it&#x2019;s over.

This took but little time. Two members of my family elected to go with me. Also a carbuncle. The dictionary says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel. Humor is out of place in a dictionary." &#x2014; <i>Following the Equator</i><br>So begins this classic piece of travel writing, brimming with Twain's celebrated brand of ironic, tongue-in-cheek humor. Written just before the turn of the century, the book recounts a lecture tour in which he circumnavigated the globe via steamship, including stops at the Hawaiian Islands, Australia, Fiji Islands, New Zealand, India, South Africa and elsewhere.<br>View the world through the eyes of the celebrated author as he describes a rich range of experiences &#x2014; visiting a leper colony in Hawaii, shark fishing in Australia, tiger hunting, diamond mining in South Africa, and riding the rails in India, an activity Twain enjoyed immensely as suggested by this description of a steep descent in a hand-car: <br>"The road fell sharply down in front of us and went corkscrewing in and out around the crags and precipices, down, down, forever down, suggesting nothing so exactly or so uncomfortably as a crooked toboggan slide with no end to it. . . . I had previously had but one sensation like the shock of that departure, and that was the gaspy shock that took my breath away the first time that I was discharged from the summit of a toboggan slide. But in both instances the sensation was pleasurable &#x2014; intensely so; it was a sudden and immense exaltation, a mixed ecstasy of deadly fright and unimaginable joy. I believe that this combination makes the perfection of human delight."<br>A wealth of similarly revealing observations enhances this account, along with perceptive descriptions and discussions of people, climate, flora and fauna, indigenous cultures, religion, customs, politics, food, and many other topics. Despite its jocular tone, this book has a serious thread running through it, recording Twain's observations of the mistreatments and miseries of mankind. Enhanced by over 190 illustrations, including 173 photographs, this paperback edition &#x2014; the only one avai1able &#x2014; will be welcomed by all admirers of Mark Twain or classic travel books.</p><p></p></p><p>After the Civil War, Samuel Clemens (1835-1910) left his small town to seek work as a riverboat pilot. As Mark Twain, the Missouri native found his place in the world. Author, journalist, lecturer, wit, and sage, Twain created enduring works that have enlightened and amused readers of all ages for generations.When Mark Twain took off by ship for a round-the-world lecture tour, he took along a sharp eye, a notebook, and his renowned wit. Michael Kevin reads Twain&#39;s narrative of his experiences with a Southern-inflected drawl and an unhurried pace that sound just right. He also offers amusing individual character shadings for many of Twain&#39;s fellow passengers, whom the great writer often quotes as well as skewers. The book is full of everything from onboard whist games to tiger hunting. Twain&#39;s opinions are many, often mercilessly funny, and frequently ahead of their time--except when he is suddenly of his time. The result is a fully developed self-portrait, nineteenth-century mores and all.

All he knows when he wakes up the next day in the hospital is that his head is sore and bandaged.<br><br>His effort to recover the moments of his life that have been stolen from him leads him on an unexpected detour. What he needs is someone who can do the remembering for him. What he gets is&#x2014;well, something quite different.<br><br>We all know a Liam. In fact, there may be a little of Liam in each of us. Which is why Anne Tyler&#x2019;s lovely novel resonates so deeply.</p><p>Anne Tyler<b> </b>was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1941 and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. This is her eighteenth novel. Her eleventh, <i>Breathing Lessons,</i> was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1988. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She lives in Baltimore, Maryland.In the sixty-first year of his life, Liam Pennywell lost his job. It wasn&#x2019;t such a good job, anyhow. He&#x2019;d been teaching fifth grade in a second-rate private boys&#x2019; school. Fifth grade wasn&#x2019;t even what he&#x2019;d been trained for. <i>Teaching</i> wasn&#x2019;t what he&#x2019;d been trained for. His degree was in philosophy. Oh, don&#x2019;t ask. Things seemed to have taken a downward turn a long, long time ago, and perhaps it was just as well that he had seen the last of St. Dyfrig&#x2019;s dusty, scuffed corridors and those interminable after-school meetings and the reams of niggling paperwork.<br><br>In fact, this might be a sign. It could be just the nudge he needed to push him on to the next stage&#x2014;the final stage, the summing-up stage. The stage where he sat in his rocking chair and reflected on what it all meant, in the end.<br><br>He had a respectable savings account and the promise of a pension, so his money situation wasn&#x2019;t out-and-out desperate. Still, he would have to economize. The prospect of economizing interested him. He plunged into it with more enthusiasm than he&#x2019;d felt in years&#x2014;gave up his big old-fashioned apartment within the week and signed a lease on a smaller place, a one-bedroom-plus-den in a modern complex out toward the Baltimore Beltway. Of course this meant paring down his possessions, but so much the better. Simplify, simplify! Somehow he had accumulated far too many encumbrances. He tossed out bales of old magazines and manila envelopes stuffed with letters and three shoe boxes of index cards for the dissertation that he had never gotten around to writing. He tried to palm off his extra furniture on his daughters, two of whom were grown-ups with places of their own, but they said it was too shabby. He had to donate it to Goodwill. Even Goodwill refused his couch, and he ended up paying 1-800-GOT-JUNK to truck it away. What was left, finally, was compact enough that he could reserve the next-smallest-size U-Haul, a fourteen-footer, for moving day. <br><br>On a breezy, bright Saturday morning in June, he and his friend Bundy and his youngest daughter&#x2019;s boyfriend lugged everything out of his old apartment and set it along the curb. (Bundy had decreed that they should develop a strategy before they started loading.) Liam was reminded of a photographic series that he&#x2019;d seen in one of those magazines he had just thrown away. <i>National Geographic</i>?<i> Life</i>? Different people from different parts of the world had posed among their belongings in various outdoor settings. There was a progression from the contents of the most primitive tribesman&#x2019;s hut (a cooking pot and a blanket, in Africa or some such) to a suburban American family&#x2019;s football-field-sized assemblage of furniture and automobiles, multiple TVs and sound systems, wheeled racks of clothing, everyday china and company china, on and on and on. His own collection, which had seemed so scanty in the gradually emptying rooms of his apartment, occupied an embarrassingly large space alongside the curb. He felt eager to whisk it away from public view. He snatched up the nearest box even before Bundy had given them the go-ahead. <br><br>Bundy taught phys ed at St. Dyfrig. He was a skeletal, blue-black giraffe of a man, frail by the looks of him, but he could lift astonishing weights. And Damian&#x2014;a limp, wilted seventeen-year-old&#x2014;was getting paid for this. So Liam let the two of them tackle the heavy stuff while he himself, short and stocky and out of shape, saw to the lamps and the pots and pans and other light objects. He had packed his books in small cartons and so those he carried too, stacking them lovingly and precisely against the left inner wall of the van while Bundy singlehandedly wrestled with a desk and Damian tottered beneath an upside-down Windsor chair balanced on top of his head. Damian had the posture of a consumptive&#x2014;narrow, curved back and buckling knees. He resembled a walking comma. <br><br>The new apartment was some five miles from the old one, a short jaunt up North Charles Street. Once the van was loaded, Liam led the way in his car. He had assumed that Damian, who was below the legal age for driving a rental, would ride shotgun in the van with Bundy, but instead he slid in next to Liam and sat in a jittery silence, chewing on a thumbnail and lurking behind a mane of lank black hair. Liam couldn&#x2019;t think of a single thing to say to him. When they stopped for the light at Wyndhurst he contemplated asking how Kitty was, but he decided it might sound odd to inquire about his own daughter. Not until they were turning off Charles did either of them speak, and then it was Damian. &#x201c;Swingin&#x2019; bumper sticker,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Since there were no cars ahead of them, Liam knew it had to be his own bumper sticker Damian meant. (<i>BUMPER STICKER</i>, it read&#x2014;a witticism that no one before had ever seemed to appreciate.) &#x201c;Why, thanks,&#x201d; he said. And then, feeling encouraged: &#x201c;I also have a T-shirt that says <i>T-SHIRT</i>.&#x201d; Damian stopped chewing his thumbnail and gaped at him. Liam said, &#x201c;Heh, heh,&#x201d; in a helpful tone of voice, but still it seemed that Damian didn&#x2019;t get it.<br><br>The complex Liam was moving to sat opposite a small shopping mall. It consisted of several two-story buildings, flat-faced and beige and bland, placed at angles to each other under tall, spindly pines. Liam had worried about privacy, seeing the network of paths between buildings and the flanks of wide, staring windows, but during the whole unloading process they didn&#x2019;t run into a single neighbor. The carpeting of brown pine needles muffled their voices, and the wind in the trees above them made an eerily steady whispering sound. &#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; Damian said, presumably meaning the sound, since he had his face tipped upward as he spoke. He was under the Windsor chair again. It loomed like an oversized bonnet above his forehead.<br><br>Liam&#x2019;s unit was on the ground floor. Unfortunately, it had a shared entrance&#x2014;a heavy brown steel door, opening into a dank-smelling cinderblock foyer with his own door to the left and a flight of steep concrete steps directly ahead. Second-floor units cost less to rent, but Liam would have found it depressing to climb those stairs every day.<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t given much thought beforehand to the placement of his furniture. Bundy set things down any old where but Damian proved unexpectedly finicky, shoving Liam&#x2019;s bed first one way and then another in search of the best view. &#x201c;Like, you&#x2019;ve got to see out the window first thing when you open your eyes,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;or how will you know what kind of weather it is?&#x201d; The bed was digging tracks across the carpet, and Liam just wanted to leave it where it stood. What did he care what kind of weather it was? When Damian started in on the desk&#x2014;it had to be positioned where sunlight wouldn&#x2019;t reflect off the computer screen, he said&#x2014;Liam told him, &#x201c;Well, since I don&#x2019;t own a computer, where the desk is now will be fine. That about wraps things up, I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t own a computer!&#x201d; Damian echoed.<br><br>&#x201c;So let me just get you your money, and you can be on your way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But how do you, like, communicate with the outside world?&#x201d;<br><br>Liam was about to say that he communicated by fountain pen, but Bundy said, chuckling, &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Then he clapped a hand on Liam&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Okay, Liam, good luck, man.&#x201d;<br><br>Liam hadn&#x2019;t meant to dismiss Bundy along with Damian. He had envisioned the two of them sharing the traditional moving-day beer and pizza. But of course, Bundy was providing Damian&#x2019;s ride back. (It was Bundy who&#x2019;d picked up the U-Haul, bless him, and now he&#x2019;d be returning it.) So Liam said, &#x201c;Well, thank you, Bundy. I&#x2019;ll have to have you over once I&#x2019;m settled in.&#x201d; Then he handed Damian a hundred and twenty dollars in cash. The extra twenty was a tip, but since Damian pocketed the bills without counting them, the gesture felt like a waste. &#x201c;See you around,&#x201d; was all he said. Then he and Bundy left. The inner door latched gently behind them but the outer door, the brown steel one, shook the whole building when it slammed shut, setting up a shocked silence for several moments afterward and emphasizing, somehow, Liam&#x2019;s sudden solitude.<br><br>Well. So. Here he was.<br><br>He took a little tour. There wasn&#x2019;t a lot to look at. A medium-sized living room, with his two armchairs and the rocking chair facing in random directions and filling not quite enough space. A dining area at the far end (Formica-topped table from his first marriage and three folding chairs), with a kitchen alcove just beyond. The den and the bathroom opened off the hall that led back to the bedroom. All the floors were carpeted with the same beige synthetic substance, all the walls were refrigerator white, and there were no moldings whatsoever, no baseboards or window frames or door frames, none of those gradations that had softened the angles of his old place. He found this a satisfaction. Oh, his life was growing purer, all right! He poked his head into the tiny den (daybed, desk, Windsor chair) and admired the built-in shelves. They had been a big selling point when he was apartment hunting: two tall white bookshelves on either side of the patio door. Finally, finally he&#x2019;d been able to get rid of those glass-fronted walnut monstrosities he had inherited from his mother. It was true that these shelves were less spacious. He&#x2019;d had to consolidate a bit, discarding the fiction and biographies and some of his older dictionaries. But he had kept his beloved philosophers, and now he looked forward to arranging them. He bent over a carton and opened the flaps. Epictetus. Arrian. The larger volumes would go on the lower shelves, he decided, even though they didn&#x2019;t need to, since all the shelves were exactly, mathematically the sa...</p><h2>Macrolichens of the Pacific Northwest</h2><p>A key component in healthy ecosystems, lichens can be found in almost any natural habitat in the Pacific Northwest.

Here is a fresh new reading of the American Revolution that gives voice and recognition to a generation of radical thinkers and doers whose revolutionary ideals outstripped those of the Founding Fathers.<br><br>While the Founding Fathers advocated a break from Britain and espoused ideals of republican government, none proposed significant changes to the fabric of colonial society. As privileged and propertied white males, they did not seek a revolution in the modern sense; instead, they tried to maintain the underlying social structure and political system that enabled men of wealth to rule. They firmly opposed social equality and feared popular democracy as a form of &#x201c;levelling.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet during this &#x201c;revolutionary&#x201d; period some people <i>did</i> believe that &#x201c;liberty&#x201d; meant &#x201c;liberty for all&#x201d; and that &#x201c;equality&#x201d; should be applied to political, economic, and religious spheres. Here are the stories of individuals and groups who exemplified the radical ideals of the American Revolution more in keeping with our own values today. This volume helps us to understand the social conflicts unleashed by the struggle for independence, the Revolution&#x2019;s achievements, and the unfinished agenda it left for future generations to confront.</p><p><b>Alfred F.

Nash<br></i><br><br>"All men are created equal,&#x201d; our first founding document declared. Men are &#x201c;endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,&#x201d; including &#x201c;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; These truths might be self-evident, as the Declaration of Independence stated boldly, but historically they are enigmatic. A majority of the fifty-six men who subscribed to such noble thoughts enslaved other human beings. Thomas Jefferson certainly did, but he alone is not the puzzle, nor is slavery the only inconsistency. What, exactly, did Jefferson and his colleagues mean by &#x201c;created equal&#x201d;? Was a shoemaker&#x2019;s son, at birth, really created equal to the son of a wealthy merchant? Did women have the same unalienable rights as men? Were blacks as well as whites entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Such notions frightened most of the prominent men we think of today as the Founding Fathers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Eleven years after the Declaration, when the framers of the Constitution devised &#x201c;a more perfect union,&#x201d; they did so, in part, to prevent an &#x201c;excess of democracy&#x201d; (a phrase they repeated often) from sweeping the young nation. The framers pejoratively labeled threats to their wealth and political power as &#x201c;leveling&#x201d; and those to their political power as &#x201c;democratic.&#x201d; Political, social, and economic equality were not what the framers had in mind. The disparity between words and deeds presents a particular problem for history- proud Americans who see the founders as guiding, patriarchal exemplars of their most cherished ideals. Searching for a moral resolution to this conundrum, typical American textbooks today assert that though all people were not treated equally in America in 1776, the Declaration of Independence set high goals for equal treatment in the future. This has become our nation&#x2019;s standard fallback response. By treating liberty and equality as &#x201c;promises&#x201d; to future generations, we simultaneously acquit the founders of culpability and affirm our national commitment to these high goals. It&#x2019;s a clever remedy, but factually it does not ring true. While some of the men who commanded slave labor hoped the institution would end someday, and a handful freed their slaves in their wills, that was as far as they went. With few exceptions, the gentlemen who drafted and signed our two founding documents opposed popular democracy and social equality. Our high goals were not theirs. They did not hold fundamental values that we accept as common currency today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although the Declaration of Independence claimed that people had &#x201c;the right to alter or abolish&#x201d; their form of government if they had exhausted all other means to express their grievances, the traditional founders did not wish to &#x201c;alter or abolish&#x201d; the institutional structures that protected their claim to rule. Once an elective government was established, traditional founders suppressed political rebellion. They did not want people to significantly alter, much less abolish, the structures they had just created. By contrast, many of their contemporaries wanted to strike at the heart of existing inequalities and radicalize governmental structures. Our protagonists in this book wanted to extend the lofty principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence to areas of life that the traditional founders never intended. These people <i>did </i>have a sense of the promise of the Revolution, and they wanted to fulfill it in their own time. Sharing no single agenda, they acted in the spirit of the words of Thomas Paine: &#x201c;We have it in our power to begin the world over again.&#x201d; The new nation was &#x201c;a blank sheet to write upon,&#x201d; Paine wrote,1 and on that sheet they placed their marks. Their actions were many and varied:<br>&nbsp;<br>� Common farmers, artisans, and laborers often led the resistance to imperial policies, moving the colonies toward independence while reshaping the character of political life in North America.<br>� Slaves emancipated themselves by fleeing to freedom, then established their own viable communities.<br>�Women staked claims to &#x201c;equality of the sexes&#x201d; and to retain rights to their own property in marriage.<br>� Persecuted religious dissenters pushed for, and obtained, &#x201c;the free exercise of religion.&#x201d;<br>� Resisting the inequities of rank, soldiers carried democratic values into the military.<br>� Native Americans claimed sovereignty and fought to defend it, with a spirit of independence that paralleled that of colonists.<br>� Farmers threatened with the loss of their land resorted to collective action, including taking up arms.<br>� Printers published what they wanted, overriding attempts to repress them.<br>� Self- proclaimed democrats, turning that term of derision on its head, won the right of ordinary people to vote, hold public office, and pass judgment on their rulers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of these &#x201c;Revolutionary founders,&#x201d; as we call them here, were <i>radicals </i>in the literal sense of the word: they promoted root changes in the very structure of social or political systems. One of those fundamental changes, of course, was independence from Britain, a goal they shared with the traditional founders, but often they pushed for others. Many of these people can also be considered <i>rebels, </i>either because they forcibly challenged British authority or because they confronted old or new hierarchies. Finally, some might best be described as <i>reformers </i>who sought to change a particular feature of society while leaving others intact. <br>&nbsp;<br>Each of these rebels, radicals, and reformers moved the American Revolution in some direction the traditional founders did not want to take, extending it farther and deeper than a separation from the British Empire. They made the Revolution more revolutionary.</p></p><h2>Miniature Rooms: The Thorne Rooms at the Art Institute of Chicago</h2><p><p>The Thorne Rooms, sixty-eight miniature models of European interiors from the 16th century on and American furnishings from the 17th century on, have entranced generations of visitors to the Art Institute of Chicago. This charming book showcases these rooms, featuring full-color views of each one as well as eight two-page spreads of some of the most spectacular interiors. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The introductory essay by Bruce Hatton Boyer chronicles how Chicago socialite Mrs. James Ward Thorne conceived the rooms. They were made between 1934 and 1940 by a number of skilled craftsmen according to her exacting specifications. Many of the rooms were inspired by specific interiors in historic houses, palaces, and sites Mrs. Thorne visited during her travels, and Fannia Weingartner&#x2019;s individual commentaries provide information about each one. In addition, a number of Mrs. Thorne&#x2019;s original drawings are reproduced to actual scale.&nbsp; </p></p><p><p>The late <b>Fannia Weingartner</b> was the editor of <i>Chicago History</i> and the head of the publications office at the Chicago Historical Society (now the Chicago History Museum). <b>Bruce Hatton Boyer</b> is a historian and novelist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"Instead of merely cataloguing, the late Weingartner offers a privileged 'behind the scenes' peak into the intention, production, and reception of the Thorne Collection. . . .

She began painting in 1991, after being a teacher of literature all of her working life. Within 18 months she was exhibiting landscapes in local juried shows. Initially self-taught, she began studying art history, painting, color theory, drawing and design, and became known as an abstractionist, and later developed her text-and-image collages. As a full-time artist, she continues to break rules and experiment, currently with encaustic.<p><b>Drawing Media</b></p><p>Pens, pencils, pastels, and oil crayons are all useful in mixed-media painting.

For a more creative approach, try using acrylic ink (FW inks come in many different colors) with a calligraphic nib pen.</p><p>Graphite pencils are not entirely waterproof, but if a layer of soft gel medium is brushed over gently, the marks will be prevented from dissolving into a gray mess when the next layer is applied.</p><p>Cheap oil pastels contain very little oil and plenty of filler, making them very suitable for layered work. Unlike true oil sticks, they will not entirely resist acrylics, so they can be easily covered up. They also write well on even the most plastic acrylic paint. The dry particles in charcoal and soft pastels make them vulnerable to lifting by wet media, so it&#x2019;s best to avoid using them.</p><p>The ingredients of crayons and colored pencils vary widely. Those with hard leads will not deposit color on a polymer medium or paint surface. The softer and creamier the pencil, the more likely they are to work. Of course, you can always use colored pencils to decorate your pieces of paper collage before they are stuck down. Black-and-white images colored in with colored pencils can be fun. Be absolutely sure that you are not using water-soluble crayons or pencils&#x2014;usually labeled &#x201c;watercolor&#x201d;&#x2014;or the marks will turn to wet paint when subsequent layers of paint are added. Caran d&#x2019;Ache makes stick wax-oil crayons called Neocolor I, which work extremely well on top of acrylics, even when there is texture underneath. Though more expensive than most drawing crayons, they are waterproof, lightfast, and come in a variety of colors.</p></p><h2>50 Psychology Classics: Who We Are, How We Think, What We Do: Insight and Inspiration from 50 Key Books (50 Classics)</h2><p>With 50 Psychology Classics: Who We Are, How We Think, What We Do-Insight and Inspiration, Tom Butler-Bowdon introduces readers to the great works that explore the very essence of what makes us who we are.

With its rich colours, towering height and luminous needles, the tree was a scientific marvel, beloved by the local Haida people who believed it sacred. The Golden Spruce tells the story of the sadness which pushed Hadwin to such a desperate act of destruction - a bizarre environmental protest which acts as a metaphor for the challenge the world faces today. But it also raises the question of what then happened to Hadwin, who disappeared under suspicious circumstances and remains missing to this day. Part thrilling mystery, part haunting depiction of the ancient beauty of the coastal wilderness, and part dramatic chronicle of the historical collision of Europeans and the native Haida, The Golden Spruce is a timely portrait of man&#39;s troubled relationship with a vanishing world.</p><p>In the tradition of Krakauer's Into the Wild, The Golden Spruce tells an astonishing true story of a furious man's obsessive mission against an industrial juggernaut, the struggle of the Haida people to save their world, and the mysterious golden tree that binds them all together. <br>When a kayak and camping gear are found on an uninhabited Alaskan island just north of the Canadian border, they re-ignite a mystery surrounding a shocking act of protest that made international news. On a winter night in 1997, a logger-turned-activist named Grant Hadwin plunged into the frigid waters of the Yakoun River in the Queen Charlotte Islands, towing a chainsaw behind him. When he was done, a unique spruce tree -- 50 meters tall and covered with luminous golden needles -- was teetering on its massive stump. <br>The tree, which baffled scientists, was sacred to the Haida on whose land it had stood for over 300 years. It was also beloved by local loggers who singled it out for protection in the midst of vast clear cuts. Since the 1970s, the mist-shrouded archipelago -- one of the continent's most pristine and vibrant ecosystems -- has been a battleground with government officials and logging companies squaring off against the Haida and environmental groups. The loss of the mythic golden spruce united loggers, natives and environmentalists in sorrow and outrage. But while heroic efforts were made to revive the tree, Grant Hadwin, the tree's confessed killer, disappeared under suspicious circumstances. <br>John Vaillant's article on the death of the golden spruce was published in 2002 in "The New Yorker, and this book has grown out of it, dramatizing the destruction of a deeply conflicted man and thewilderness he loved; in so doing, it traces the rise, fall and rebirth of the Haida nation, and exposes the logging industry -- the most dangerous land-based job in North America -- from a point of view never explored in contemporary non-fiction. <p>"To look at this seedling -- if one could see it at all -- and believe that it had every intention of growing into one of the towering columns that blot out so much of the northwestern sky, would have seemed far-fetched at best. In its first year, the infant tree would have been about two inches tall and sporting a half dozen or so pale green needles. It would have been appealing in the same abstract way that baby snapping turtles are, its alien appearance transcended by the universal indicators of wild babyhood: utter helplessness and primordial determination in equal measure. Despite its bristling ruff and a stem as straight as a sunbeam, the seedling was still as vulnerable as a frog's egg; a falling branch, the footstep of a human or an animal -- any number of random occurrences -- could have finished it there and then. <br>Down there, in the damp darkness of the under story, the sapling's wonderful flaw was a well-kept secret. With each passing year, it dug its roots deeper into the riverbank, strengthening its grip on life and on the land. In spite of the odds, it became one of a handful of young trees that would survive to shoulder their way into the sunlight, competing with giants a dozen feet wide and hundreds of feet tall. In the end, it would be the sun that exposed this tree's secret for all to see and, by the middle of the 1700s, it would have been abundantly clear that something extraordinary was growing on the banks of theYakoun. It was a creature that seemed more at home in a myth or a fairy tale: a spruce tree with golden needles.<br>--excerpt from The Golden Spruce</p>John Vaillant has written for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Outside, National Geographic Adventure, and Men&#39;s Journal among others.

On her rolling shores the game of golf had its origins, and to walk the links of St. Andrews is to feel at one with the shepherd who decided one day to see how far he could whack a stone with his crook. Most serious golfers will make the pilgrimage to Scotland, to try to hit the Postage Stamp green at Troon, to trace the footsteps of Ben Hogan at Carnoustie, and to brave the challenge of the Road Hole at St. Andrews; all golfers dream of taking such a trip. For the tourist or the dreamer, there can be no better guide than James W. Finegan. A passionate advocate of the game that&#39;s played on the links between land and sea, Finegan combines a writer&#39;s eye, a historian&#39;s knowledge, and a golfer&#39;s sense of wonder and apprehension to provide an impossibly ambitious grand tour of golf&#39;s native land. In a loop of a thousand miles that begins in Edinburgh and ends across the Firth of Forth in St. Andrews, Finegan covers some sixty courses, visiting the true shrines of the game, the courses that are well known and respected, and the little-known gems you might otherwise pass right by. He shares the history of the courses, both of their creation and of the most famous matches played there; he also writes marvelously about the scenic and strategic charms to be found as you play them yourself. And he provides all the information you need to make your arrangements to do just that -- because, unlike most championship courses in the United States, the great courses of Scotland are available to the public. In addition to his delightful descriptions of the golf to be found there, Finegan gives us his recommendations for places to stay, ranging from the most modest bed-and-breakfast to the most magnificent castle hotel. He describes the pleasures to be found off the beaten track: the spectacular views from a country road, or the ancient cathedral that&#39;s worth a stop on the way to the first tee. And because all the travel within the country is done by car, he spells out the actual routes from town to town and course to course. Blasted Heaths and Blessed Greens is a book to be read, to be savored, and to be tucked away in your suitcase when you finally undertake the journey of your dreams.</p><p>Scotland's famous golf courses come alive in this memoir from the former golf columnist and author of <i>Emerald Fairways and Foam Flecked Seas</i>. With plenty of detours (the author's wife doesn't play golf), Finegan captures the spirit of the sport's hallowed backyard.James W. Finegan has made thirty-five trips to the United Kingdom and Ireland since 1971, always with his golf clubs in tow. He has written extensively about the pleasures of links golf for <i>Golf</i> Magazine, <i>Golf Journal,</i> the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer,</i> and a variety of publications.

Then the American heirs to the castle turn up - energetic mother and her two eligible young sons. The stage is set for a romantic comedy.</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain wants to become a writer. Trouble is, she's the daughter of a once-famous author with a severe case of writer's block. Her family--beautiful sister Rose, brooding father James, ethereal stepmother Topaz--is barely scraping by in a crumbling English castle they leased when times were good. Now there's very little furniture, hardly any food, and just a few pages of notebook paper left to write on. Bravely making the best of things, Cassandra gets hold of a journal and begins her literary apprenticeship by refusing to face the facts. She writes, "I have just remarked to Rose that our situation is really rather romantic, two girls in this strange and lonely house. She replied that she saw nothing romantic about being shut up in a crumbling ruin surrounded by a sea of mud."<p> Rose longs for suitors and new tea dresses while Cassandra scorns romance: "I know all about the facts of life. And I don't think much of them." But romantic isolation comes to an end both for the family and for Cassandra's heart when the wealthy, adventurous Cotton family takes over the nearby estate. Cassandra is a witty, pensive, observant heroine, just the right voice for chronicling the perilous cusp of adulthood. Some people have compared <i>I Capture the Castle</i> to the novels of Jane Austen, and it's just as well-plotted and witty. But the Mortmains are more bohemian--as much like the Addams Family as like any of Austen's characters. Dodie Smith, author of <i>101 Dalmations</i>, wrote this novel in 1948. And though the story is set in the 1930s, it still feels fresh, and well deserves its reputation as a modern classic. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>"<i>I Capture the Castle</i> is finally back in print. It should be welcomed with a bouquet of roses and a brass band. Ever since I was handed a tattered copy years ago with the recommendation 'You'll love it,' it has been one of my favorite novels. Cassandra Mortmain is one hell of a narrator, offering sharp wit, piercing insight and touching lyricism. She is a heroine we readers wish we could be, a young woman it is impossible not to adore." --Susan Isaacs<p> "Dreamy and funny...an odd, shimmering timelessness clings to its pages. A thousand and one cheers for its reissue. A+" --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p> "It is an occasion worth celebrating when a sparkling novel, a work of wit, irony and feeling is brought back into print after an absence of many years. So uncork the champagne for <i>I Capture the Castle</i>." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p> "It's as fresh as if it were written this morning and as classic as Jane Austen. I'm very happy to have met it." --Donald Westlake</p><p> "A delicious, compulsively readable novel about young love and its vicissitudes. What fun!" --Erica Jong</p><p> "Much more fun than the reader has any right to expect." --<i>The Weekly Standard</i></p></p><h2>The Most They Ever Had</h2><p>In spring of 2001, a community of people in the Appalachian foothills came to the edge of all they had ever been. Across the South, padlocks and logging chains bound the doors of silent mills, and it seemed a miracle to blue-collar people in Jacksonville, Alabama, that their mill survived. The century-old hardwood floors still trembled under whirling steel, and people worked on in a mist of white air. The mill had become almost a living thing, rewarding the hard-working and careful with the best payday they ever had, but punishing the careless and clumsy, taking a finger, a hand, more. The mill preceded the automobile, the airplane, and they served it even as it filled their lungs with lint and shortened their lives. In return, it let them live in stiff-necked dignity in the hills of their fathers. In these real-life stories, Rick Bragg brilliantly evokes the hardscrabble lives of those who lived and died by an American cotton mill.</p><p>RICK BRAGG is the author of three best-selling books, Ava s Man, All Over but the Shoutin , and The Prince of Frogtown. As a feature writer for the New York Times, he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1996 for his elegantly written stories about contemporary America. He divides his time between New Orleans and his native Alabama.Rick Bragg warns us in his introduction that these are not happy stories, and he is right. They are, however, stories worth hearing and knowing, in the tradition of James Agee&#39;s LET US NOW PRAISE FAMOUS MEN. Bragg&#39;s work memorializes the community of Jacksonville, Alabama, and its way of life, and he reads it in its own voice and language. Southern speech doesn&#39;t rush, and it may take a while to get used to Bragg&#39;s pace and pauses. But he grew up among the mill hands he writes about and, while he doesn&#39;t distinguish the different characters as an actor would and doesn&#39;t always make clear where quotations begin and end, he does bring them lovingly to life.

If not, it will be because that one would not follow the very clear and simple instructions given. The teaching is from the Bible, yet it must be described as unique. Nowhere else will you find such unusual, but Biblically authenticated thoughts: He will teach you that contentment lies in subtraction, not in addition; that the ABC&#39;s of Christianity are nothing like what you thought them to be; that there is a mystery of contentment, but that once you have learned the way from Christ&#39;s word, you will be able to attain such a depth of contentment as you never before dreamed existed. This is a key book for building up Christian maturity. Christian Contentment, what is it? &#39;&#39;It is a sweet, inward heart thing. It is a work of the Spirit indoors. It is a box of precious ointment, very comforting and useful for troubled hearts in times of troubled conditions.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;It is the inward submission of the heart.&#39;&#39; The Mystery of Contentment: The mystery of it is that a Christian can be the most contented person, yet unsatisfied. He can be content with whatever portion God gives him, give him the whole world and it cannot satisfy him. That is the mystery of it. The Art of Contentment: &#39;&#39;I have learned to be content.&#39;&#39; To learn, first one must know his ABC&#39;s. The ABC&#39;s of contentment are: 1. I am nothing in myself. Christ is all in all. 2. I deserve nothing. What I have from God, I do not deserve. 3. I can do nothing. Christ says, &#39;&#39;Apart from Me, you can do nothing&#39;&#39; Wanting to do something without Christ is evil. 4. I am vile. By nature I am not only an empty vessel, but corrupt. 5. I can make use of nothing, if with it God withdraws Himself. 6. I am worse than nothing, for sin has made me so. 7. If I perish, nothing will be lost. God can raise up someone else.

But history teaches us that these great crises also represent opportunities to remake our economy and society and to generate whole new eras of economic growth and prosperity. In terms of innovation, invention, and energetic risk taking, these periods of "creative destruction" have been some of the most fertile in history, and the changes they put into motion can set the stage for full-scale recovery. </p><p>In <em>The Great Reset</em>, bestselling author and economic development expert Richard Florida provides an engaging and sweeping examination of these previous economic epochs, or "resets." He distills the deep forces that have altered physical and social landscapes and eventually reshaped economies and societies. Looking toward the future, Florida identifies the patterns that will drive the next Great Reset and transform virtually every aspect of our lives&#x2014;from how and where we live, to how we work, to how we invest in individuals and infrastructure, to how we shape our cities and regions. Florida shows how these forces, when combined, will spur a fresh era of growth and prosperity, define a new geography of progress, and create surprising opportunities for all of us. Among these forces will be</p><ul><li>new patterns of consumption, and new attitudes toward ownership that are less centered on houses and cars</li><li>the transformation of millions of service jobs into middle class careers that engage workers as a source of innovation</li><li>new forms of infrastructure that speed the movement of people, goods, and ideas</li><li>a radically altered and much denser economic landscape organized around "megaregions" that will drive the development of new industries, new jobs, and a whole new way of life</li></ul><p>We've weathered tough times before. They are a necessary part of economic cycles, giving us a chance to clearly see what's working and what's not. Societies can be reborn in such crises, emerging fresh, strong, and refocused. Now is our opportunity to anticipate what that brighter future will look like and to take the steps that will get us there faster.</p><p></p><p>With his trademark blend of wit, irreverence, and rigorous research and analysis, Florida presents an optimistic and counterintuitive vision of our future, calling into question long-held beliefs about the nature of economic progress and forcing us to reassess our very way of life. He argues convincingly that it's time to turn our efforts&#x2014;as individuals, as governments, and as a society&#x2014;to putting the necessary pieces in place for a vibrant, prosperous future. </p><p>Author of the bestselling <em>The Rise of the Creative Class</em> and <em>Who's Your City?</em> Richard Florida is a regular columnist for <em>The Atlantic</em>.
